        "content": "While there have been fleeting moments of euphoria in the stock market in 2025, it's been a pretty tough year overall. One particular area that has managed to outmaneuver this year's volatility, however, is quantum computing. As of the closing bell on May 27, theDefiance Quantum ETFhad returned approximately 8% so far t his year -- handily outperforming the returns of theS&P 500,Nasdaq Composite, andDow Jones Industrial Average. Given those dynamics, investors might be tempted to start buying quantum computing stocks right now. Among the most popular names fueling the gains in the Defiance Quantum exchange-traded fund areIonQ(IONQ-1.69%),Rigetti Computing(RGTI-1.55%), andD-Wave Quantum(QBTS3.10%). Let's assess what is fueling the excitement around quantum computing at the moment. From there, I'll dig into valuation trends for the companies referenced above to help determine if now is a good opportunity to own these market-beating stocks. While artificial intelligence (AI) has become a megatrend fueling the stock market to new highs over the last couple of years, I would argue that there is a finite number of end markets contributing to the industry's popularity. What I mean by that is that within the AI realm, areas such as semiconductors, cloud computing, and enterprise software seem to fetch the most enthusiasm. I think this is why chip stocks such asNvidia, software players likePalantir Technologies, and cloud hyperscalersMicrosoft,Amazon, andAlphabethave consistently remained high-profile names pushing the AI narrative forward. In my eyes, investors may be getting a little tired of seeing the same names affiliated with AI opportunities. Perhaps this is why quantum computing -- which can complete mathematical calculations exponentially faster than existing methods of computing -- has started to emerge as a potential \"next big thing\" in the AI landscape. Despite little commercial scale, thetotal addressable market (TAM) for quantum computingis expected to be in the hundreds of billions of dollars, according to estimates compiled by management consulting firm McKinsey & Company. Image source: Getty Images. The chart below illustrates theprice-to-sales(P/S) ratio for IonQ, Rigetti Computing, and D-Wave Quantum over the past year.  IONQ PS Ratiodata byYCharts. The most obvious takeaway from these trends is that the soaring share prices have resulted in pronounced levels ofvaluation expansion. But considering how game-changing quantum computing might be for the AI movement, shouldn't investors look past these valuation multiples? Unfortunately, I think the answer to that is a hard \"no.\" To add some context to the multiples above, consider that the P/S ratios of Amazon andCiscotopped out between 30 and 40 during thepeak days of the dot-com bubble. When you assess IonQ and its peers through that lens, the P/S levels above look unsustainable. Below, investors can see that over the past two decades, the P/S ratios for Cisco, Amazon, and even Nvidia have compressed considerably.  AMZN PS Ratiodata byYCharts. These dynamics make sense. As businesses mature and diversify their products and services, they (hopefully) achieve a path to consistent profitability and begin to be valued based on earnings and cash flow as opposed to revenue. What makes investing in IonQ, Rigetti, and D-Wave Quantum riskier than, say, Amazon and Cisco 20 years ago or Nvidia right now, is that, collectively, these quantum computing companies are only generating tens of millions in revenue whileburning hundreds of millions of dollars annually. A financial profile like that makes reaching profitability and scaling a business an uphill battle. While history is not guaranteed to repeat itself, I think it is highly likely that shares of IonQ, Rigetti, and D-Wave will begin to witness some pressure sooner than later. As a result, there could be extreme levels of compression in valuation multiples. Ultimately, I think thequantum computing stocks I've talked about here are speculative. They're geared more for day traders and less appealing for investors with a long-run horizon. I would pass on IonQ, Rigetti, and D-Wave Quantum and prefer to continue investing in megacap technology stocks going forward. Their diversified business models are more appealing and provide them with the financial flexibility to explore quantum computing if they choose to do so down the road.",

        "header": "4 Reasons Meta Platforms Is the Best AI Stock of the \"Magnificent Seven\"",
        "content": "Amid the wild swings on Wall Street this year, it may come as a surprise to some investors that theS&P 500index is up 1% in 2025, as of this writing. The stock market has overcome economic and U.S. trade policy concerns, fueled by a solid first-quarter earnings season. Shares ofMeta Platforms(META1.42%)have outperformed, with a 14% gain year to date, amid market optimism regarding the company's ability to capitalize on the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. In many ways, the long-term outlook for the social media and technology giant is as strong as ever. Here are four reasons why Meta Platforms may be the best AI stock of the \"Magnificent Seven\" right now. Image source: Getty Images. Meta Platforms distinguishes itself through pioneering innovation in social media, with over 3.4 billion monthly active users across its ecosystem, including Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. These platforms are central to users' online identities and modern digital communication. By leveraging this vast user base, Meta harnesses unparalleled data from user interactions, providing a key edge in its AI development, including the Llama 4 large language model (LLM). Unlike hyperscalers likeMicrosoftandAmazon, whose AI strategies depend on selling cloud-based AI services to external clients, Meta's strength lies in directly applying its AI models to enhance its core advertising business. This approach boosts conversion rates through precision targeting while increasing user engagement with sophisticated content algorithms. This self-sustaining model enables Meta to refine and deploy AI innovations internally, unaffected by shifting AI data center demand. Additionally, Meta's investments pave the way for transformative advancements in the metaverse and augmented reality. This strategic focus promises to create new revenue streams, underscoring Meta's bright outlook for driving future growth in the evolving digital landscape. Meta's AI strategy is paying off, with signs that its operating and financial momentum is just getting started. In the first quarter of 2025, revenue rose 16% year over year, while net income soared 35% to a record $16.6 billion, or $6.43 in earnings per share (EPS) based on the AI-powered monetization. Despite higher AI investment, Meta generated $10.3 billion in free cash flow during the quarter, supporting long-term goals. Wall Street analysts anticipate Meta's robust performance to continue, forecasting 14% revenue growth for 2025 and 2026, with average annual EPS growth of nearly 10% over the period. Meta's ability to adjust its capital expenditures (capex) within the 2025 guidance range of $64 billion to $72 billion, depending on market conditions, ensures sustained earnings and cash-flow strength. Meta's strong earnings outlook underscores its operational resilience, which is particularly vital amid ongoing concerns about new U.S.tariffstargeting imported goods. Proposed tariffs are disruptive for technology titans like Amazon,Apple, andNvidia, which rely on global supply chains. In contrast, Meta's digital-first business model is relatively insulated from these tariff-related risks, allowing the company to maintain stability and capitalize on AI-driven growth regardless of trade policy shifts. This resilience positions Meta as a stable investment in an environment where tariff-related volatility remains a concern. Meta Platforms stands out as a top AI stock because of its attractive valuation. With a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 25, Meta trades at a large discount to its Magnificent Seven peers, including Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and Nvidia, which average an earnings multiple closer to 32. While internet giantAlphabetis the exception, trading at a forward P/E of 18, it faces significant regulatory scrutiny that introduces unique risks. Alphabet's dominant position in online search through Google has drawn intense scrutiny from global regulators amid ongoing antitrust investigations, a challenge Meta has largely avoided. Given Meta's increasingly high-tech profile, double-digit earnings growth, and fundamental advantages, I believe the stock remains undervalued with significant price-appreciation potential.  Data byYCharts. Meta Platforms stock is a great option for investors seeking to build a diversified portfolio with exposure to high-level themes in technology and AI, two of the most important forces shaping the global economy. In my view, Meta is not just the best AI stock among the Magnificent Seven, but one of the top investment opportunities marketwide, and it's well-positioned to continue rewarding shareholders.",

        "content": "Nvidia(NVDA0.49%)shares recovered nicely after the April market swoon. The stock is now just 10% off its all-time high, as of this writing. After a correction that bottomed on April 5, Nvidia shares have rocketed 48% higher. That compares to just a 27% rebound by theNasdaq Compositesince its early-April low. Some may believe that will mean Nvidia shares could level off while the overall index catches up as other high-growth tech companies also benefit from the surge in spending for artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure. I'd argue that Nvidia will continue to outpace its peers, though, as the next phases of AI build-out and development will also lead to surging sales and profits for Nvidia. Image source: Getty Images. The first stage of the AI wave has been adding massive amounts of computing power to build and train models. Nvidia's sales exploded fourfold in its data center segment in just the last two years, materially by sellingadvanced graphics processing units (GPUs)needed for those powerful computer clusters. As thelarge language models (LLMs)built with that chip power multiply, another phase in the AI revolution is taking center stage. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang called it out in the company's recent fiscal 2026 first-quarter report, released May 28. Huang said: Global demand for Nvidia's AI infrastructure is incredibly strong. AI inference token generation has surged tenfold in just one year, and as AI agents become mainstream, the demand for AI computing will accelerate. AI inferencerefers to the practical application of using LLMs in the real world. The abundance of LLMs now include OpenAI's ChatGPT and Anthropic's Claude, as well as many AI-powered search engines and chatbot platforms using multiple LLMs. Private and public enterprises are also running their own custom models tapping into LLMs. The inference tokens Huang refers to are units of data -- groups of text that the models read, process, and generate. That occurs after any question is answered, or an AI agent does a task. Tokens need a query or prompt when they are processed by GPUs. The volume of those queries is unsurprisingly growing and becoming more complex. The more complex the interaction, the more tokens it consumes. As with AI training, Nvidia is dominant in inference. Nvidia is now leading the global development of AI factories. That's a smart strategy that helps take advantage of the entire AI ecosystem by keeping it in-house as much as practical. AI factories are effectively highlyadvanced data centers. AI factories do more than just store and process data. They host the full life cycle of AI from data input, training, tweaking, and calibrating, to the voluminous amount of inference. The result gives enterprises the ability to enable prediction, generate content, and perform reasoning to seek solutions. Nvidia's products play roles in all of these functions. The company supplies software that optimizes its most advanced GPUs to lower per-token costs for customers. Nvidia offers an example where integrating software optimizations and adopting the latest-generation chips reduced costs by up to 20-fold versus older GPUs and processes. Customers can thus seemore material returns on investment. The market is global for Nvidia. It is partnering with Saudi Arabia's state-owned AI company Humain to build AI factories that will utilize hundreds of thousands of Nvidia's most advanced GPUs as they are developed in the next several years. Nvidia realized a massive amount of success over the last several years as AI technology entered the mainstream with chatbots. Plans to build infrastructure blossomed, and Nvidia was the primary supplier able to support what was necessary to build and train models. More services are now being built around the LLMs, too. Nvidia has software stacks to support the models and supercomputers along with related services. Competition may rise around GPU supply, but Nvidia has many more products to continue growing revenue as AI expands across virtually every sector. Investorsowning Nvidia stock nowshould have a solid chance of beating the market for years to come.",

        "content": "Warren Buffett isn't known for his tech investing -- even less so,artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. But right now, Buffett's holding company has bet nearly $2 billion on a business that sits at the center of the AI revolution. Most investors don't realize this well-known company is an AI giant, making the stock a solid long-term bet for those looking to follow one of Buffett's biggest positions right now. Most people think ofAmazon(AMZN0.34%)as an e-commerce business. And that's certainly true. Nearly 40% of all e-commerce sales in the U.S. are facilitated through Amazon. And most of Amazon's revenue still is generated from digital retail sales. But when you look atoperating profits, the story shifts dramatically. Most of Amazon's operating profits are generated by its Amazon Web Services division, more commonly referred to simply as AWS. So while AWS contributes less than 20% of total sales, it's the primary contributor of Amazon's profitability. In recent quarters, AWS has grown its share of Amazon's revenue pie while also demonstrating higher profitability levels. This should come as no surprise, given the massive rise in spending for AI infrastructure. Nearly every AI application requires cloud infrastructure to train and deploy the models necessary to function. Building out independent infrastructure for every application isn't cost effective. With cloud infrastructure, developers can scale storage and compute demand dynamically, based on their needs and the needs of their customers. The result is a more flexible, capable, and cost-effective back end. When it comes to cloud computing, scale matters. The bigger a cloud network is, the better it can serve customers through additional data routing options and server capabilities. But cost and access are also key factors. The bigger the scale, the more a cloud provider can scale its fixed costs, passing these savings on to customers. With greater scale also comes greater buying power.Nvidia's next-gen Blackwell chips -- coveted by nearly every AI developer -- sold out for 12 months last year. With a leading 30% global market share -- nearly as big as the next two competitors combined -- Amazon's scale gives it durable competitive advantages across the board, especially when it comes to cost, reach, and sourcing high-demand, low-supply chips. Worldwide spending on AI is expected to reach $632 billion by 2028, growing at a rate of 29% annually. Next decade, many forecasts believe the market size will be several trillion dollars. Already the market leader with sustained profitability, expect AWS to eclipse the e-commerce segment's importance over the next five years. Image source: Getty Images. Nvidia has taken the AI market by storm with its next-gen GPUs. Right now, roughly 80% to 90% of data center GPUs use Nvidia's products. Because the AI industry heavily relies on data centers, Nvidia has become a go-to stock for AI investors. But with such a dominant data center market share, might Amazon be the market's next favorite AI stock? While the e-commerce division offers huge value, I'm guessing it is the promise of AWS that drew Buffett and his team to the stock. The growth potential is clear, with Amazon in the driver's seat. This growth opportunity should be one of the biggest in company history, able to be sustained for years, if not decades. Currently, Amazon has a competitive advantage due to scale, while Nvidia's position is mostly due to technological superiority and software lock-in. As previous chip wars have proven, however, competition will rise for Nvidia over time. Amazon's position, meanwhile, may actually strengthen over time due to compounding scale advantages. That will be doubly true if it can provide mass availability of next-gen GPUs before the competition does. Already commanding a market capitalization of $2.2 trillion, Amazon won't generate magnificent returns. But growth in AWS makes the stock a long-term buy, with the potential to overtake Nvidia in the years to come.",

        "content": "Dollar Tree (DLTR) shares fell in premarket trading Wednesday after the discount retailer warned of a hit to its current-quarter profit because of tariffs. The company posted first-quarter adjustedearnings per share (EPS)of $1.26 on net sales that increased 11% year-over-year to $4.64 billion. Analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha were expecting $1.17 and $4.53 billion, respectively. Comparable store sales rose by 5.4%, better than the 3.78% jump analysts had forecast. The retailer held its full-year sales outlook steady but increased its adjusted EPS forecast to $5.15 to $5.65 from the prior $5.00 to $5.50 range, reflecting the more than $500 million in stock buybacks the company has undertaken year-to-date. For the second quarter, Dollar Tree expects comparable net sales growth \"towards the higher end\" of its 3% to 5% full-year forecast. However, adjusted EPS is seen down possibly 45% to 50% year-over-year as Dollar Tree works to mitigate and absorb the cost of tariffs. The company said it expects \"some earnings volatility\" before adjusted EPS rises in the third and fourth quarters. Last quarter, Dollar Tree announced plans to sell its Family Dollar brand to a pair of private-equity firms for $1 billion. Dollar Tree said Wednesday the Family Dollar sale is still expected to close in the second quarter. Dollar Tree shares were down 2% shortly following Wednesday's report.

        "content": "Shares ofNvidiapartner and data center equipment companyVertiv Holdings(VRT1.27%), surged by 26.2% in May, according to data fromS&P Global Market Intelligence. The startling increase occurred as the market's fears of a slowdown in the artificial intelligence/data center market proved unfounded, and numerous anecdotal and factual data points helped support the idea of an extended uptrend in capital spending on data center equipment. Here's the lowdown. Image source: Getty Images. As noted, therewerelegitimate fears around the marketplace. For example, Vertiv itself reported flat year-over-year order growth in the fourth quarter of 2024, andMicrosoftwas widely reported to have pulled back on some investments in data centers  earlier this year. These sorts of developments create fears that the market is set to slow in 2026, leaving the valuations of companies such as Vertiv exposed. That said, you can get a good read on what's going on in a market by looking at suppliers, equipment companies, and the spending plans of key customers, most of which confirmed no sign of any slowdown. For example, aspreviously discussed, various companies have provided excellent market outlooks in recent months. For example, management at electrical connection and protection companynVent, a company growing its data center exposure, sees accelerating demand for its solutions,while mechanical and electrical contractorComfort Systemssees no let-up in demand for contractors on data centers. Vertiv itself reported earnings in late April, and management noted that its one-year pipeline was growing, as was its pipeline beyond one year. As for Microsoft and another hyperscaler,Alphabet's Google, the latter's management confirmed its capital spending plans for 2025 and stated that it was \"definitely\" increasing its spending onAI.  Meanwhile, it turns out that Microsoft's pullback on investment in specific locations is more of a case of rebalancing investment where it needs data centers to match demand rather than any pullback in general. Finally,Nvidia's recent resultsconfirmed that the company's underlying demand remains in growth mode. With the growth of AI applications driving increased spending on data centers, the outlook remains bright for Vertiv. In addition,  Vertiv is already working on the power equipment necessary to work with the next generation of Nvidia's platforms for data centers to be released in 2027. That could drive the next wave of growth for the industry.",

        "header": "3 No-Brainer Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "The burgeoning artificial intelligence (AI) market boasts no shortage of high-flying stocks. Yet today's volatilemacroeconomicclimate, fueled by the Trump administration's ever-evolvingtariff policies, necessitates choosing AI businesses that can thrive through this unpredictability. Three AI companies with the ability to do so areDell Technologies(DELL1.64%),Nvidia(NVDA0.49%), andTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(TSM2.20%), commonly called TSMC. Amid an uncertain economy, these companies have demonstrated AI success, indicating the potential for prosperity over the long run when economic conditions improve. Not only that, but investing in all three gives you exposure to key segments of the AI ecosystem. Nvidia designs AI semiconductor chips, TSMC manufactures them, and Dell uses them in the hardware sold to customers. Here's a deeper look into each. Image source: Getty Images. TSMC is one of the industry leaders in AI chip manufacturing thanks to its cutting-edge 3 nanometer (nm) process. The miniature size involved in 3nm, which is about the diameter of human DNA, allows more components on each chip. This delivers superior microprocessor speed and computational power. The chipmaker's tiny tech has powered outsize sales growth. In the first quarter, its revenue rose 35% year over year to $25.5 billion, or 839.3 billion in New Taiwan dollars, as 3nm sales contributed 22% of income, up from just 9% a year ago. Despite today's macroeconomic uncertainty, the company expects Q2 revenue to reach between $28.4 billion and $29.2 billion. That would be a substantial jump up from the prior year's $20.8 billion, continuing the strong year-over-year growth seen in the first quarter. Along with growing revenue, TSMC possesses strong financials. Its Q1 balance sheet boasted total assets of NT$7.1 trillion with cash and marketable securities of NT$2.7 trillion, and that cash pile alone eclipsed total liabilities of NT$2.5 trillion. TSMC's combination of advanced tech and financial strength make it a great AI investment. AI leader Nvidia is not immune to the current macroeconomic situation, but results for its fiscal first quarter, ended April 27, affirm that the semiconductor giant is still firing on all cylinders. Revenue rose 69% year over year to $44.1 billion. The results are despite the Trump administration's trade policies diminishing Nvidia's sales to China, which led the semiconductor giant to incur a substantial $4.5 billion charge in Q1 associated with excess inventory previously earmarked for Chinese customers. Nvidia's sales growth contributed to expanding profits. Q1 net income soared 26% year over year to $18.8 billion. The bottom-line growth benefited shareholders by driving dilutedearnings per share(EPS) to $0.76, a 27% year-over-year increase. The company's revenue expansion is thanks to its popular AI products, and that success is poised to continue. The company's new Blackwell platform brings artificial intelligence systems into the age of AI reasoning, where AI begins to mimic human thinking. This marks the point at which AI becomes a must-have for organizations, with Nvidia positioned to benefit. CEO Jensen Huang said in the Q1 earnings report, \"Countries around the world are recognizing AI as essential infrastructure -- just like electricity and the internet -- and Nvidia stands at the center of this profound transformation.\" Dell made a name for itself with customizable PCs, but today, its bread and butter is selling AI-optimized hardware for businesses. The company is seeing exceptional customer demand for its products. Chief Operating Officer Jeff Clarke noted AI-related orders in its 2026 fiscal first quarter, ended May 2, exceeded \"the entirety of shipments in all of FY25.\" This positions Dell for a strong year ahead. In fiscal Q1, the company achieved record revenue of $6.3 billion in its servers and networking business. Overall, Q1 sales hit $23.4 billion, a 5% year-over-year increase. Moreover, Dell estimates fiscal Q2 sales to accelerate, coming in between $28.5 billion and $29.5 billion. That would be at least a 14% jump up from the prior year's $25 billion. Even better news for investors is the company's 2026 fiscal year forecast for diluted EPS, which Dell expects will grow 25% year over year to $7.99 at the midpoint of its guidance. Clarke highlighted one of Dell's keys to success, stating, \"Our industry-leading supply chain is a unique advantage in the dynamic environment we are operating in today.\" This helped Dell attain record Q1cash flow from operationsof $2.8 billion. In addition, Dell's stock valuation is appealing, making now a good time to grab shares. Here's a look at Dell's, TSMC's, and Nvidia'sforward price-to-earnings(P/E) ratios.  Data byYCharts. Dell's forward P/E multiple is low compared to its AI brethren, indicating its stock is a good value. In fact, the current macroeconomic uncertainty caused the forward earnings multiple to drop for Dell, TSMC, and Nvidia, making all three stocks a better value than at the start of the year. Thesecular trendof AI is delivering a tailwind to these businesses, and forecasts estimate the AI market to expand from 2024's $184 billion to a whopping $826 billion by 2030. This industry growth and the improvement in TSMC, Nvidia, and Dell's share price valuations make all three great stocks to buy now and hold over thelong term.",

The stock has only eight buy equivalent ratings and is dominated by 16 holds, with five sells, making it one of the lowest rated S&P 500 stocks, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. But bullish investors say the Street is overlooking a company poised to benefit from the current geopolitical and macroeconomic backdrop. Palantir works with the US military, which has doubled its use of the Maven AI system, and intelligence agencies. It recently added NATO as a customer and is partnering with Fannie Mae to launch an AI-powered crime detection unit. It\u2019s also building out its commercial and international clients, both large potential growth areas. Palantir\u2019s rebound from April has been underscored by a broader market pivot as investors navigate Trump\u2019s on-again, off-again tariff rhetoric and search for companies offering relative safety, including those that can show solid future growth. Palantir forecasts sales will rise to $3.9 billion for the calendar year 2025, a 36% increase from the previous year, and will continue to grow. This year\u2019s free cash flow is forecast to top $1.5 billion, a more than 30% increase on the year. \u201cThe market is having capital flow back into areas of the market that they believe could have idiosyncratic growth,\u201d said David Wagner, portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors LLC. \u201cAnd Palantir fits that bill if you could stomach the valuation.\u201d The recovery in technology stocks has shifted toward software and away from hardware, also giving Palantir a boost. It has also become a beneficiary of Elon Musk\u2019s DOGE effort to cut federal spending; the company has continued to land US government contracts during the Trump administration. In another comparison to Tesla, the stock has likely gotten a lift from the retail crowd. In the last week, it was the third most active behind Tesla and Nvidia Corp., according to data from Interactive Brokers. Palantir has stayed in the third-place spot for much of the year, according to Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers. Of course, stocks that have rapid rallies like Palantir can get hit hard on the downside \u2014 it shed more than 40% from a February peak through the early April nadir, mirroring some of the selling seen in other big technology shares. In addition to middle-of-the-road ratings, Wall Street analysts think the current rally has gotten ahead of itself. The average price target of about $103 implies more than 20% downside from where shares currently trade. Palantir also has an increasingly high bar to clear to keep the stock grinding higher \u2014 anything short of outperformance could weigh on shares, as was seen in the brief selloff following last quarter\u2019s earnings report. \u201cThey have to deliver\u201d to keep momentum going forward, said Ted Mortonson, managing director at Robert W Baird & Co. \u201cThey cannot have any hiccups.\u201d Tech Chart of the Day Nvidia Corp. rallied on Tuesday to reclaim the title of the world\u2019s largest company after surpassing Microsoft Corp.

Here's what investors need to know today. U.S. stock futures are pointing slightly higher as investors looked past trade tensions between the U.S. and China.Nasdaqfutures are 0.1% higher after the tech-focused index gained 0.8% in the prior session tomove into positive territoryfor 2025 for the first time since February.S&P 500andDow Jones Industrial Averagefutures are showing similar gains after moving 0.6% and 0.5% higher, respectively, on Tuesday. Bitcoin(BTCUSD) is trading 1% lower at a little above $105,000. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note and oil futures are little changed. Gold futures are slightly lower. President Donald Trumpwrote in a social media postthat China's President Xi Jinping was \"extremely hard to make a deal with,\" raising more questions about progress on a trade deal between the countries. The comment comes after thetwo sidesaccused each other of violating the temporary trade truce they struck inGenevalast month. That surprise deal saw the two dramatically roll back tariffs on each other's imports for a 90-day period to give the two sides time to negotiate. Trump had set a 145% tariff on Chinese imports before dialing it back to 30% for the interim period. CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) shares are dropping 7% in premarket trading after the cybersecurity firm delivered a current-quarter revenue outlook that waslower than analysts' projections. For the first quarter, CrowdStrike reported adjustedearnings per share (EPS)of $0.73, above Visible Alpha consensus, on revenue that increased 20% year-over-year to $1.1 billion, roughly in line with expectations. However, its Q2 revenue projection of $1.14 billion to $1.15 billion was a tick below estimates. The stock had closed at an all-time high Tuesday before the results. Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) shares are surging 6% in premarket trading after the firm's fiscal second-quarterresults topped estimates.The server maker reported adjusted EPS of $0.38 on revenue that rose 6% to $7.63 billion, both above Visible Alpha consensus. The company's current-quarter revenue forecast also topped projections. The results come afterBloombergreported in April that activist investor Elliott Investment Management had built a more than$1.5 billion stakein the company. Dollar Tree (DLTR) shares are falling 2% in premarket trading after thediscount retailer warned that tariffscould take a bite out of its current-quarter profit.Dollar Tree forecasted that Q2 adjusted EPS could be down 45% to 50% as the retailer works to mitigate and absorb the cost of tariffs. The company's first-quarter adjusted EPS, net sales, and comparable store sales all topped analysts' estimates. Dollar Tree shares entered the day up 29% this year.",

        "content": "The Federal Reserve has lifted restrictions imposed on Wells Fargo's (WFC) growth seven years ago following a series ofscandals, including one where staff set up fake accounts. The news that the Fed had removed the approximately $1.95 trillion cap on the bank\u2019s assets sent Wells Fargo shares soaring in premarket trading.\u00a0On Tuesday, Wells Fargo said that the Fed\u2019s Board of Governors had concluded that the lender had met the conditions the regulator had imposed to improve its governance and risk controls. The bank also said it had met the Fed condition that a third-party review its work independently. \u201cThe Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to lift the asset cap marks a pivotal milestone in our journey to transform Wells Fargo,\u201d Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf said. \u201cWe have changed and simplified our business mix, and we have transformed the management team and how we run the company,\u201d he added. Citi analysts said the \u201cmost meaningful benefits of the removal are that WFC can take on more commercial deposits and use more balance sheet to fund trading growth; however, we don't expect immediate tailwinds to loan growth or expense efficiencies.\u201dCiti said that loan growth has been limited less by the asset cap than the uncertain economy that is weighing on loan demand. The brokerage, which has a neutral call on Well Fargo, said most of the removal of the cap has already been priced in. Scharf also noted the work of the company\u2019s 215,000 employees and announced plans to give full-time employees a special $2,000 award, with most of the staffers getting the funds as a restricted stock grant.

        "content": "Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid onApple Podcasts,Spotify,Amazon Music,YouTubeor wherever you find your favorite podcasts. Qualcomm's (QCOM) next 40 years will look different than its past four decades as it seeks to diversify into data centers and cash in on the AI gold rush. But that also likely means going at things other than its lucrative business with Apple's (AAPL) iPhone. Qualcomm has been Apple's largest cellular modem provider, but the tech giant is transitioning to its own in-house C1 modem in a bid to boost margins. \"That's our contract, you know, and if we don't get a new contract, that's what it is,\" Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon said on Yahoo Finance'sOpening Bidpodcast (see video above; listen below). \"And there's so much drama and association about the Apple relationship, which I think it's not warranted, to be honest.\" The tech duo's licensing agreement ends in 2027. Research firm Futurum estimates that Qualcomm's annual modem revenue from Apple is between $5.7 billion and $5.9 billion.Analysts estimateQualcomm will pull in about $43.5 billion in sales this year. Qualcomm has said publicly it expects to have a 70% share in iPhones launching this fall. That will drop to 20% for iPhones next fall, and then stand to be zero for iPhones debuting in fall 2027. Yahoo Finance caught up with the globe-trotting Amon \u2014 fresh off a visit to Saudi Arabia with other top execs and the Trump administration \u2014 at the Nasdaq. Amon began his career at Qualcomm as an engineer in 1995. \"We're planning our business assuming that they [Apple] are going to use their own modem,\" Amon said. \"And what's exciting about the company is all of this growth that we're creating, all of those other markets, including on Android. Like, if you look at our Android business, it has continued to grow.\" To offset the lost Apple sales, Qualcomm continues to invest in the connected car cockpit and the internet of things domain. The company thinks it can grow its business from these two segments to $22 billion by 2030, up from $8.3 billion in fiscal year 2024. \"Qualcomm's diversified growth across these specific verticals is credibly expected to significantly exceed the revenue scale of modem-only handset customers well into the era of 6G,\" Futurum researchers wrote in a note.  The company also announced in mid-May that it plans to launch processors designed for data centers to power artificial intelligence, which will connect to Nvidia (NVDA) chips. Qualcomm failed to successfully expand into data centers years ago and returns to the field with formidable rivals in AMD (AMD), Intel (INTC), and soon ARM (ARM). \"It's a massive TAM [total addressable market] and will continue to grow at very high growth rates for decades. If we can build something unique and disruptive, there's room for Qualcomm,\" Amon said of the data center push. The Street has taken a wait-and-see approach to Qualcomm's stock, preferring to witness tangible progress in diversifying its business away from Apple. Qualcomm's stock has been trading at a price-to-earnings ratio discount to the S&P 500 (^GSPC) for the past three years, according to data from Evercore ISI tech analyst Mark Lipacis. The current P/E multiple is roughly a 39% discount to the S&P 500. The stock also trades at a more than 20% discount versus its 20-year median P/E. Shares are down 28% in the past year compared to a 13% advance for the S&P 500. \"We expect Qualcomm's P/E to continue trading at a discount to the market until it demonstrates more traction into the IoT, Auto and PC markets,\" Lipacis added.

        "content": "After soaring more than 800% between 2023 and 2024,Nvidia(NVDA0.70%)stock came to a screeching halt this year. Investors are worried about its long-term future, and they're also concerned about how tariffs might hurt it in the short term. So far, company performance has been easing their fears. Nvidia sailed past expectations in the fiscal 2026 first quarter (ended April 27), and the stock jumped. Can that continue? Let's see whether a $10,000 investment in Nvidia stock today could become $1 million in 10 years. Image source: Getty Images. Nvidia is the leader in graphics processing units (GPU), the chips that drive power-intensive applications like generative artificial intelligence (AI) and gaming. It has as much as 95% of the overall market, and the market, especially for data centers that support generative AI, is expanding rapidly. It has been a leader in GPUs for years, but its growth accelerated significantly with the development of generative AI, and it continues to experience fantastic growth. Sales increased 69% year over year in the first quarter, beating analyst expectations, andnon-GAAP(adjusted) earnings per share (EPS) were $0.81, topping the $0.75 that analysts were expecting. Huang did give some warnings. Nvidia's top and bottom lines were hit because it's limited by law in what it can ship to China, and it incurred a $4.5 billion charge related to shipments that had to be scrapped in the first quarter. Non-GAAPgross marginwas 61% instead of 71.3%, and EPS would have been $0.96. Longer term, Huang is worried that shutting the U.S. out of China gives China an incentive to develop its own strong AI technology. However, he sees generative AI becoming a basic element of human life. \"As AI agents become mainstream, the demand for AI computing will accelerate,\" he said. \"Countries around the world are recognizing AI as essential infrastructure -- just like electricity and the internet -- and Nvidia stands at the center of this profound transformation.\" To turn $10,000 into $1 million, Nvidia stock would need to increase a hundredfold, or 10,000%. Over the past 10 years, Nvidia stock has increased by more than 24,000%, and an initial $10,000 investment would now be worth over $2.4 million. Can Nvidia stock achieve that again over the next 10 years? Sadly, the answer is almost definitely no. Nvidia has $148 billion in trailing 12-month sales. Last year, revenue increased 114%, but it's already slowing down. It's simply much, much harder to report that kind of increase as the base gets bigger. That's why companies likeWalmartandAmazon, the two largest in the U.S. by sales, report much lower sales growth\u00a0(5.1% and 11% respectively last year), even though they're top companies. If we imagine that sales grow at acompound annual growth rate(CAGR) of 30% over the next 10 years, sales would reach $1.8 trillion, which seems highly unlikely. It's more likely that as the base grows, the rate will slow. If it grows at a CAGR of 20% over the next 10 years, which is also improbable, it would reach $800 billion in sales, which might be more reasonable in 10 years' time. Keeping its current price-to-sales ratio of 26 constant would lead to a market cap of more than $20 trillion, which even in 10 years doesn't seem likely. But even if it were, it would be only about 7 times the current market cap, not 100. A lower price-to-sales ratio would mean a lower market cap, making it even less likely for your investment to increase a hundredfold. That doesn't mean you shouldn't invest in Nvidia today. It has massive growth opportunities as the top name in its industry. But keep your expectations in check, and don't expect Nvidia to repeat its explosive performance in the next decade.",

After the bell Tuesday, the company reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.05 on revenue that increased 9% year-over-year to $187.3 million, both just above Visible Alpha consensus. Asana's Q1 net retention rate (NRR) was 95%, while analysts were looking for 96%. In Tuesday's earnings call, CFO Sonalee Parekh said the company expects Q2 NRR to be \"pressured,\" because of a \"combination of continued downgrade pressure, particularly in our enterprise and middle-market segments and the technology vertical.\" Parekh said that Asana is confident it will improve its NRR in the long run, but noted that in the near term the metric \"will remain a headwind, which results in strong new business momentum and scaling contribution from add-ons and the channel being less prominently reflected in our overall revenue growth.\" COO Anne Raimondi said the company is \"beginning to see some increased buyer scrutiny and elongation in decisions related to broader consolidation or software stack transformation efforts.\" The quarter was Asana's first posting a positive adjusted operating margin, leading the company to lift its full-year forecast for the metric to 5.5%, up from 5% previously. Asana shares entered the day down about 6% on the year, having mostly recovered from the drop thatfollowed last quarter's report, when the company announced co-founder CEO Dustin Moskovitz would be stepping down as soon as a new chief executive was named. Asana said then that Moskovitz would continue as board chair and planned to retain his shares.",

The move isn't sudden or unusual. Huang's sale was set up in March and is part of a scheduled program that allows executives to sell stock without violating insider trading rules. These sales occur at predetermined times, regardless of market conditions or company performance. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. Huang, who still owns over 922 million shares, more than 3.7% of Nvidia, remains one of the chip giant's biggest shareholders. The sale amounts to less than 1% of his stake and appears to be more about locking in gains than losing faith. Nvidia stock has skyrocketed 1,400% over the past five years, and Huang has played a central role in that run. He recently described the company as being off to the races in its next phase of AI-driven growth. Based on the one year price targets offered by 51 analysts, the average target price for NVIDIA Corp is $174.45 with a high estimate of $372.87 and a low estimate of $100.00. The average target implies a upside of +23.53% from the current price of $141.22. Based on GuruFocus estimates, the estimated GF Value for NVIDIA Corp in one year is $273.32, suggesting a upside of +93.54% from the current price of $141.22.

President Trump cited this data print as a new reason for Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to cut interest rates. In another social media post, President Trump claimed it has beenvery difficult to reach a trade deal with Chinese President Xi Jinping. This comes as the Trump administration has rolled out new 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. Nvidia (NVDA) shares have rallied and soared higher, the chip company surpassing Microsoft (MSFT) in total market cap andreclaiming its title as the world's most valuable company. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Briefhere. Welcome to Yahoo Finance's flagship show, The Morning Brief, I'm Brad Smith, alongside Madison Mills. Let's get to the three things that you need to know today. First up, US stock futures off session highs this morning as ADP employment data show hiring decelerated to the slowest pace in two years. Private sector payrolls increased by just 37,000 last month, lower than all estimates in a Bloomberg survey of economists. That marked the second month in a row where the figures fell below expectations. The president was quick to react on social media, saying the Federal Reserve needs to lower interest rates, quote, now. Plus, President Trump also saying it is, quote, extremely hard to make a deal with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, at a time when the White House has been suggesting that the two leaders could talk this week amid rising trade tensions. The commentary comes after the president signed an order raising steel and aluminum tariffs to 50% from 25%. So, that's effective today and the move is seen as increasing trade tensions ahead of a July 9th deadline for negotiations with trading partners. And Nvidia regaining its title as the world's most valuable company. Shares have staged a more than $1 trillion rebound in two months. Investors are betting that the rally has more room to run. The stock has rallied more than 45% since an April low, pushing Nvidia's market value to $3.4 trillion. That beats out its big tech peers in the space like Apple and Microsoft, which is now the world's largest, second largest company by market value.

        "content": "I\u2019m long APLD.  Applied Digital is a developer of next-generation infrastructure for AI. They have two segments: (i) custom-built, high-performance data centers; and (ii) GPUs as a service. Applied is currently focused on a large 400MW data center project in Ellendale, ND, and is marketing a 1.4GW pipeline of additional capacity. Please see the company\u2019s latest investor presentation on their website for more details.   There is a frenzy for compute power by both hyperscalers and Fortune 500 companies, covered extensively everywhere you look. Power and datacenter capacity is the new bottleneck. Nvidia\u2019s CEO, Jensen, has and continues to discuss the need to modernize a trillion dollars worth of data centers to tap into AI\u2019s potential. APLD is a first mover aiming to capture this opportunity.  APLD\u2019s history in developing power hungry crypto hosting sites in low-cost power locations was the perfect preparation for today\u2019s AI opportunity. APLD\u2019s foray into North Dakota for cheap electricity to fund crypto mining left the company with relationships and access to massive low cost power, low cost land with space for expansion, room for additional wind/solar farms to be integrated, state tax incentives, and cooler temperatures which are beneficial for the TCO of high density AI data centers. A healthy dose of luck contributed to locking up this opportunity, industry participants have told me you cannot underscore just how valuable this power and first mover advantage is for prospective customers. If GPUs are the pickaxes behind the AI revolution, power guys are swinging the axes.  **Unit Economics and Valuation**  **HPC Data Centers** The rule of thumb for data centers is it costs $8-12 million per MW to build and each MW can generate ~$1mm of NOI. Applied Digital\u2019s Ellendale campus has signed 250 MW of 15-year leases with CoreWeave, expected to generate $7 billion of total revenue over those 15 years (\u2248$466.7 million per year). That works out to \u2248$1.867 million of revenue per MW per year. Assuming a typical HPC/data center EBITDA margin of 50\u201360 %, each MW will likely produce $0.9\u2013$1.2 million of NOI per year. Therefore, the 250 MW currently under contract should yield $233\u2013$280 million of NOI annually. At a 5\u20136 % cap rate, that implies an enterprise value (TEV) in the $3.9\u2013$5.6 billion range for the signed 250 MW. If the full 400 MW build is leased at similar economics, total NOI would be $360\u2013$480 million per year, implying TEV of $6\u2013$9.6 billion. The remaining 150 MW of backlog could contribute up to $150 million of additional annual NOI\u2014i.e., another $2.5\u2013$3 billion of TEV\u2014if signed at comparable rates.   Locking in the 250 MW CoreWeave lease translates into roughly $3.3\u2013$5.17b of equity, or about $15\u2013$23 per share. Each additional 100 MW of backlog, using $0.9\u2013$1.2 m of NOI per MW and a 5\u20136 % cap rate, would be worth approximately $5/share using the same math. If Applied is able to lock in 1.4GW of projects, that\u2019s an additional $70/share of value that could be created. Haircut all of this however you prefer. The numbers can get wild.  **Applied Digital Cloud** This segment has not been a focus for the company or the investment community recently, but is an underappreciated lotto ticket. Think of it as an early-stage CoreWeave. The business model is simple: they purchase GPUs from NVDA, install them in data centers, and lease them to customers for a fixed contract term that is typically 2-3 years. The GPUs typically pay for themselves during the initial lease term, leaving Applied Digital Cloud owning them free and clear at the end of the lease term for several more years of use. Applied takes very little risk here because at the time they purchase the GPUs there is already a contract in place for a full pay back of the equipment.  The NVDA investment is especially important for this segment because this is where NVDA can drive Applied\u2019s future success. The hyperscalers are working on their own chips and are frienemies, so it is in NVDA\u2019s long-term interest to ensure that there is a healthy ecosystem to support the consumption of their GPUs. They want companies like Applied and CoreWeave to prosper. NVDA can assure Applied\u2019s success in a variety of ways by providing: (i) early allocations of the latest products; (ii) the best customer prospects who want to consume NVDA\u2019s products as a service; and (iii) capital.  Consider what NVDA\u2019s support did for CoreWeave. NVDA invested $100MM in CoreWeave in 2023 at a $2BN valuation. As of September 2024 CoreWeave was raising money at a $23BN valuation\u2026. And look at where they are now.   Valuing this segment is tricky because it is just getting started. If we assume it\u2019s worth just 10% of CoreWeave, that\u2019s $7BN. And it goes up from there. In the fullness of time, if Applied Digital Cloud prospers, then the company will spin this out as a separate company.     **The High Level Setup** Based on the recently announced data center lease with CoreWeave, it is clear that APLD is the real deal and has a chance to be a leader in the next gen data center buildout. BUT despite the recent surge in stock price, it has yet to go from zero to hero with the stock price still being vastly under valued.   Applied Digital will be the only pure play next-gen data center player in the public markets. There is no short thesis when NVDA and Related are anchor investors and a hyperscaler is a long-term partner and customer. APLD will fundamentally be worth a lot more than current prices, the stock should disconnect from any fundamental grounding as a result of being a public pureplay on the next AI bottleneck. The right tail asymmetry of this investment is under appreciated.    **TLDR:** Company that used to mine magic internet money accidentally built a gold mine for AI. Now NVDA\u2019s homies are renting it out, and the GPU gods might bless them with infinite tendies. Bags secured, brain not required  [Positions](https://imgur.com/a/iJFz6g7)",

I looked into this when my wife came home with the wrong type of thumb drive for her stupid Macbook (a Sandisk that requires a USB - thank you Apple for removing those fucking ports on everything). Was curious if this was a company I could short and then learned what they were doing. Now I think this is a sleeper pick that nobody's really paying attention to.  **Product deep dive:**  * NVIDIA certified Sandisk\u2019s Gen5 eSSDs for datacenter use. Certification means they're officially in the vendor chain for AI servers. * Additionally, they've also built something called High Bandwidth Flash (HBF) which is a new memory architecture built for massive memory capacity and throughput (important for AI). Nobody else is making this and it's developed in-house (one of the main reasons I bought). * Sandisk is shipping one of the most power-efficient flash technologies available right now, BiCS8. * Cloud sales\u201412% of Sandisk\u2019s total output went to AWS/GCP/Azure this quarter, up from 8% a year ago. My employer is one of these and our AI spend is essentially a blank check. It's kind of an arms race right now. * AI spend isn't going to stop. I work in a part of a FAANG where we're seeing complete transformation plans to overhaul our customer-facing service into an AI-heavy experience. Yes a lot of companies are bleeding money on this but a lot aren't. I see the sales numbers and the internal productivity boost we've gotten is insane.  **Brand shift:**  Yes they do still make consumer stuff. But IGAF about thumb drives sold at Walmart. What they are building gives them a seat at the table for large AI-related deals.  **Earnings TLDR:**  * Revenue: $1.7B * Adjusted free cash flow: $220M * Cash on hand: $1.5B * Forecast: demand strengthening through year-end * Gross margin took a hit (22.7%), but they\u2019re working on it through pricing and cost controls  This was their first full quarter as a standalone company after separating from Western Digital. Still early.  **Other areas they\u2019re moving into:**  * **EV**: Flash tech being used for autonomous driving, just nominated Ford Supplier of the Year. NOTE: I am not an EV person and haven't really gone down this rabbit hole. I'm just looking into the AI side. * **Gaming**: Their new SSDs are winning \u201cBest Of\u201d awards * **Content creation**: Rolled out pro-grade memory cards and high-performance portable SSDs  **Risks:**  * Gross margins were down this quarter\u2014mostly due to pricing pressure and the usual NAND volatility * Consumer segment is still soft * Goodwill impairment made GAAP numbers ugly (-$1.8B), though this was non-cash and tied to the separation * This is absolutely a lotto play. * Thin options liquidity.

We\u2019re seeing this correlation year after year. No. 1\u2026Microsoftretook the top spot fromNvidia. It was followed by Nvidia (No. 2),Delta Air Lines(No. 3),Alphabet(No. 4), andEli Lillyand Company (No. 5). $180,000\u2026 the median EBITDA per employee of companies in the top 25 of the ROL100. By comparison, the median EBITDA of companies in the bottom 25 of the ranking is $44,000. +8.3%\u2026 the median three-year revenue growth of companies in the top 25 of the ROL100. The median three-year revenue growth of companies in the bottom 25 of the ranking is +5.1%, by comparison. Microsoft edges out Nvidia\u2014barely. This year, Microsoft has reclaimed the No. 1 spot on the ROL100 from Nvidia, though both companies continue to lead the field when it comes to Corporate America\u2019s best leaders. Microsoft\u2019s return to the top reflects its consistent strength in driving strategic clarity, fostering leadership alignment, and executing with focused discipline across its sprawling business.Under CEO Satya Nadella\u2019s leadership, Microsoft has excelled in cultivating a growth mindset culture and encouraging innovation while maintaining operational excellence. The company\u2019s clear vision for cloud computing, AI integration, and enterprise solutions keeps its leadership team tightly aligned around priorities that drive long-term value. Meanwhile, Nvidia remains a formidable presence on the list, praised for its visionary leadership and agile execution in the fast-evolving semiconductor and AI chip sector.CEO Jensen Huangcontinues to guide Nvidia with remarkable strategic clarity, positioning the company as a trailblazer in GPU technology as well as AI training and inference. Nvidia\u2019s leadership team is highly aligned and focused, enabling rapid innovation cycles and market responsiveness that keep it at the forefront of its industry. Improving its rank by one notch this year to third place is Delta Air Lines, a factits chief executive attributes to its corporate culture. \u201cFor a hundred years, Delta leaders have put our values and our people at the forefront of everything we do,\u201d says CEO Ed Bastian. \u201cSo we know from experience that companies that consistently live their values also regularly outperform their competitors.\u201d Health care and tech sit at the top. In the three previous ROL100 rankings, the health care industry consistently had the highest number of companies in the top 25. Last year, however, the technology sector surged ahead to claim the top spot. For the 2025 list, it was a tie: Both information technology and health care each represented 24% of the companies in the top 25. Forward-thinking leadership delivers real results. The correlation between financial success and a high ranking on ReturnOnLeadership is so strong that S&P Dow Jones Indices, a subsidiary of S&P Global, recently added a dedicated product for investors to track companies on Indiggo\u2019s list. Over the past five years, Indiggo\u2019s ReturnOnLeadership Index (+109%) has outpaced both the S&P 500 (+91%) and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (+64%). \u201cThis reinforces what we all know: how critical the leadership factor is to stock market performance,\u201d Janeen Gelbart, CEO of Indiggo, tellsFortune.

These initiatives reflect a commitment to technological advancement and strategic partnerships. During the last quarter, NVIDIA's stock price rose by 28%, reflecting a broader trend in the market which experienced a 13% rise over a year. The company's developments likely added weight to this upward trajectory, reflecting strong performance against a backdrop of flat market activity in the recent week. We've identified 1 risk with NVIDIA and understanding the impact should be part of your investment process. Diversify your portfolio with solid dividend payers offering reliable income streams to weather potential market turbulence. NVIDIA's recent collaboration to develop Ada and SPARK programming languages, alongside its focus on AI startups, showcases its intent to deepen its presence in the automotive sector. These moves could bolster NVIDIA's revenue forecasts by driving growth in AI and data centers, key areas of focus according to analyst predictions, with annual revenue growth estimated at 30.3% over the next three years. The initiatives are likely to support further advancements in NVIDIA's Blackwell architecture, potentially enhancing earnings through increased demand for AI capabilities. Over a five-year period, NVIDIA's total shareholder return, incorporating both share price and dividends, surged by a very large percentage. This long-term performance puts NVIDIA well above its recent one-year return, which exceeded the broader US market's 12.6% rise. Despite this impressive growth, the current share price of US$113.54 remains below the consensus analyst price target of US$163.12, indicating a potential increase of 30.4%. This discrepancy suggests potential room for share price appreciation, contingent on continued execution of NVIDIA\u2019s growth initiatives and market conditions.

        "content": "Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) is about to head into one interesting summer. One that includes cost-cutting, a battle with the Department of Justice, and likely talks with a feared activist investor. HPE CEOAntonio Neritells me his team is up to the tasks. Shares traded around flat on Wednesday, with the company appearing to have stabilized its key server business after a surprisingly poor quarter three months earlier. Execs said they have tightened up the economics around server deal pricing and are holding managers more accountable for performance. The business has \"bottomed,\" Neri said. Margins in the business still tanked to 5.9% from 11% a year ago. The more challenging demand backdrop has also hurt server rival Dell (DELL). HPE predicted that its efforts to right the ship, which include a heavy dose of cost-cutting, could get server segment margins to 10% by the end of the fourth quarter. Its other segments in intelligent edge and hybrid cloud delivered margin improvement in the second quarter. Still, HPE remains in a period of transition with a couple of key factors that could influence the direction of the stock. The company announced several months ago that it would slash 3,000 jobs, equating to 5% of its workforce. On Tuesday's earnings call, executives said \"nothing is off limits\" on the cost-cutting front. HPE expects to save about $350 million from the layoffs. In July, the company is heading to trial against the DOJ for its blocked $14 billion deal to acquire Cisco (CSCO) rival Juniper Networks (JNPR). The outcome of the deal continues to be unknown. The DOJ had sued to stop the deal due to concerns about lessening competition. \"The DOJ's thesis is flawed,\" Neri said, pointing to a host of competitors in the networking space. The end result could dictate how HPE addresses feared activist investor Elliott Management, which in April revealed a $1.5 billion stake in HPE. Elliott's intentions on HPE are unclear, and a spokesperson didn't return Yahoo Finance's request for comment. But Elliott's playbook often shakes up a company's board to unlock shareholder value, either by enacting a new stock buyback plan or fresh cost-cutting commitments. HPE certainly has the cash to consider a buyback to appease Elliott if the Juniper deal falls through. The company currently has $11.7 billion in cash, equating to an outsized 50% of its market cap. \"In addition to management highlighting the focus on cost management and efficiency ... the team also highlighted the appetite for pursuing capital return and portfolio actions beyond current endeavors, which in aggregate could drive enthusiasm with investors who have already been closely watching for further developments following the involvement of Elliott as an activist shareholder,\" JPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee wrote in a note. Neri said Elliott is a \"smart\" investor, and he remains open to listening for ideas that could drive value for HPE shareholders. Brian Sozziis Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) has reclaimed the title of most valuable US company, as shares soar past $140. Wealth hostBrad Smithbreaks down what's driving the artificial intelligence (AI) giant's latest rally and CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s $123 billion net worth. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Wealthhere. Nvidia is once again the largest US company by market cap. The AI darling has a market cap of $3.45 trillion, just barely surpassing its fellow MAG 7 member, Microsoft. Investors fled into the stock back in January, as part of the AI scare around China's Deepseek. They fled out of it, and then ultimately, a broader tech route and concerns over China chip curbs have kept this stock below the $140 per share marker since February. But get this, shares closed above that level Tuesday, rocketing up nearly 50% from April lows. And that means big gains for CEO Jensen Huang. As of June 3rd, Jensen Huang is the 12th richest person alive, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Huang has a net worth of over $123 billion, and the majority of which is in his ownership of Nvidia stock. He owns about 860 million shares, according to a filing from early March. Huang recently got his first base salary pay bump in a decade. His base salary as the president and CEO of Nvidia for fiscal 2025 is $1.5 million. That's up 50% from fiscal 2024. Variable cash opportunity, or compensation based on certain performance metrics that also increased 50% from last year to $3 million. And Huang's target equity opportunity, or compensation through stock options or other equity awards, that rose by 25% to $27.5 million, slightly above the median of his peers. Nvidia shares are up 5% year-to-date, and Huang's net worth has increased by nearly $9.3 billion in 2025.",

        "content": "Shares ofCoreWeave(CRWV8.38%)rocketed 169.5% in May, according to data fromS&P Global Market Intelligence. CoreWeave had a busy month, not only recovering from April's \"Liberation Day\" along with the rest of the sector, but also holding its first earnings report since its March 28 initial public offering (IPO). Additionally, key customer and supplierNvidia(NVDA0.51%)disclosed that it had increased its investment in the company. Virtually all technology stocks and artificial intelligence (AI) stocks recovered in a big way after May 12, when the U.S. and China ratcheted down their mutual tariffs for 90 days in order to let trade talks proceed. The sky-high China tariffs had been at the heart of the worries over President Trump's tariff war, which had especially weighed on thesemiconductor and AI sectors. Shortly after the rollback of China tariffs, CoreWeave also held its first-ever earnings release. In that release, CoreWeave beat revenue expectations handily. And while earnings per share missed by a lot, that was caused by one-time stock compensation costs associated with the IPO. Moreover, CoreWeave raised its revenue guidance for the year well above analyst estimates, although it also increased its outlook forcapital expenditures. While investors had something of a mixed reaction to earnings, most Wall Street analysts raised their price targets afterward. But just days later, CoreWeave saw a massive spike in its stock after it was revealed that AI chip darling Nvidia hadincreased its investment in the company. That was followed by evenlarger analyst price target increasesthe following week. Image source: Getty Images. Not only did CoreWeave have a monster month of May, but the stock has also surged to begin June, following news of a 15-year, $7 billion data center expansion agreement with data center operatorApplied Digital(APLD29.56%). Given the massive spike in the stock price, there's a degree ofmeme stockmomentum right now in CoreWeave. So investors should be careful with the stock at this valuation, which currently sits at about 15 times this year's revenue outlook. That's a high price for a stock with high investment needs and some substantial risks. One concern is that CoreWeave has to invest substantial amounts in fixed assets ahead of receiving revenues from its contracts. However, it appears investors are encouraged by the more aggressive growth outlook and willing to look past upfront investment needs in fixed costs that will probably require CoreWeave to raise more capital. Another risk that concerns me is the company's circular relationship with Nvidia, which is both a customer and, obviously, a key supplier. While AI demand and demand for Nvidia chips appears quite strong for now, should either demand ever slow down, CoreWeave could run into problems.",

        "content": "We recently published a list of10 AI Stocks on Wall Street\u2019s Radar. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other AI stocks on Wall Street\u2019s radar. On June 3rd, Citi analyst Atif Malik reiterated a Buy rating on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) with a $180.00 price target. The analysts have pointed out Nvidia\u2019s strategic focus on artificial intelligence (AI) networking, highlighting the company\u2019s efforts to optimize compute and storage with its networking operating system, Dynamo. Dynamo is intended to achieve the lowest total cost of ownership for tokens per second per user. Moreover, the company\u2019s first-quarter results have demonstrated a significant 64% quarter-over-quarter growth in its networking segment, backed by both scale-up and scale-out products. This growth has, in turn, led to the company\u2019s remarkable 86.17% year-over-year revenue growth and 70.11% gross profit margin. A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. The company\u2019s NVLink solutions have grossed over $1 billion in sales. Meanwhile, its Spectrum-X (Ethernet) portfolio has achieved two new customers, contributing to a quarterly run-rate of $2 billion. Even though Infiniband is the gold standard for hyperscalers, Ethernet is also becoming a preferred choice due to its familiarity. Discussing the NVLink, analysts noted that this specialized scale-up platform connects 72 GPUs and benefits larger language models. Customers can purchase only the components they need for their AI infrastructure, such as super NICS and switches, without having to purchase the entire stack. Noting Co-Packaged Optics (CPO) in relation to NVLink, the analysts said that while copper is low power and cost-effective, it can create noise on the PCB. Placing optics next to ASICs will help the company to eliminate the need for additional digital signal processors and retimers, optimizing its AI networking solutions even further. NVIDIA specializes in AI-driven solutions, offering platforms for data centers, self-driving cars, robotics, and cloud services.

        "content": "Apple (AAPL), one of the famedMagnificent Sevenstocks, is no longer a \"buy,\" according to analysts at Needham. The iPhone maker\u2019s valuation is too pricey compared with itsBig Tech peersand doesn\u2019t appear primed for a strong device upgrade cycle, Needham wrote to clients Wednesday.Analyst Laura Martin downgraded Apple to\u201chold\u201d from \u201cbuy\u201dand withdrew its price target of $225. \u201cWe move to the sidelines for AAPL owing to its expensive relativevaluation, increasing fundamental growth headwinds, and rising competitive threats,\u201d Martin said in the research report. Apple\u2019s share-price growth is dependent on a successfuliPhone upgrade cycle, which Needham doesn\u2019t expect within the next year, even with the iPhone 17 expected to drop this fall. The downgrade comes as Apple has turned in one of the worst performances among the Magnificent Seven stocks so far in 2025. The stock is currently neck-and-neck with Tesla (TSLA) for that title, with both down about 18% this year. Smartphone demand in general is under pressure, technology analysis firm Counterpoint Research said Wednesday.The group revised downward its global smartphone shipment growth forecast to 1.9% in 2025\u2014below its prior estimate of 4.2%\u2014citing theimpact of U.S. tariffs. North America shipments are expected to decline 3% this year, easily the worst projection for any region. \"All eyes are on Apple and Samsung because of their exposure to the US market,\u201d Counterpoint Associate Director Liz Lee said. \u201cAlthough tariffs have played a role in our forecast revisions, we are also factoring in weakened demand.\u201d President Donald Trumpwarned Applelast month that the administration will impose a tariff of at least 25% on iPhones sold in the U.S. that are made in other countries, including in India, where the company has shifted production to avoid import taxes on China. One issue for Apple, relative to its peers, is that its strides in artificial intelligence can only be used to improve its own ecosystem, Needham said. Meanwhile, Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) can drive revenue by charging other companies a fee to use itsGemini models, and Amazon (AMZN) makes money from firms using its Amazon Web Services. \u201cAAPL does not own a Cloud business so this becomes acost center, rather than a new [revenue] and margin upside driver,\u201d Needham said. Apple will get a chance to make its case for the future at its Worldwide Developers Conference next week.The company is expected to introduce an iOS update as well as a potential new AI partnership with Google, according to Goldman Sachs analysts. Of the 12 analysts covering Apple tracked by Visible Alpha besides Needham, eight have \"buy\" or equivalent ratings, with two \"hold,\" and two \"sell\" ratings. Their targets range from $170 to $270. Apple shares were little changed in recent trading, just above $203 a share. (ReadInvestopedia's full coverage oftoday's trading here.)",

Several other firms have raised their targets for the index in recent weeks, citing easing global trade tensions, continued resilience of the U.S. economy, and the stimulative potential of the tax and spending bill working its way through Congress. Deutsche Bank on Tuesdayraised its year-end forecastto 6,550, and UBS last week lifted its target to 6,000. The stock market's outlook may have improved in the last month, but it remains drearier than at the start of the year, when investors were optimistic about President-elect Donald Trump's pro-growth, business-friendly agenda. Only two Wall Street firms tracked byCNBC's Market Strategist Survey have not lowered their expectations for the S&P 500 this year. Barclays analysts left their forecast for S&P 500 full-yearearnings per shareunchanged at $262, down from $271 at the start of the year. Many of President Trump's tariffs have been delayed or diluted, but those that remain are expected to directly subtract nearly $10 from the index's EPS. Slower international growth and diminished consumer spending are expected to detract an additional $1 and $2.10, respectively. Better-than-expected first-quarter earnings and tariff-induced inflation are forecast to offset some of those headwinds. Barclays expects corporate earnings growth to normalize in 2026, when\u2014assuming tariff rates remain unchanged\u2014the direct drag from duties will get lost in year-over-year comparisons. Tariffs are still expected to weigh on consumer spending and slow global growth, but those headwinds should be more than offset by AI-driven growth.

Retirement drawdowns refer to the process of withdrawing money from retirement accounts to fund living expenses after you stop working. Planning this aspect of your retirement is crucial because how you access your funds directly impacts how much you ultimately have available to spend. A well-defined plan can help youavoid unnecessary taxesand extend the life of your savings. Taxes can take a significant bite out of your retirement income. Every dollar you pay in taxes is one less you have for living expenses and enjoying your golden years. \"In my experience, retirees hate taxes, and oftentimes, avoiding some taxes today means paying substantially more taxes later,\" saidDavid Rae, a Los Angeles- and Palm Springs-based financial planner and president of DRM Wealth Management. A tax-efficient withdrawal strategy minimizes this impact by carefully considering which accounts to tap and when, potentially extending the life of your savings and maximizing your money. In fact, research has found that proper withdrawal planning can extend retirement savings by three years or more, essentially giving you \"free money\" through tax savings. Understanding the tax treatment of different retirement accounts is fundamental to developing an effectivewithdrawal strategy. Traditional IRAs and 401(k)s:Contributions are often made with pre-tax dollars, meaning you don't pay taxes on the money you contribute in the year you contribute. However, withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income. Roth IRAsand Roth 401(k)s:Contributions are made with money you've already paid taxes on. The primary advantage is that qualified withdrawals in retirement are completely tax-free. Taxable investment accounts:These are brokerage accounts where you invest with after-tax dollars. You pay taxes on any profits, including capital gains and dividends. However, the tax rates on long-term capital gains are often lower than ordinary income tax rates. The traditional approach involves a specific sequence of withdrawals: taxable accounts first, then tax-deferred accounts (such as traditional IRAs and 401(k)s), and finally, tax-free Roth accounts. The underlying principle is to delay paying taxes on tax-advantaged accounts as long as possible, allowing those investments more time to potentially grow. In contrast to the sequential approach, the proportional strategy involves withdrawing a certain percentage from each account type (taxable, tax-deferred, and tax-free) each year. This method aims to maintain a relatively consistent ratio across your accounts, which can help manage your overall tax liability more evenly throughout retirement. Kayla R. Fernandezof California Financial Advisors highlighted the benefits of this approach, particularly for those with substantial pre-tax accounts. \"A proportional withdrawal strategy can be especially effective for retirees with sizable pre-tax accounts like 401(k)s, 403(b)s, or IRAs,\" she said. \"The core benefit is that this approach can allow retirees to optimize tax efficiency by utilizing lower income tax years and reducing the risk of larger, bracket-accelerating distributions in future years.\" (Examples include a new car purchase or a big home repair.) Proportional withdrawals may benefit those anticipating higher future tax rates or who have years with substantial medical expenses qualifying as itemized deductions. They can also help minimize the taxation ofSocial Security benefitsand preserve tax-favored basis in taxable accounts. One tactic to help minimize your taxes is planning aroundcapital gains. Capital gains\u2014the profit from selling investments in taxable accounts\u2014are taxed at different rates depending on how long you held the asset and your overall income.Strategically timing your sales can allow you to take advantage of lower tax rates on long-term capital gains and potentially keep you within a lowertax bracket. Hilary Hendershott, a financial advisor and the founder of Hendershott Wealth Management, emphasizes the importance of proactive planning. \"Many retirees don't realize they have more control over their capital gains taxes than other forms of retirement income,\" she said. She recommends thinking of retirement income in three buckets: Hendershott suggested withdrawing from taxable investment accounts first for that third bucket. \"Only the gains portion is taxable, which means you have room to maneuver and reduce that tax\u2013or avoid it entirely,\" she said. You should also opt to gift or donate appreciated assets in taxable accounts. \"Giving your child appreciated shares from your taxable account shifts the gains from selling from your tax return to their return,\" said Hendershott. \"If they're under the 15% capital-gains bracket, the tax owed could be zero.\" Tax-loss harvestingis another technique for minimizing taxes, especially during market volatility. \"Tax loss harvesting can be extremely valuable when markets get bumpy,\" Rae said. \"With some savvy trading, retirees could minimize or eliminate capital gains over the next few years.\" This involves selling losing investments to offset capital gains, potentially reducing your overall tax liability. The IRS requires you to start withdrawing from your tax-deferred accounts at a certain age (currently 73 for most people), which is also known asrequired minimum distributions. Hendershott emphasizes the importance ofearly planning for RMDs. \"For most people, RMDs kick in the year they turn 73, and you must take the first one by April 1 of the following year and every December 31 after that,\" she said.\"At our firm, we start estimating those payouts a decade, sometimes more, before they hit because early planning can prevent your taxes from snowballing later on.\" Waiting until you are forced to take RMDs leaves you little wiggle room to minimize taxes on your retirement income, and you'll be overpaying them, according to Rae. \"If you ignore RMDs until you are required to take them, you will be overpaying taxes in retirement,\" he said. Failing to take RMDs can result in significant penalties and negatively impact your overall retirement strategy. Converting funds from traditional IRAs to Roth IRAscan be particularly valuable in the early retirement years before receiving Social Security benefits or being subject to RMDs. \"These years can often represent a tax trough where income is temporarily lower, creating an ideal environment for paying taxes on conversions at reduced rates,\" Fernandez said. Hiliary adds that when projections show excess RMDs, she often recommendsconverting fundsfrom a traditional IRA to a Roth. \"You'll pay the tax up front and must wait five years before touching the converted dollars, but shrinking the IRA now can save more in forced taxable withdrawals down the road,\" she said. Fernandez, Rae, and Hendershott all highlighted charitable giving as a strategy. Qualified charitable distributions (QCDs) allow those over 70\u00bd to donate up to $108,000 annually (for tax year 2025) directly from IRAs to qualified charities.This satisfies all or part of an RMD and excludes the donated amount from taxable income, which is especially beneficial for those taking the standard deduction. Your income level during retirement significantly influences your tax rates on withdrawals and capital gains. If you anticipate being in a lower tax bracket in the future, delaying withdrawals from your tax-deferred accounts might be advantageous. Conversely, if you expect your tax bracket to be higher later, it might be prudent to draw down some of those funds earlier, potentially at a lower tax rate. Remember that Social Security benefits may be taxable, and the amount subject to taxation depends on your other income. Avoidingtax-related mistakesis as crucial as implementing sound withdrawal strategies. One frequent issue that Fernandez said she sees is not coordinating account withdrawals for tax efficiency. Withdrawing from just one type of account without considering a blend of taxable, tax-deferred, and Roth resources can lead to inefficient tax outcomes. She noted that sometimes drawing from a Roth account earlier is beneficial, especially during temporary income spikes. According to Fernandez, another common mistake isinefficient asset allocationacross account types. Examples include allocating CDs in taxable accounts, overlooking Treasuries, or placing tax-efficient investments like municipal bonds in retirement accounts. Another pitfall is rolling over 401(k) assets to an IRA before consideringnet unrealized appreciation(NUA). Under specific conditions, Fernandez said this strategy allows gains on employer stock within retirement plans to be taxed at typically lower long-term capital gains rates. The difference between the two comes down to taxes. Regular withdrawal strategies may focus solely on accessing funds as needed, without regard for the tax implications of where the money comes from. Tax-efficient drawdowns, conversely, prioritize strategically choosing which accounts to draw from and when to minimize your tax liability. One of the biggest possible risks is paying more in taxes than necessary, ultimately reducing the amount you have to use in retirement. Doing so can also potentially shorten the lifespan of your savings. As inflation increases living costs, you may need to withdraw more to maintain yourpurchasing power. When making these adjustments, it's crucial to remain tax-efficient. Draw more from taxable investment accounts first, since these funds have already been taxed (beyond any capital gains from selling assets). Due to their tax-advantaged nature, preserve Roth funds for later in retirement or for unexpected expenses. Also, holding investments that tend to keep pace with inflation (like certain bonds or real estate) should be considered to help maintain purchasing power. The4% ruleinvolves withdrawing 4% of retirement funds in your first year of retirement and adjusting that amount for inflation each year. While this is a helpful starting point, it's essential to remember that this is a guideline, and tax efficiency should also be a key consideration in your overall withdrawal strategy. Having a plan for withdrawing retirement money can save you thousands in taxes and help your savings last longer. What matters is knowing how each account type is taxed, choosing withdrawal methods that minimize your tax burden, and paying attention to RMDs and capital gains. Of course, the right approach comes down to your specific financial situation, income, and goals.",

        "content": "Shares ofAdvanced Micro Devices(AMD1.14%)were moving higher last month after the chipmaker posted better-than-expected results in its first-quarter earnings report, signed a deal with a Saudi Arabian artificial intelligence (AI) start-up, and benefited from the broader recovery trend in the market as investors seemed to look past tariff concerns. As a result, AMD finished the month up 14%, according to data fromS&P Global Market Intelligence. As you can see from the chart, most of the stock's gains came in the second week of the month, when its earnings report came out.  AMDdata byYCharts Coming into May, AMD stock had fallen sharply over the last year, as investors had bid up the stock on hopes for its AI chips. However, after a reset in the price, investors are returning to the stock, as it's delivering strong growth, including in the data center, where AI growth is taking place. AMD gained 2% on its earnings report on May 7, as the company reported 36% revenue growth to $7.44 billion, well ahead of the consensus at $7.12 billion. In the data center segment, revenue jumped 57% to $3.7 billion, driven by strong growth of EPYC CPU chips and Instinct GPU chips, which compete directly withNvidia.The client segment, which serves the PC market, was strong as well, with revenue up 68% to $2.3 billion. On the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share jumped from $0.62 to $0.96, edging out estimates at $0.93. The stock rallied in the subsequent days following that report as the U.S. and China agreed to lower tariff rates, and after the Trump administration said it would rescind \"AI diffusion\" rules, which restricted shipments of advanced chips to certain foreign countries. That paved the way for AMD to make a deal with Humain, a Saudi Arabian AI-start-up, as the two companies announced that they would form a $10 billion collaboration to deploy 500 megawatts of AI computer capacity over the next five years. Additionally, AMD announced a $6 billionshare repurchaseauthorization, showing the company aims to take advantage of the discount in the share price. Image source: Getty Images. With momentum building in the data center and a strong performance in the client segment, AMD looks to be in good shape for further gains. The company doesn't have to catch Nvidia to be successful in AI, as there as plenty of spillover demand, as well as companies looking for cheaper options. That should favor AMD as the AI boom continues to play out.",

        "content": "The \u201cTrump Trade\u201d has evolved. How investors should play it is up for debate. The early days of President Donald Trump\u2019s second administration supercharged a climb in stocks that started late last summer, lifting the major indexes and some specific assets\u2014shares of Tesla (TSLA), cryptocurrency\u2014in particular. Sprinkled in was volatility around stock and sectors seen as likely to be helped or hurt by spending and regulatory efforts. Some of that remains in place, but the action these days is largely around global trade policy. Investors are attempting to figure out from day to day what the next twist in Trump\u2019s tariff strategy could be and how it might affect stocks in the hours, days and weeks ahead. That\u2019s taken on particular salience since stocks swooned after the April 2 \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariff announcements and then beganworking their way back. The upshot, for some, is the belief that Trump eventually delays or otherwise modifies policies the market doesn't like, so trade-policy negativity will be shaken off before long. There\u2019s an alliterative nickname for this: the \u201cTACO Trade,\u201d short for \u201cTrump Always Chickens Out,\u201d coined last month by aFinancial Timescolumnist. (Asked about it at a press conference, Trump was unamused.) Discussion of the term has taken on a political character and become fodder for TheWall Street Journal,The New York Times, and other publications\u2014now including this one\u2014but it has also found its way to the lips of investors and analysts. BCA Research mentioned it in a note earlier this week, calling the trade \u201covercooked\u201d and suggesting that investors may have grown too sanguine. \u201cRisk assets price in trade deals and de-escalation along with limited policy damage despite ongoing volatility,\u201d they wrote. Pepperstone analyst Michael Brown in late May effectively equated taco trading withbuying the dip. Deutsche Bank analysts intheir own notethis week didn\u2019t use the taco term, but\u2014in raising their year-end target for the S&P 500\u2014cited the idea that \u201cthe administration had already relented, driven primarily by the market reaction, and before the emergence of significant economic or political pain. This reinforces the view that if negative impacts of tariffs do materialize, we will get further relents.\u201d Other factors have undoubtedly aided stocks in recent weeks even as questions about the path forward for trade and the economy remain. The first-quarter earnings season was generally seen as strong, and Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA)results and outlookhave supported the AI trade. Futures markets indicate an expectation that the Federal Reserve cuts rates twice by the end of the year, as the job market shows signs of weakness and inflation approaches the Fed\u2019s target. JP Morgan analysts on Tuesday shared a calendar of key trade dates in the coming months, noting a litany of summits and policy expirations\u2014a 90-day pause on tariffs against the EU expires next month, and reducedU.S.-China tariffsare set to pass in August\u2014between now and the end of the year. The administration reportedly asked countries to submit their \u201cbest offers\u201d in trade negotiations by Wednesday. Some investors don\u2019t buy the inevitability of bullishness around trade news. \u201cWe think that, unfortunately, as the so-called \u2018TACO Trade\u2019 becomes more viral, it becomes more likely that Trump will stick to higher tariffs just to prove a point,\u201d Panmure Liberum Head of Strategy Joachim Klement recently told aReutersinterviewer.

        "header": "2 Reasons Not to Wait for a Fed Rate Cut Before Locking Your Mortgage Rate",
        "content": "The full article continues below these offers from our partners. Withtoday's mortgage rateshovering in upper-6% to lower-7% territory, it can be tempting to hold out, delaying your purchase of a home until rates come down. And there is some wisdom in putting forth some effort to get the lowest mortgage rate you can secure, since a quarter- or a half-point rate difference can add up to hundreds or even thousands of dollars saved every year. But if you're thinking you'll score a better mortgage rate if you can just wait until theFederal Reservestarts cutting rates later this year, you could be sabotaging your home-buying process. That's because a lower Fed rate is not a sure thing this year. In addition, Fed rate cuts don't necessarily mean mortgage rates will fall. Here's why you're likely better off buying when the time is right for your situation, rather than pegging your timing to the Fed. After lowering interest rates three times between September and December last year, the Federal Reserve moved into neutral with a rate hold in January, followed by further pauses in March and May.Though another Fed rate-setting meeting is upon us in two weeks, the overwhelming expectation is that the central bank will hold its benchmark rate steady yet again. In fact, theCME Group's FedWatch Toolshows markets currently place a 70% probability on the Fed's July meeting resulting in a fifth consecutive rate hold. In addition, it's predicted we won't see a first 2025 rate cut until the meeting after that, which concludes with an announcement on Sept. 18. But that September meeting is more than three months away, and a lot can happen in the economy during that time. In particular, the central bankers are watching closely for impacts of President Donald Trump's ever-evolvingtariffpolicy. For instance, we could seeinflationtick back up. Or we could see negative effects on the job market. These are competing problems and could make the Fed's rate decisions difficult. All this is to say that while thecurrentexpectation is that the Fed will begin lowering rates in September, anything can happen. Given the potential fallout from tariffs and possible trade wars, the Fed has been acknowledging howextremely uncertain things are right now. It's therefore not inconceivable that the central bank could find itself holding rates at this high level for many more months than currently expected. That's the first reason why waiting for a Fed rate cut may not be your best bet if you're ready to move on a mortgage now. But there's another reason. It's a common belief that when the Federal Reserve raises or lowers thefederal funds rate, mortgage rates will move in sync. But in reality, the relationship between the Fed's benchmark rate and what mortgage lenders offer is not quite so direct. Instead, moves by the central bank more directly impact short-term rates, such as those paid on bank accounts as well as those charged on credit card and personal loan balances. Fixed mortgages are instead a long-term rate, and their connection to Fed rate changes is more tenuous. A tangle of economic factors affectthe mortgage lending market, including inflation, consumer demand, housing supply, the strength of the current economy, and the status of the bond market, especially that of10-year Treasury yields. Given these other influences, mortgage rates and the Fed funds rate can move independently\u2014even in opposite directions. That's exactly what we saw in the last quarter of 2024, when mortgage rates shot up despite a bold half-point rate cut in September. Not only that, but after two more Fed reductions, 30-year mortgage rates surged again in late December and January, reaching almost 1.25 percentage points higher than before the Fed's September rate cut. Fallout from President Trump's tariff policy, put into effect on April 2, has also pushed mortgage rates around. Initially, the stock market dropped, sending bond yields lower. This caused a quick mortgage rate decline. But the massive uncertainty surrounding tariffs, and the trade wars they've ignited, later sent bond yields much higher,causing mortgage rates to surge. Since then, the average 30-year mortgage rate has again fallen, continuing a roller coaster ride fueled by market uncertainties waiting to be resolved. Yet all of this mortgage rate movement has occurred while the Fed's rate has not moved an inch. That means for mortgage shoppers, there's no guaranteed payoff from a Fed rate cut, whenever it finally arrives. And no one can reliably predict where mortgage rates are headed the rest of this year\u2014they could move even higher. So instead of looking to the Fed, it's likely best to lock in a mortgage rate whenever the financial timing of a home purchase is right for you and you've found a great house for your needs.

        "content": "Dollar stores are gaining ground with high-income households, companies have said this week. Dollar Tree (DLTR) saw 2.6 million new customers in the latest quarter, and people making at least six figures annually fueled much of that growth, executives said on an earnings conference call Wednesday. Dollar General (DG) on Tuesday said it'sseeing more middle- and high-income customers. That effect has been seen across retailers who say wealthier households are increasingly searching for value, Walmart (WMT)among them. Dollar Tree has been expanding its inventory and addingmerchandise that costs as much as $7, which CEO Michael Creedon credited with bringing in wealthier customers. Still, 85% of items at Dollar Tree cost $2 or less, the company said. \u201cWe believe they\u2019re loving the expanded assortment that multi-price provides,\u201d Creedon said, according to a transcript made available by AlphaSense. Customers are buying items typically consumed right away, such as candy, snacks, and drinks, and returning more frequently, Creedon said.Dollar Treeposted a 9% bump in the number of shoppers who visit a store at least three times per month, he said. \u201cIn the current environment, our low prices and smaller pack sizes are perfect for families trying to manage atight household budget, and our expanded assortment is attractive to all customers across every income level,\u201d Creedon said, according to the transcript. Dollar General\u2019s first-quarter resultsexceeded expectations, but executives warned tariffs may squeeze profits this quarter, sending its stock lower in recent sessions.",

        "content": "Nvidia(NVDA0.51%)might be the company everyone's talking about thanks to its dominance in the high-growth area of artificial intelligence (AI), but it remained behind one other tech player,Microsoft, in terms of market value. Until this week. On June 3, Nvidia roared past the software giant to become the world's most valuable company with a market value of $3.444 trillion. Microsoft's market value totaled $3.441 trillion at the close of trading. This happened a week after Nvidia's fiscal 2026 first-quarter earnings report, one that maintained the company's track record of surpassing analysts' estimates and delivering double-digit revenue growth. And even though investors questioned the strength of AI demand and spending in recent months, Nvidia's words -- and comments from itsbiggest customers-- showed business still is booming. All of this is great news, but can this AI chip powerhouse maintain this position in the market cap top spot? Image source: Getty Images. It's important to note that this isn't the first time Nvidia has claimed the title of the world'smost valuable company. In fact, just a few months ago, in January, Nvidia's market value surpassed those of Microsoft and smartphone giantApple.  NVDA Market Capdata byYCharts But concerns about technology spending weighed heavily on Nvidia shares in recent months, and that pushed market value lower once again. Now, though, two elements clearly are driving this rebound in the AI giant. First, market sentiment and stock performance have improved in recent weeks on optimism that President Donald Trump's import tariffs won't result in extreme headwinds for corporate earnings. The U.S. struck an initial trade deal with China at lower-than-expected tariff levels and is working on a permanent arrangement. Lower tariffs suggest less strain on companies' budgets and on the consumer's wallet. Second, as mentioned, Nvidia reported strong demand for its latest release, the Blackwell architecture and chip, and noted that customers are rushing to the company forinferencing power. Nvidia's chips -- graphics processing units (GPUs) -- fuel this process that allows large language models to think through problems and generate answers. All of this helped Nvidia report a 69% increase in revenue to $44 billion in the quarter and deliver strong profitability on sales. Even including a charge Nvidia took for canceled sales to China following U.S. export controls, Nvidia's gross margin came in at more than 60%. And excluding the impact of the charge, Nvidia met its forecast of gross margin in the low-70% range. On top of this, forecasts showing the AI market will increase from hundreds of billions of dollars today to trillions of dollars by early next decade suggest there's room for Nvidia and other AI leaders to grow. So, will Nvidia keep its title as the world's biggest company? One potential risk to Nvidia's share price performance -- and market value gains -- is the situation concerningthe export of AI chipsto China. Today, U.S. restrictions prevent Nvidia from selling its H20 chip -- one that it designed specifically for the Chinese market -- to that country. If Nvidia remains completely blocked from the Chinese market, revenue growth and stock performance could suffer, at least in the short term. But any progress in that area, even small, could act as a catalyst for share gains. Considering all of these elements, the positive and the negative, I think Nvidia may once again remain neck and neck with Microsoft and Apple when it comes to market cap in the months and quarters to come. We might see each of these companies periodically take the top spot. If tariff issues and the China export situation are completely resolved, though, Nvidia could have the advantage. Nvidia's leadership and innovation in the high-growth AI market as well as its double-digit revenue increases quarter after quarter could eventually push it ahead, making it the world's biggest company for the long term.",

        "content": "Back in 2022, billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller made a sizable bet on chipmakerNvidia. The company has gone on to become one of the biggest winners of advancements ingenerative AI, for which its graphics processing units (GPUs) are well suited. Druckenmiller has also been an investor inPalantir Technologies(PLTR-2.34%), which has used AI to improve its software and expand its market. Druckenmiller has also made a lot of money by investing inAmazon(AMZN0.81%)throughout his career, taking advantage of thecloud computingleader's growth. But Druckenmiller is shifting his attention and his money away from these AI giants. He sold out of Nvidia about a year ago (although he says he regrets that decision). In the first quarter, he got rid of his remaining shares of Palantir and trimmed his Amazon investment by more than half. In their place, he's buying a different company that stands to benefit from continued spending on AI development but whose stock looks undervalued. Image source: Getty Images. Both Amazon and Palantir are producing strong results as enterprise customers spend heavily on AI software and development. Palantir has seen its U.S. commercial business take off thanks to its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP). Businesses are expanding their use cases for AIP, and the service is reducing the need for clients to hire new workers. That has helped Palantir grow revenue extremely quickly without much overhead, resulting in strong earnings growth. Amazon remains the largest public cloud platform in the world with Amazon Web Services (AWS). The company is seeing strong demand for AI services on AWS, and it's spending as quickly as it can to meet that demand, including plans to pour over $100 billion intocapital expenditures(mostly for AWS) in 2025. The operating margin for AWS has soared to nearly 40%, pushing Amazon's operating profits considerably higher. But Druckenmiller's decision to reduce his stake in these companies seems to be based purely on valuation. Indeed,Palantir is one of the most expensive stocks on the markettrading at over 75 times management's 2025 revenue outlook. Druckenmiller has also traded in and out of Amazon stock based on price, and shares reached an all-time high of more than $240 per share last quarter. With all that in mind, it appears Druckenmiller has found a suitable replacement in the AI space that offers exceptional value at its current price. With hyperscalers like Amazon committing to investing billions of dollars per year in AI data centers, the growth in AI spending seems to be far from over. One company stands behind practically all of the silicon chips you'll find in those data centers:Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(TSM2.41%), or TSMC. TSMC is the leading chip manufacturer in the world, commanding a dominant share of the market. Its lead is cemented by the best-in-class technology required for making the most cutting-edge chips. That's whycompanies like Nvidia choose TSMC to print and package its chips. Using another manufacturer would likely result in a higher cost with an inferior product. TSMC benefits from a virtuous cycle. It's the largest chip manufacturer in the world, which means it brings in a ton of revenue. It can, therefore, invest more in research and development and capital expenditures to maintain its technological lead and ensure enough capacity to meet growing demand. That, in turn, brings in more revenue. That said, chip fabrication is a capital-intensive,cyclical business. If demand falls, TSMC is still responsible for maintaining its expensive equipment, even if it's not producing as many chips. The good news for investors is that TSMC also expects strong growth in AI spending through the end of the decade. Management believes AI-related revenue will double this year, and the company could produce a compound annual growth rate of close to 40% for AI chips through 2029. Overall, management is guiding for 20% compound annual growth for the entire business. Revenue is up over 43% year over year through the first four months of 2025. Despite the potential for strong revenue growth over the next five years with excellent gross and operating margin profiles, the stock trades for less than 21 times forward earnings estimates. There's a reason to discount the stock somewhat, given the ongoingglobal trade warlaunched by the Trump Administration and the geopolitical risk surrounding Taiwan. But the current valuation still looks extremely attractive for investors, and Druckenmiller seems to agree. Druckenmiller tiptoed into the stock in the second half of last year, investing about $20 million, but he more than quintupled his investment in the first quarter, making it one of his biggest holdings. With TSMC's share price sitting around where it started the year, there is still an opportunity to join Druckenmiller with an investment in TSMC.",
