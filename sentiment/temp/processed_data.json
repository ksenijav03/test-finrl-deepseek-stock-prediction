        "content": "Oklo (OKLO) shares lost ground Thursday after jumping nearly 30% the previous session following news the nuclear power company had won an Air Force contract. Today's slump came after Oklo late Wednesday announced apublic offeringof $400 million incommon stock. The news partially offset the investor optimism sparked when the company said earlier Wednesday it had tentativelylanded a \"mission-critical\" contractto provide nuclear energy to the Eielson Air Force Base in Alaska. Oklo shares fell 5% to around $64.50 on Thursday. The stock has tripled in value since the start of 2025, fueled recently by President Donald Trump signing newexecutive orders aimed at boosting the nuclear energy industry.\u00a0Stocks in thenuclear energy sectorhave risen over the last year due to the anticipation of growing energy needs torun data centersand train artificial intelligence models. Below, we take a closer look at thetechnicalson Oklo\u2019s chart and point out key price levels that investors will likely be watching. Since bottoming out around the200-day moving average (MA)in early April, Oklo shares have resumed their longer-term uptrend. More recently, the stock consolidated in a bullishflagbefore breaking out above the pattern during Wednesday\u2019s trading session. Importantly, the buying occurred on above-averagevolume, indicating that larger investors participated in the move higher. It's worth noting that, while therelative strength indexconfirms strong price momentum, the indicator has moved into territory that has coincided with briefconsolidationperiods in the stock over the past eight months. Let\u2019s applytechnical analysisto forecast how a new move higher may play out and also identify keysupport levelsworth watching during potential pullbacks. Investors can forecast where Oklo shares may be heading next by using bars pattern analysis, a technique that analyzes priortrendsto project future directional price movements. When applying the analysis to Oklo\u2019s chart, we take the stock\u2019s impulsive move higher last October and overlay it from the flag pattern\u2019sbreakoutpoint. This projects a bullish target of around $135 and indicates the trend may last throughout most of June. We selected this prior trend as it followed an earlier flag pattern on the chart, providing an indication of how a new move from a similar pattern may take shape. The first support level to watch sits around $55. A drop to this level could attract buying interest near the flag pattern\u2019s breakout point and the stock\u2019s prominent Februaryswing high.

Addressing the event, hosted by Yahoo Finance UK and which was a global masterclass for entrepreneurs, Kirkby said that during her career she has \"seen what makes a great tech ecosystems and ... [the UK has] the right ingredients\". \"The UK is a phenomenal place to build something that really matters,\" she said on Tuesday. \"We're Europe's number one destination for tech unicorns.\" BT is the world's oldest telecommunications company (telco), with a 180-year legacy. \"We, despite being 180 years old, continue to play a pivotal role in the UK's growth and prosperity, building the digital foundations and connecting people and businesses across the country to the latest tech and a world of opportunity,\" Kirkby said.

Prior to taking the helm at BT last year, Kirkby had been president and CEO of Swedish telecomms company Telia (TELIA.ST) since May 2020. She also previously held the top roles at Danish telco TDC Group and Swedish mobile network provider Tele2 (TEL2-B.ST), among other executive positions. Her comments echoed those made by Jensen Huang, CEO of chipmaking giant Nvidia (NVDA), in a panel discussion with UK prime minister Keir Starmer and on Monday at the start of London Tech Week. Huang said that the UK has \"one of the richest AI communitiesanywhere on the planet\", adding that it has the \"best universities ... amazing start-ups ... and incredible thinkers in computer science.\" In addition, Huang said the UK has the \"third largest AI venture capital (VC) investment anywhere in the world\".

        "header": "2 Popular AI Stocks to Sell Before They Drop 30% and 55%, According to Select Wall Street Analysts",
        "content": "We are more than two years into the artificial intelligence trade, andPalantir Technologies(PLTR-0.64%)andNvidia(NVDA1.45%)have been standout performers. Their share prices since January 2023 have increased 2,000% and 875%, respectively. But certain Wall Street analysts think it's time to sell. Wall Street seems to agree with Brent Thill where Palantir is concerned. The median target price among 28 analysts is $110 per share, which implies 19% downside. But Jay Goldberg has the lone sell rating on Nvidia, and the median target price among 69 analysts is $175 per share, which implies 22% upside. Here's what investors should know about Palantir and Nvidia. Image source: Getty Images. Palantir develops analytics platforms that help customers make sense of complex information. Its software drives efficiency with nuanced insights that improve operational decision-making. That value proposition is relevant across virtually every industries. Palantir helps banks prevent fraud, manufacturers fortify supply chains, retailers optimize inventory, and defense agencies track and target enemy combatants. Several independent analysts recently recognized the company as a technology leader inartificial intelligenceand machine learning software. \"Palantir is quietly becoming one of the largest players in this market,\" wrote Mike Gualtieri atForrester Research. And CEO Alex Karp says unique software architecture makes Palantir one of the only companies that can move AI projects from prototype to production. Palantir reported solid first-quarter financial results. Revenue increased 39% to $884 million, the seventh consecutive acceleration. Andnon-GAAPnet income increased 62% to $0.13 per diluted share. Additionally, the company raised full-year guidance, such that revenue is now projected to grow 36% in 2025. Management said demand for its artificial intelligence platform was a key tailwind. Brent Thill at Jefferies has consistently praised Palantir for its technology and execution. \"It's a great company. I'm not disputing the fundamentals,\" he said. But Thill has a problem with the valuation. Palantir has a forwardprice-to-sales (PS) ratioabove 80, which makes it the most expensive software stock on the market. In fact, Thill says its price could fall 70% and it would still be the most expensive software stock. Here's my take: I agree wholeheartedly. Palantir is an excellent business that could be worth more in the future. But the risk-reward profile is skewed toward risk today. Shareholders could suffer huge losses if the broader stock market loses momentum or Palantir fails to meet lofty expectations. The most prudent strategy is to trim large positions and avoid buying shares until the valuation is tolerable. Graphics processing units (GPUs) accelerate complexdata centerworkloads like training machine learning models and running artificial intelligence applications.Nvidiamakes the most coveted GPUs on the market. They are not only faster than products from other chipmakers, but also Nvidia has created an unparalleled ecosystem of software tools called CUDA to support developers. Nvidia reported encouraging financial results in the first quarter of fiscal 2026, which ended in April. Revenue rose 69% to $44 billion amid persistent demand for AI infrastructure, and non-GAAP net income increase 33% to $0.81 per diluted share. Importantly, the bottom line increased more slowly than the top line due to the production ramp of the Blackwell chip and inventory write-downs related to export restrictions. Jay Goldberg at Seaport Research recently discussed his sell rating on Nvidia with Yahoo Finance. \"It's a good company that makes great products,\" he noted. \"But they have said already their newest line of products, the Blackwell line, is sold out for the year.\" That leaves little room for upside in his estimation because Nvidia will be hard pressed to beat consensus estimates if it's capacity constrained. So, bias shifts to the downside. Goldberg also noted increasingly severe export controls imposed by the Biden and Trump administrations. Initially, Nvidia was unable to sell its most advanced products to China, butnewer restrictionseffectively bar the company from doing any business in the country. CEO Jensen Huang says the export controls have been a failure, and Nvidia will miss out on hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue. While I think Goldberg is right to be concerned about export restrictions, I am less worried about Blackwell GPUs being sold out this year. The market will likely look past temporary capacity constraints so long as the underlying demand appears strong. Also, Wall Street expects Nvidia's earnings to increase at 40% annually through fiscal 2027, which ends in January 2027. That makes the current valuation of 45 times earnings look reasonable. Here's my take: I think patient shareholders should sit tight. I see no reason to sell Nvidia. The semiconductor industry is cyclical, which can lead to prolonged drawdowns in the stock, but the investment thesis is solid. Data center GPU sales are expected to increase at 29% annually through 2030, and AI spending is forecast to grow at 36% annually over the same period. Nvidia is ideally positioned to benefit.",

        "header": "Is CoreWeave a Buy?",
        "content": "After only a couple of months on the stock market,CoreWeave(CRWV-3.12%)already has made its mark. This is thanks to the company's close ties with artificial intelligence (AI) superpowerNvidia(NVDA-1.25%)and its own soaring levels of revenue in recent times. Investors looking for the next big AI growth story clearly have their eyes on CoreWeave. The company's initial public offering (IPO) fell flat in its first days, but it's important to keep in mind the timing of this event. It happened in late March as investors were preoccupied by Preside Trump's tariffs on imports and their potential impact on the economy -- this weighed on indexes, and particularly on growth stocks. So, this may have hurt early demand for CoreWeave shares. Since, though, the situation has quickly turned around. As the U.S. initiated trade talks with China -- a key country concerned by tariffs -- general market sentiment improved, and this has boosted AI stocks. Meanwhile, CoreWeave also has wowed investors with its triple-digit revenue growth. Is CoreWeave a buy today? Let's find out. Image source: Getty Images. So, first let's consider CoreWeave's business and the company's relationship with Nvidia. CoreWeave's operations actually revolve around the technology of the AI superstar as it offers customers access to its huge fleet of Nvidia AI chips, known asgraphics processing units(GPUs). This AI company on the rise has 250,000 GPUs across more than 30 data centers, and customers can rent access to them -- even on an hourly basis. Don't let this hourly element fool you though -- CoreWeave's contract terms generally span two to five years, offering visibility on revenue to come. Nvidia is a clear believer in the company as it holds a 7% stake, and Nvidia has given CoreWeave priority when it comes to rolling out its latest GPUs. For example, earlier this year, CoreWeave was the first to make Nvidia's Blackwell compute power generally available. Nvidia launched its Blackwell architecture and chip in the fourth quarter of last year, and demand was high, even surpassing supply -- so CoreWeave's ability to rapidly bring this GPU to users was a big deal. CoreWeave hasn't escaped the attention of some of the world's biggest tech companies -- names includingMicrosoft,Meta Platforms, andIBMhave flocked to CoreWeave for access to GPUs as they ramp up their AI platforms. In fact, for the past two years, Microsoft was CoreWeave's biggest customer, representing 35% of revenue in 2023 and 62% in 2024. This market position has translated into major growth for CoreWeave, as we can see in its latest earnings report. Revenue soared more than 400% to $981 million, surpassing analysts' estimates. And a look at annual growth reinforces this, with annual revenue climbing from $16 million in 2022 to $1.9 billion in 2024. So, it looks as if CoreWeave is going strong, and analysts' forecasts of an AI market reaching into the trillions by next decade bodes well for this company's long-term prospects. CoreWeave also says that as AI training andinferencingbecome more widespread, its customer base should grow as well. Now let's get back to our question: Is this AI mover a stock to buy now? It's clear CoreWeave has delivered impressive growth in recent times, and even if the pace slows somewhat, considering the potential of the AI market and demand for computing power, the company should continue to deliver. Yes, it faces bigger cloud rivals that also offer customers access to GPUs, but CoreWeave stands out as it truly specializes in this particular area. This and the depth of demand out there suggest CoreWeave and bigger cloud providers each can score a win. Still, it's important to keep in mind that CoreWeave isn't yet profitable and must invest heavily in GPUs serve customers' needs in a fast-changing and fast-growing market. The company's technology and infrastructure expenses increased more than 500% in the latest quarter. This represents some risk. On top of this, the stock, since its early rough period actually has soared in recent weeks -- it's now up more than 280% since its IPO. All of this means your decision to buy depends on your investment style and strategy. If you're a cautious or value investor, CoreWeave isn't the best fit for your portfolio. But, if you're an aggressive investor who also plans on holding on for the long term, you may want to pick up a few shares of CoreWeave -- in spite of its meteoric rise, it may be in the early days of its growth story and deliver significant gains over the long term.",

        "header": "2 Brilliant Growth Stocks to Buy Now and Hold for the Long Term",
        "content": "Growth stocks can be some of the best tools an investor has to build wealth for retirement. With some of the largest companies in the world in great positions to capitalize on the rising adoption ofartificial intelligence (AI), you can put yourself in a solid position to earn excellent returns without taking a chance on unproven start-ups. Here are two elite growth stocks to buy today and hold for the long term to help you capitalize on AI. Image source: Getty Images. Nvidia(NVDA1.45%)stock has surged close to its previous highs following its latest strong quarterly earnings report in May. In addition to supplying its powerful chips to data centers, the company has adapted itsgraphics processing unit (GPU)technology for other markets, including automotive, gaming, and professional graphics. Thedata centermarket is the company's largest growth driver right now. Last quarter, its sales to data centers grew 73% year over year to $39 billion, accounting for 88% of its total business. Analysts expect surging demand for Nvidia's new Blackwell chips to boost its full-year revenue to $200 billion. With data center operators and hyperscalers expected to spend $1 trillion annually on infrastructure by 2029, according to Dell'Oro Group, Nvidia's revenue could grow quite substantially from there. It has been investing in GPU innovation for decades, and as a result, controls the lion's share of the market. In the desktop GPU market alone, its share is estimated to be 92%. The demand for more advanced AI computing systems isn't slowing down. Nvidia is working with companies worldwide to build AI factories -- new types of data centers designed specifically for AI workloads. Nvidia reported seeing an accelerating deployment of these AI-optimized data centers last quarter. Nvidiais also positioned to help companies build world-changing products like humanoid robots with its Isaac GR00T N1 robot development platform. In the view of CEO Jensen Huang, general-use robots could become a multitrillion-dollar industry. Nvidia could also benefit from the growth of autonomous vehicles thanks to its DRIVE computing platform. Its automotive revenue grew 72% year over year last quarter to $567 million. The stock trades at 33 times forward earnings estimates. This is a reasonableforward price-to-earningsmultiple for a company that is providing the essential computing hardware for the AI era. Image source: Getty Images. Alphabet(GOOG-1.11%)(GOOGL-1.09%)owns some of the most widely used digital services, including YouTube, Google, Android, and Gmail. After the stock fell earlier this year, it's trading at an attractive valuation that may undervalue Alphabet's opportunities in AI. Seven of its products boast more than 2 billion users each. This large installed base of users fuels its advertising business: Alphabet's revenue grew by 12% year over year in Q1 while operating income grew by 20%. Google Search is benefiting from growing user engagement following the launch of new features such as AI Overview. These AI-powered search summaries provide quick explanations for almost any topic, and they appear to be leading to more search queries and more ad revenue opportunities. Google Gemini, its largelanguage model(LLM) chatbot, is now powering many of the company's services. Companies are migrating their data systems to Google Cloud to use AI services for building applications and data analytics. Revenue from Google Cloud grew 28% in the first quarter, and it's starting to have a meaningful impact on the company's profitability, as the segment's operating income more than doubled to $2.2 billion. This is strong growth for a stock trading at just 19 times 2025 earnings estimates. One reason for Wall Street's cautious valuation of the stock is the concern that other leading LLM makers likeChatGPT owner OpenAIcould pull ahead of Alphabet in AI and draw users away from its highly profitable Google Search business. However, investors shouldn't underestimate the amount of money that Alphabet has to invest in AI. The $75 billion infree cash flowit generated over the last year was more than twice what it generated five years prior. And that was after it laid out $57 billion in capital expenditures for technology infrastructure, AI, and data centers. These investments have made Gemini one of the top AI models out there, which could bring more useful features to its services that protect Google's competitive moat, which helps explain why now would be a great time tostart an investment in Alphabet. As the company continues to grow its cloud and advertising businesses, the stock could outperform the broader market.",

While many investors chase the next big AI story, NVDA, TSM, and VRT offer a grounded, but still high-upside path through the AI trade. Below, we break down why these three names still represent compelling GARP (Growth at a Reasonable Price) opportunities within the AI ecosystem. Taiwan Semiconductor plays a critical and irreplaceable role in the global semiconductor supply chain, especially when it comes to leading edge artificial intelligence chips. As the world's largest semiconductor fabricator, TSM is the behind-the-scenes giant enabling advanced computing across industries. In May, the company reported a nearly 40% year-over-year jump in monthly revenue, reflecting surging demand for its cutting-edge AI chips. Looking ahead, Taiwan Semi expects full-year sales to grow by 28.2% in 2025, followed by another 14.8% gain in 2026. Long-term, earnings are forecast to grow at an impressive 20.8% annual rate over the next three to five years, driven by sustained AI and high-performance computing demand. While TSM currently holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), reflecting stable earnings revisions, the growth trajectory remains firmly intact. Valuation-wise, the stock trades at 23.1x forward earnings\u2014right in line with its five-year median. For a company of TSM's strategic importance and growth potential, this multiple appears not just reasonable, but attractive. In a market where many AI plays command stretched premiums, TSM stands out as one of the most compelling large-cap opportunities in the market broadly. Nvidia remains the undisputed leader in AI hardware design, with its GPUs forming the backbone of nearly every major AI training and inference system in the world. Its dominance in the data center space is unmatched, and the company is already positioning itself for the next frontier\u2014expanding into areas like robotics and quantum computing. Fundamentally, Nvidia's growth story remains extraordinary. Analysts project earnings to grow at a staggering 28.2% annually over the next three to five years, fueled by unrelenting demand for AI infrastructure. Sales are expected to surge 51.4% this year, followed by another 25.1% gain next year, highlighting both near-term momentum and long-term scalability. Despite this rapid growth, Nvidia's valuation is far from excessive. Shares currently trade at 36x forward earnings, significantly below the stock's five-year median of 55x. For a company with Nvidia's technological leadership, accelerating fundamentals, and global relevance in AI, today represents an opportunity to buy a high-growth compounder at a historically discounted valuation. Vertiv has quickly emerged as one of the most important behind-the-scenes players in the AI boom, offering critical power and thermal management solutions for data centers\u2014the physical backbone of the AI revolution. After a sharp but short-lived correction in April, the stock has rebounded strongly as investors refocus on the accelerating demand for data center infrastructure. Vertiv's business model is uniquely advantaged. It provides the hardware and services that enable hyperscalers and enterprises to build out AI-ready capacity at scale. With data center spending expected to grow rapidly in the years ahead, Vertiv is well positioned to capture consistent and expanding demand. Vertiv's business is firing on all cylinders. Sales are projected to grow in the high teens for each of the next two years, while earnings are expected to rise at a robust 27.2% annually over the next three to five years. Despite its recent run, gaining a dizzying 700% in the last five years, the stock still trades at 30.6x forward earnings, a premium to its five-year median of 23.3x, but justified by its exceptional growth profile. With a PEG ratio just above 1, Vertiv offers a compelling blend of momentum, earnings power, and long-term upside at a valuation that still makes sense. There are plenty of ways to gain exposure to the AI boom, from speculative software startups to legacy tech names trying to reinvent themselves, but few companies are as essential to the AI supply chain and trade at valuations this grounded. Nvidia, Taiwan Semiconductor, and Vertiv are building the infrastructure to make AI possible. Each company boasts strong earnings and sales growth, durable competitive advantages, and surprisingly reasonable valuations given their dominance and forward outlook. Whether you're a long-term investor seeking growth or someone trying to avoid the froth of more speculative AI names, these three stocks offer a compelling path to participate in one of the most transformative trends of this decade, and without overpaying for the opportunity.

        "header": "5 No-Brainer Artificial intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI)is quickly changing the world we live in. With the technology perhaps being a once-in-a-generation opportunity, it's not too late to invest in the stocks leading the AI charge. Let's look at five leading AI stocks to buy right now. Image source: Getty Images. Palantir Technologies(PLTR-0.64%)is quickly emerging as one of the most compelling growth stories in AI by helping organizations actually put AI to work. By gathering data and structuring it into an \"ontology,\" Palantir's AI platform (AIP) maps digital assets to real-world objects and processes to let customers apply AI to solve real-world problems. AIP is being used for a variety of tasks, from optimizing supply chains to automating underwriting to even monitoring for sepsis in hospitals. While the company has long been an important government vendor, Palantir's growth is currently being powered by the U.S. public sector. Given the wide array of applications across industries that AIP can be used for, Palantir has a massive opportunity in front of it. Recently, Palantir has introduced AI agents within AIP that go beyond analysis to take action. Agentic AI is becoming the next big AI push, and could be a big growth driver for the company. That said, the stock isn't cheap, and government budget cuts could potentially impact growth. Still, Palantir's technology looks unmatched, and the company is well-positioned to be a long-term AI leader. Nvidia(NVDA1.45%)continues to be one of the top ways to invest in the AI infrastructure boom. Itsgraphics processing units (GPUs)are the backbone of AI data centers thanks to their powerful parallel processing capabilities. And as the engine that helps run AI workloads, demand for GPUs continues to soar as organizations race to build and run AI models and apps. Nvidia's real moat, however, comes from itsCUDAsoftware platform, which it created to make it easier for developers to program its chips. Since then, it has built a powerful suite of tools and libraries that further enhance its GPUs' performance for AI workloads. The tight integration between its powerful GPUs and CUDA helped Nvidia attain an over 90% share in the GPU market in Q1. Its new Blackwell chips are ramping up faster than any product in its history, and demand for its full-stack AI \"factories\" continues to surge. Beyond the data center, Nvidia is also gaining traction in the automotive space, with revenue expected to hit $5 billion this year. A slowdown in AI spending is a risk, but Nvidia remains one of the best-positioned companies to benefit from the AI infrastructure build-out. While it may trail Nvidia by a wide margin in the GPU space,Advanced Micro Devices(AMD-2.15%)is nonetheless still carving out a niche in AI infrastructure, especially in inference. While Nvidia's GPUs dominate AI training thanks to its powerful CUDA software platform, inference is a bit of a different story. Inference is less technically demanding, with more emphasis on latency, power, and cost. In fact, AMD recently said that one of the largest AI model companies is using its chips for a significant portion of its daily inference traffic. That's important because the AI inference market is expected to become much larger than training over time. Even if AMD is only able to take some moderate market share away from Nvidia, given the size and growth of this market, it would still be meaningful. At the same time, AMD has become a leader in data centercentral processing units (CPUs), where it's steadily gaining share. While not as large of a market as GPUs, this is still a strong and growing part of the AI infrastructure build-out. The biggest risk for AMD is that it will always play second fiddle to Nvidia, or that AI infrastructure spending slows. But if inference spending takes off and AMD can grab some share, its stock should have a lot of upsides from here. Another beneficiary of the AI infrastructure boom isTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(TSM-2.62%), or TSMC. As the world's leading semiconductor contract manufacturer, TSMC is the company that actually makes advanced chips, such as GPUs. Profitably producing advanced chips at scale isn't easy. It requires cutting-edge technology, high utilization, and precision manufacturing. For its part, TSMC has become the leader in advanced nodes and packaging, which is the manufacturing process that allows more transistors to fit on a chip, making them both more powerful and energy efficient. With rivalsIntelandSamsungstruggling, TSMC has become the go-to partner for top chip designers. This has given the company strong pricing power and made it an integral part of the semiconductor supply chain. TSMC is currently working closely with its largest customers to expand capacity to keep up with the high demand for AI chips. The biggest risk is a slowdown in AI infrastructure spending, which could hit both revenue and fab utilization. But given how tight advanced-node capacity is today, that risk seems manageable. For long-term investors, TSMC looks like a great way to play the continued growth of AI and advanced semiconductors. WhileAlphabet(GOOGL-1.03%)(GOOG-1.11%)continues to face questions about whether AI will disrupt its dominant search business, the reality is far more nuanced. Yes,Applerecently claimed Google searches through its Safari browser fell for the first time, but that came during an antitrust trial, where Apple had every incentive to downplay Google's strength. Meanwhile, Alphabet said its search queries continue to grow, with Q1 search revenue climbing 10%. More importantly, Alphabet is adapting, which is what all great technology companies eventually have to do. Its new AI-powered search tools are focused on monetizing commercial queries, which has always been its bread and butter. Features like Shop by AI and virtual try-ons aren't gimmicks; they're smart moves to capture purchase intent in an AI world. Meanwhile, with decades of adtech experience and a massive distribution advantage through Android and Chrome, Alphabet is still in the driver's seat. Beyond search, Alphabet is seeing strong growth in itscloud computingbusiness, Google Cloud, as customers build AI models and apps through its Vertex AI platform and run them on its data center infrastructure. In addition, the company has also taken the lead in autonomous driving through its Waymo robotaxi business, which is expanding quickly throughout the U.S. This is a compelling long-term opportunity not priced into the stock. Risks remain around government regulation and AI competition, but with aforward P/Eof less than 19 times, the stock is dirt cheap for a company with so many growth levers.",

        "header": "Microsoft Hits an All-Time High. Here's Why These 2 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks Could Be Next.",
        "content": "Microsoft(MSFT-0.16%)hit a new all-time high early on Wednesday -- making it the only company at the moment valued at a market cap over $3.5 trillion. Investors wondering which \"Magnificent Seven\" stock could be next to have come to the right place. Here's the case for whyMeta Platforms(META-0.15%)andNvidia(NVDA-1.25%)could follow in Microsoft's footsteps and soon hit all-time highs, and why both stocks are worth buying now. Image source: Getty Images. The simplest reason why Meta and Nvidia could quickly follow Microsoft andhit all-time highsis because both stocks are the next-closest Magnificent Seven members to their all-time highs.  Data byYCharts. Meta and Nvidia may be close to making new highs, but it's a mistake to buy a stock just to make a quick profit. A better approach is to invest with a long-term mindset, and Microsoft, Meta, and Nvidia have the qualities necessary to be excellent investments for years to come. Microsoft, Meta, and Nvidia may operate in different industries, but they have many similarities as businesses. All three companies have done a masterful job carving out high-margin operations in competitive, growing industries. Microsoft has transformed its business from legacy software and hardware to the No. 2 cloud computing player behindAmazonWeb Services (AWS). It has also leveraged artificial intelligence (AI) across its operations toboost efficiency and grow profit margins. Instagram became such a prevalent social media app that Facebook changed its name to Meta Platforms to showcase the company'sFamily of Appsand virtual and augmented reality investments. Instagram has undergone a makeover from a stagnant, gallery-like interface centered around images to a dynamic platform with videos and an engaged community tailor-made for viral content. Instagram has helped Meta expand its revenue and margins and stay highly competitive with other short-form video options, like TikTok. It wasn't long ago that Nvidia heavily depended on its graphics segment, which includes sales for gaming, PCs, visualization, and software for internet applications. But now, the company's compute and networking segment makes up the vast majority of operating income and is the company's main growth driver, as customers demand supercomputing platforms that can handle increasingly complex and large data sets and simulations. In Nvidia's latest quarter, which was the three months ended April 27, compute and networking brought in $39.6 billion in revenue and $22.1 billion in operating income, compared to $4.5 billion in revenue for graphics and $1.6 billion in operating income. For context, Nvidia's compute and networking for the same quarter just one year ago was $22.7 billion and $17.1 billion in operating income -- illustrating the segment'sbreakneck growth rate. In sum, Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and Nvidia have undergone considerable transformations in recent years. Newer business segments are arguably the most valuable part of each company -- cloud for Microsoft, Instagram for Meta, and sales for data centers for Nvidia. When a company evolves, it can take the market time to properly value the new business. Microsoft, Meta, and Nvidia crushed theS&P 500(^GSPC-0.64%)over the last five to 10 years, especially Meta and Nvidia. And yet, because all three companies are growing profits from their legacy business segments and new markets, their valuations are still reasonable. Microsoft and Meta both have slightly higherprice-to-earnings (P/E) ratiosthan their five-year median levels. Nvidia's P/E ratio is down considerably since the companywasn't as profitable a few years ago.  Data byYCharts. As you can see in the chart above, expectations for Microsoft and Meta's forward earnings are fairly bleak, since their P/E ratios are just a little higher than their forward P/Es, suggesting low earnings growth. Meanwhile, Nvidia is still expected to grow quickly (but not as quickly as in the last few years), so its forward P/E is a lot less than its present P/E. Still, all three stocks may look expensive at first glance compared to the S&P 500, which has a forward P/E of just 21.7. But given the industry-leading positions of all three companies in rapidly growing industries, their valuations are arguably justified, especially relative to other hot stocks. Walmart(WMT-0.21%)andCostco Wholesale(COST-0.29%)-- the two most valuable companies in the consumer staples sector -- trade up 139% and 115%, respectively, over the last three years compared to a 46% gain in the S&P 500. But they haven't backed up those gains with considerable earnings growth -- leading to avaluation expansionfor both stocks. Walmart has a sky-high P/E ratio of 41.6, and Costco is even more expensive, at 57 times earnings. In an era when investors pay a premium price for high-quality companies across stock market sectors, Microsoft, Meta, and Nvidia aren't that expensive compared to many other names. Another similarity between Microsoft, Meta, and Nvidia is that all three companies have impeccable balance sheets. Microsoft finished its latest quarter with $79.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, compared to just $39.9 billion in long-term debt. In its latest quarter, Meta reported $70.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, compared to just $28.8 billion in long-term debt. Nvidia had $53.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, compared to just $8.5 billion in long-term debt on its balance sheet in its latest quarter. Each company has at least twice as much cash, cash equivalents, and investments as long-term debt, providing an elite level of financial health. Having a strong balance sheet can come in clutch during an economic downturn, a slowdown in a key end market, or a compelling acquisition opportunity. Microsoft, Meta, and Nvidia are ultra-elite Magnificent Seven companies due to their established and legacy business units, opportunities in newer industries, reasonable valuations, and balance sheet strengths. There are the kinds of businesses investors can be confidentbuying and holdingover a period of at least three to five years. It's never easy buying a stock near an all-time high. But if a company continues boosting its earnings year after year, it can grow into its valuation. This concept is why it's better for long-term investors to focus on quality companies than trying to get a weak business for an inexpensive price. Or, as Warren Buffettfamously said, \"It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.\" I'd say that Microsoft, Meta, and Nvidia are three wonderful companies at fair prices, making them great candidates for investors to load up on in June.",

        "content": "Chicago, IL \u2013 June 13, 2025 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include:\u00a0NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, D-Wave Quantum Inc. QBTS, IonQ, Inc. IONQ, Defiance Quantum ETF QTUM and Lockheed Martin Corp. LMT. Here are highlights from Thursday\u2019s Analyst Blog: NVIDIA Corp.'s CEO, Jensen Huang, recently shifted his stance on quantum computing, displaying hopefulness. Why is his buoyancy about quantum computing worth noting, and should investors think about buyingD-Wave Quantum Inc.andIonQ, Inc.stocks? Let's see \u2013 On Wednesday, Jensen Huang said, \"quantum computing is reaching an inflection point\". He sounded more bullish about the future of quantum computing and expects the new technology to address real-world issues in the near term. Huang is impressed with the quantum computing industry and highlighted NVIDIA's chip support. He added that NVIDIA would accelerate its quantum algorithm stack on the Grace Blackwell 200 chip (read more: Is NVIDIA's Rise in Value a Sign to Invest in NVDA Stock?). Huang's recent positive comments on quantum computing were well received, especially after his earlier pessimistic prediction of a 15 to 20-year timeline for realizing the full impact of quantum computing. Quantum computing employs \"qubits\" to handle substantial amounts of data across disciplines such as science, medicine and finance. Quantum computing is an emerging field that harnesses quantum mechanics for efficient problem-solving, with McKinsey predicting a $2 trillion market growth by 2035. The growth will be mainly fueled by quantum computing applications in pharmaceutical and material science advancements. Quantum computing stocks have been gaining this year, withDefiance Quantum ETF(QTUM) advancing 9.9% this year, outperforming the S&P 500's 1.1% gain. In reality, Huang's bullish comments about the emerging technology helped shares of some quantum computing stocks soar to their highest level on Wednesday. Investors are attracted to Huang's optimistic view on quantum computing and its rising popularity. However, quantum computing is still in its nascent stages; therefore, investing in related stocks requires careful consideration. We recommend two enticing stock picks for special attention. First on the list is D-Wave Quantum. The company posted blowout first-quarter results, with revenues coming in at $15 million, up a staggering 509% year over year. D-Wave Quantum was able to sell its cutting-edge Advantage2 quantum system to the J\u00fclich Supercomputer Center in Germany. The company ended the quarter with $304.3 million in cash, which means the company is well-funded to bear its operational costs. D-Wave Quantum met customer obligations and reduced liabilities by excelling in real-world applications due to its quantum annealing approach over gate-based computing. Interest in D-Wave's technology has helped the company expand its customer base, which includes the likes ofLockheed Martin Corp.(read more: Here's Why D-Wave Stock Promises High Growth and Is a Buy). The second is IonQ. The company's ion trap architecture offers scalability and a competitive advantage, which may help it reach profitability soon. In the first quarter, IonQ reduced its non-GAAP loss per share to $0.14 from $0.19 a year earlier. Most importantly, the company has posted revenues of $7.6 million in the quarter and expects 2025 revenues of $75-$95 million after acquiring Lightsynq. Its latest acquisition of UK-based quantum computing firm Oxford Ionics has also bolstered its business position. IonQ's unique linear ion chains enable it to surpass 100 qubits, expand its customer base, and reduce errors in quantum computing compared to its competitors (read more: Is IonQ a Better Quantum Computing Stock to Buy Than D-Wave?). Both D-Wave Quantum and IonQ have a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The expected earnings growth rate for D-Wave Quantum and IonQ is 72% and 69.9%, respectively, for the current year.

        "header": "Want Exposure to Nvidia, Microsoft, and Tesla? This New ETF Covers Them All.",
        "content": "Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are a great way to gain exposure to the hot field of artificial intelligence (AI). ETFs provide a diversified portfolio of AI stocks while typically charging low fees. A new AI ETF emerged recently, and what makes this one stand out is that it's overseen by Dan Ives, the global head of technology research at Wall Street firm Wedbush Fund Advisors. Naturally, the fund, theDan Ives Wedbush AI Revolution ETF(IVES-1.60%), is named after its founder. But just because it sports the name of a well-known stock market analyst doesn't mean the ETF is a buy. Here's a deeper look into this new opportunity to invest in the hot field of artificial intelligence. Image source: Getty Images. Ives started his namesake ETF because he's excited about the transformative power artificial intelligence brings to every industry. He told Fox Business, \"In 25 years covering tech, I've never seen a bigger theme than the AI revolution.\" The fund is made up of 30 businesses across a number of industries ranging from semiconductor manufacturing and robotics to cybersecurity and consumer products. What ties these disparate companies together is that each has developed strong AI capabilities in their fields. The Dan Ives Wedbush AI Revolution ETF encompasses many key players in the AI space, including tech stalwartsMicrosoft,Tesla,Apple,Palo Alto Networks, and of course, AI darlingNvidia. Some newcomers to the AI arena are also included, such asSoundHound AIandC3.ai. All 30 stocks were handpicked using Ives' proprietary investment framework. Ives intends to actively manage the roster of companies in his ETF, and the plan is to reconfigure and rebalance the stocks quarterly. At the time of this writing, Microsoft has the heaviest weighting in the ETF at 5.65%. Ives described this process to CNBC, saying: It's based on our research. So as new companies come in, then some companies could come out. This is a living organism, in terms of this AI 30. It's not static. And that's a key part of the theme here, because the theme will continue to evolve. While available to all investors, the ETF is aimed atretail investors. Ives explained there's \"a heavy focus on retail for all the investors that follow me.\" The Dan Ives Wedbush AI Revolution ETF charges an annual fee of 0.75%, which is higher than several otherAI ETFs. That's not surprising because the fund is actively managed, so investors will be paying $75 annually in fees for every $10,000 invested. In fact, Cullen Rogers, chief investment officer at Wedbush Fund Advisers, told CNBC, \"We're kind of walking this line between active and passive.\" This is actually a strength of Ives' ETF compared to a passively managed fund. The AI industry is dynamic and evolving rapidly. Having Ives and his team researching and staying on top of who the important AI players are across diverse industries is essential to the fund's performance over time. And Ives wasn't modest when he highlighted another reason to invest in his ETF, telling Yahoo! Finance, \"There is only one Dan Ives.\" He elaborated, \"There are plenty of other great vehicles out there, but there's only one that encompasses my investing team and the research that investors have trusted me to deliver.\" Is there enough reason to invest in the Dan Ives Wedbush AI Revolution ETF? It boasts a number of exceptional AI stocks. For example, it includes shares of Facebook parentMeta Platforms, which rose 42%, andPegasystems, which skyrocketed 78% over the past 12 months. But because the fund is so new, with an inception date of June 3, the ETF lacks a track record to assess how it's performed over time. Some of the veteran companies in the fund, for example, Nvidia, are a solid choice, but others, such as Soundhound, are newer businesses that may not succeed over the long run. So there's risk this ETF can underperform the overall market. If so, you're better off opting forone of the ETFsfocused on theS&P 500. Moreover, the method Ives is taking with his fund warrants careful consideration. He told Yahoo! Finance: \"I've never been too focused on valuations. It's about the themes, the best places, and the disruptors.\" To saystock valuationis taking a bit of a back seat is concerning. It's also counter to how investing legend Warren Buffett approaches stocks. As Buffett has famously said, \"It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.\" As a result, before deciding to invest, wait to see how the ETF performs over the next few quarters.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you cansign upto receive in your inbox every morning along with: The chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings Nearly halfway through 2025, it's clear the stock market has a different character than in the past two years, in which it seemed the same story played out twice. In 2023 and 2024, investorschampioned the rise of the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks, leading to a historically low number of S&P 500 (^GSPC) constituents outperforming the broader index. This year, things are looking more normal relative to market history. Through June 11, roughly 46% of companies in the benchmark index were sitting on year-to-date gains that topped the S&P 500's 2.6% gain. Richard Bernstein Advisors CEO Richard Bernstein said in an interview this week that all investors should hope the broadening continues, because it means \"the health of the broader economy is improving.\" Across the S&P 500's 11 sectors, seven have outperformed the index this year, led by a more than 9% rise for Industrials (XLI) and a 7% pop for Utilities (XLU). The Magnificent Seven tech stockshave contributed significantly to the market's most recent leg higher in the past month. But zoom out to the full year, and the cohort is a clear laggard. Research from Exhibit A co-founder Matt Cerminaronotes that as of June 11, the Magnificent Seven index, which includes Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL,GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA), has fallen 2.51% in 2025. By comparison, the other 493 stocks in the S&P 500 have risen 5.32%. Aswe highlighted late last month, the current market backdrop has grown more favorable for stock pickers, with stocks beginning to move on their own accord \u2014rather than in a large group depending on the president's Truth Social posts\u2014 as peak tariff uncertainty subsides. AIremains a key theme for investorsin that environment, but not all of this year's biggest winners are tied to this transformative technology, another break from years past. AI and defense darling Palantir (PLTR) is the year's biggest winner in the index, rising 80%. But the balance of the top 10 best-performing stocks flaunts a more diverse group, featuring energy names like NRG Energy (NRG), gold plays like Newmont (NEM), and discount retailer Dollar General (DG). And while companies like GE Vernova (GEV) and CVS (CVS) might not light up the conversation at a cocktail party, Bernstein notes that this broader participation is likely a good sign for markets moving forward. \"I have a very tough time understanding why people think it's great that seven stocks are dominating the world,\" Bernstein said. \"I don't get that.

        "content": "Warren Buffett is the CEO of theBerkshire Hathawayholding company, where he oversees a number of wholly owned subsidiaries and a $281 billion portfolio of publicly traded stocks and securities. He plans to step down at the end of 2025, capping off a stellar run of success that dates back to 1965. Had you invested $1,000 in Berkshire stock when Buffett took the helm 60 years ago, you would have been sitting on a whopping $44.7 million at the end of 2024. But he's a seasoned expert who knows exactly what to look for when he's buying stocks, so the average retail investor might struggle to replicate his returns. Therefore, Buffett often recommends buying low-cost exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track indexes like theS&P 500(^GSPC0.38%). TheVanguard S&P 500 ETF(VOO0.31%)is one he's suggested by name in the past, and it's one of the most cost-effective options. The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF tracks the S&P 500 by investing in exactly the same companies, and if history is any guide, it could turn $500 per month into $1 million over the long term. Here's how. Image source: The Motley Fool. TheS&P 500is made up of 500 different companies, and they have to meet strict criteria to be included. Each company must have amarket capitalizationof at least $20.5 billion, and the sum of their earnings (profits) must be positive over the most recent four quarters. But even after ticking every box, a special committee has the final say over which companies make the cut. The 500 companies in the S&P 500 come from 11 different sectors of the economy. Some sectors have a higher representation than others because the index is weighted by market capitalization, which means the largest companies have a greater influence over its performance than the smallest. That's why the information technology sector has a massive weighting of 30.4%. It's home to the world's three largest companies --Microsoft,Nvidia, andApple, which have a combined market cap of $10 trillion. The table below breaks down the top five sectors in the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF, their weightings, and some of the popular stocks within them: Sector Vanguard ETF Portfolio Weighting Popular Stocks Information Technology 30.4% Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple. Financials 14.4% Berkshire Hathaway,JP Morgan Chase, andVisa. Healthcare 10.8% Eli Lilly,Johnson & Johnson, andPfizer. Consumer Discretionary 10.4% Amazon,Tesla, andMcDonald's. Communication Services 9.3% Alphabet,Meta Platforms, andNetflix. Data source: Vanguard. Portfolio weightings are accurate as of April 30 and are subject to change. Artificial intelligence(AI) is a dominant theme in the stock market right now because it's impacting almost every sector of the S&P, especially information technology, thanks to companies likeNvidiaand Microsoft. But Amazon,Tesla, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and even Netflix are using AI in unique ways to supercharge their various businesses. But diversification is the main reason the S&P 500 is the most widely followed U.S. stock market index. Per the above table, the financial and healthcare sectors make up a combined 25% of the S&P, and the index also offers investors exposure to the industrial, energy, and even real estate sectors. As I mentioned earlier, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF is one of the cheapest ways to invest in the benchmark index. It features anexpense ratioof just 0.03%, meaning an investment of $10,000 will incur an annual fee of just $3. Vanguard says the average expense ratio of similar ETFs across the industry is a whopping 25 times higher at 0.75%, which can detract from investors' returns over the long run. The S&P 500 plunged by 19% from its record high earlier this year on the back of simmering global trade tensions that were triggered by President Trump'stariffs. But volatility is a normal part of the investing journey because the index suffers a decline of 10% or more every two and a half years, on average, and investors can expect abear marketdecline of 20% every six years or so (according to Capital Group). But even after accounting for every sell-off, correction, and bear market, the S&P 500 has delivered a compound annual return of 10.3% (includingdividends) since it was established in 1957. Based on that return, investors who deploy $500 per month into theVanguard S&P 500 ETFcould join the millionaires' club within 30 years: Monthly Investment Balance After 10 Years Balance After 20 Years Balance After 30 Years $500 $105,595 $398,682 $1,216,040 Calculations by author. Past performance isn't a reliable indicator of future results, so there is no guarantee the S&P will continue to deliver annual returns of 10.3%. But forces like AI could add trillions of dollars in market cap to some of the most influential companies in the index, which would support further gains. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang predicts AI data center spending will reach $1 trillionper yearby 2028, which is great news for his company andevery other semiconductor stockin the S&P. Then there are AI subsegments likeautonomous drivingand robotics, which could be trillion-dollar opportunities on their own. But even if it takes a little longer than 30 years to turn $500 per month into $1 million, the S&P 500 is still likely to be significantly higher by then, so investors who start their investing journey today will almost certainly be better off than those who remain on the sidelines.",

        "content": "By Max A. Cherney SAN JOSE (Reuters) -Advanced Micro Devices has forged close ties to a batch ofartificial intelligencestartups as part of the company's effort to bolster its software and forge superior chip designs. As AI companies seek alternatives to Nvidia's chips, AMD has begun to expand its plans to build a viable competing line of hardware, acquiring companies such as server maker ZT Systems in its quest to achieve that goal. But to build a successful line of chips also requires a powerful set of software to efficiently run the programs built by AI developers. AMD has acquired several small software companies in recent weeks in a bid to boost its talent, and it has been working to beef up its set of software, broadly known as ROCm. \"This will be a very thoughtful, deliberate, multi-generational journey for us,\" said Vamsi Boppana, senior vice president of AI at AMD. AMD has committed to improve its ROCm and other software, which is a boon to customers such as AI enterprise startup Cohere, as it results in speedy changes and the addition of new features. Cohere is focused on building AI models that are tailored for large businesses versus the foundational AI models that companies likeOpenAIand others target. AMD has made important strides in improving its software, Cohere CEO Aidan Gomez said in an interview with Reuters. Changing Cohere's software to run on AMD chips was a process that previously took weeks and now happens in only \"days,\" Gomez said. Gomez declined to disclose exactly how much of Cohere's software relies on AMD chips but called it a \"meaningful segment of our compute base\" around the world. OPENAI INFLUENCE OpenAI has had significant influence on the design of the forthcoming MI450 series of AI chips, said Forrest Norrod, an executive vice president at AMD. AMD's MI400 series of chips will be the basis for a new server called \"Helios\" that the company plans to release next year. Nvidia too has engineered whole servers in part because AI computations require hundreds or thousands of chips strung together. OpenAI's Sam Altman appeared on stage at AMD's Thursday event in San Jose, and discussed the partnership between the two companies in broad terms. Norrod said that OpenAI's requests had a big influence on how AMD designed the MI450 series memory architecture and how the hardware can scale up to thousands of chips necessary to build and run AI applications. The ChatGPT creator also influenced what kinds of mathematical operations the chips are optimized for. \"(OpenAI) has given us a lot of feedback that, I think, heavily informed our design,\" Norrod said.

        "content": "The U.S. equity market bounced back impressively from the turbulence caused by April's tariff shocks. With strong earnings performance and easing geopolitical tensions, investors are again looking out for the next technology winner. Nvidia(NVDA1.45%)had a phenomenal run in the past few years, riding high on GPU demand. However, there is one stock that is also building a bigger moat. Image source: Getty Images. MeetMicrosoft(MSFT1.22%), a global technology giant that has embeddedartificial intelligence(AI) into every layer of its ecosystem. Although Nvidia and Microsoft are currently challenging each other to become the world's most valuable company, the latter's approach can enable it to surpass Nvidia significantly by next year. Here's why. Nvidia primarily focuses on developing the hardware and software infrastructure needed to drive the ongoing AI revolution. In contrast, Microsoft has built a strong presence across both the AI infrastructure and AI application markets. Microsoft is leveraging AI technologies to increase performance and lower costs across the entire technology stack, including data center design, hardware, system software, and model optimization. Subsequently, the company managed to monetize its AI technologies through several avenues -- from direct use, such as Copilot virtual assistants across applications like Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, and GitHub, to indirect use through third-party applications built using its Azure AI services. Microsoft is also scaling up its AI infrastructure rapidly and released the Phi family of small language models (38 million downloads) and BitNet b1.58, which runs on CPUs. This reduced the company's dependency on GPUs, which can help lower costs and broaden AI accessibility. Microsoft tools and platforms such as GitHub, Visual Studio Code, and Power Platform are increasingly used by developers to build AI applications. This is creating a strong network effect, as the value of these offerings rapidly increases with new insights provided by the existing developer base, attracting even more developers. Microsoft has also processed over 100 trillion tokens (such as ID tokens, access tokens, or refresh tokens, which are used for user authentication) in the third quarter, a fivefold increase on a year-over-year basis. This massive scale has given the company a strong data advantage in operational and optimization insights, which hardware players cannot replicate. Third-quarter fiscal 2025 results highlight the success of management's AI strategy. Azure and other cloud services revenue rose 33% year over year, with AI services contributing 16 percentage points to that growth. The company also reported a threefold increase in Microsoft 365 Copilot use and a fourfold increase in GitHub Copilot use on a year-over-year basis. Enterprise customers extensively used Microsoft's business productivity products over the past decade. Since these products are deeply embedded in the company's infrastructure, clients find it challenging to switch to competitors. This enterprise software is seeing even better customer retention rates and recurring revenue with AI integration. Furthermore, the company's long-term enterprise relationships also provide cross-selling and distribution opportunities, an advantage that pure-play AI companies are unable to replicate. Currently, more than 230,000 organizations, including 90% of companies that make up the Fortune 500, use the company's virtual assistant, Copilot. Unlike Nvidia's GPU sales, which are one-time transactions, Microsoft's AI services generate recurring revenue streams. And companies opt to delay GPU purchases in a tighter economy but are less likely to eliminate mission-critical software that runs their daily operations. Microsoft generates revenue from a diverse range of sources, including cloud computing infrastructure, a suite of productivity applications, gaming, and advertising. This has significantly reduced the company's business concentration risk stemming from overreliance on a single or a few markets. All these strategies have led to exceptional revenue visibility. The company ended the third quarter with commercial remaining performance obligations (RPOs) of $315 billion, representing a 34% year-over-year increase. And Microsoft's 98% annuity revenue model offers more predictable cash flows compared to Nvidia's bulk GPU sales, which are highly dependent on semiconductor cycles and ongoing AI infrastructure build-outs. Nvidia's investment case becomes even riskier when we consider the increasing competition from companies such asAdvanced Micro Devices,Intel, and hyperscalers developing in-house chips. As the costs of AI inference workloads rise, more clients will prefer to shift workloads from costlier GPUs to less expensive CPUs  or seek software services that can postpone the obsolescence of existing GPUs. Plus, increased export restrictions on Nvidia's GPU sales to China and other international markets also pose a significant headwind. This can hurt the chipmaker's top line in the coming years. Microsoft currently trades at 26.2 times forward earnings, which is lower than its five-year average of 33.2. Despite this, the valuation is at a premium, especially for a company that is not only in AI but is also a major software company. Hence, some investors may be uncomfortable paying premium AI valuations for traditional software businesses. But AI is gradually transforming every aspect of Microsoft's business. The company's financial results continue to be impressive despite significant investments in AI infrastructure. In the third quarter, Microsoft's operating margins rose 1 percentage point year over year to 46% , while cash flow from operations surged 16% year over year to $37 billion. The company also maintains a cash and investments balance of $79.6 billion, which ensures strong financial flexibility. Lastly, management remains committed to returning value to shareholders, as evidenced by the $9.7 billion paid in dividends and share repurchases, a 15% increase year over year. Against this backdrop, it does seem pretty plausible for the company to definitively emerge as the most valuable AI stock in 2026. This may be a smart time to buy at least a small stake in Microsoft.",

        "content": "Shares of RH (RH) soared 20% in premarket trading Friday, a day after the high-end home furnishings retailer posted a surprise profit and announced steps to offset the effects of new tariffs. The company formerly known as Restoration Hardware reported first-quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.13, while analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha were looking for an adjusted loss of $0.07 per share. Revenue jumped 12% year-over-year to $814.0 million, slightly below estimates. CEO Gary Friedman wrote in a letter to shareholders that RH was especially pleased with its performance in England and the rest of Europe. Friedman also said that the company was maintaining its full-year guidance despite \"the speculative and uncertain outcome related to tariffs and the macroeconomic environment,\" including a weak housing market. Friedman explained that in response, RH was \"delaying the launch of the new concept that was planned for the second half of 2025 to the Spring of 2026 when there is more certainty regarding tariffs.\" In addition, the company will continue to shift sourcing out of China, and \"resourced a significant portion of our upholstered furniture to our own North Carolina factory.\" Friedman noted that because the tariffs have disrupted global shipments and resourcing, it is reducing its revenue outlook by 6 percentage points in the current quarter. However, the company anticipates making that up in the second half of the year. RH sees 2025 revenue up 10% to 13%. Shares of RH have lost more than half their value this year entering Friday trading. TradingView",

        "content": "AMD (AMD,Financials)officially launched its Instinct MI355X GPU acceleratorWednesday, showcasing a massive leap in compute power and energy demands as it competes with Nvidia's Blackwell Ultra B300. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with AMD. The MI355X is part of AMD's new CDNA 4 architecture and is optimized for AI inference. With support for FP4, FP6, FP8, and FP16 precision, the MI355X delivers up to 20.1 PFLOPS in FP4/FP6 workloads and 10.1 PFLOPS in FP8, slightly ahead of Nvidia's B300 at 15 FP4 PFLOPS. To support this performance, the MI355X consumes 1,400W peak, nearly doubling the 750W required by its predecessor, the MI300X. AMD expects some users may still air-cool the chip, but liquid cooling is the standard. The GPU includes 288 GB of HBM3E memory with bandwidth reaching 8 TB/s. A scaled 8-way configuration brings system-level performance to 161 PFLOPS (FP4) and 80.5 PFLOPS. While raw compute marks a win on paper, AMD still trails Nvidia in deployment scale and software ecosystem. Pegatron is reportedly preparing a 128-way MI350X system, but Nvidia remains dominant in large-scale AI training clusters. AMD's Chief Technology Officer Mark Papermaster said zettascale supercomputing by 2035 will require processors consuming up to 2,000W each.

His remarks came during CNBC's VivaTech conference coverage in Paris. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. Huang warned that by restricting AI chip sales to China, the U.S. may accelerate China's move to develop a separate technology stack. Huawei, he said, is already in position to cover China and much of the rest of the world if U.S. companies exit the market. If the United States doesn't want to partake in China, Huawei has got China covered, and Huawei has got everybody else covered, Huang told CNBC. While emphasizing that Nvidia's technology remains a generation ahead, Huang cautioned that allowing China to retain most of the world's AI developers could shift global momentum. If all the AI developers are in China, [the] China stack is going to win, he said. The comments come amid escalating U.S.China tech tensions. The Biden administrationnow succeeded by President Donald Trumppreviously moved to revoke student visas and warned against using Chinese chips.

        "content": "IPO activity post-pandemic has fluctuated significantly, primarily driven by economic uncertainty, rising interest rates, and inflation, all of which have impacted investor sentiment. But the tide has shifted positively over the past year, with several notable IPOs hitting the market, including CoreWeave CRWV and Circle Internet Group CRCL. Both stocks have seen big runs in June. In short, CRWV provides exposure to the AI frenzy, whereas CRCL is a play on the mainstreaming of digital dollars and the evolving stablecoin regulatory landscape. Let\u2019s take a closer glance at each. Given its backing by AI-favorite NVIDIA NVDA, the IPO reflected one of the most exciting we\u2019ve seen in years. An SEC filing in late May 2025 revealed NVIDIA has a $900 million stake, reflecting one of its largest investors. It\u2019s also important to know that NVIDIA supplies CoreWeave with most of its high-performance GPUs that power CRWV\u2019s AI infrastructure. Some time back, investors raised flags concerning the massive amount of sales NVIDIA generated from CRWV, but that concern has since evaporated. The company\u2019s latest set of quarterly results were driven by accelerating demand for its AI offerings, with sales up a staggering 420% year-over-year. Revenue backlog totaled a strong $25.9 billion, with CRWV also securing more lucrative deals with enterprises. Up 270% since its IPO, the stock remains a great play on the AI frenzy, which appears to still be in the early innings. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Circle is a global financial technology firm that enables businesses of all sizes to harness the power of digital currencies and public blockchains for payments, commerce, and financial applications worldwide. It\u2019s the issuer of USDC, the world\u2019s second-largest dollar-pegged stablecoin, widely used across exchanges, DeFi platforms, and institutional trading venues. But what does that even mean? CEO Jeremy Allaire explains simply \u2013 \u2018If you could take what we think of as money, make it digital and available on the internet, then that would dramatically change the way we use money and open up opportunity around the world. That\u2019s the idea behind Circle.\u2019 Below is an image displaying the company\u2019s platform in greater detail. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Since their debut on June 5th, shares have went on a massive run. It\u2019s worth noting that Cathie Wood\u2019s ARK had a big win on the stock, purchasing roughly 4.5 million shares on its first day of trading. The stock overall reflects a great play on the evolving stablecoin regulatory landscape, which is also just seemingly beginning as we increasingly wade into the digital age. Bottom Line IPO news has dominated headlines this week, a nice breather from tariffs news that have consistently impacted sentiment. Circle CRCL shares have been blistering hot since their debut this month, with CoreWeave CRWV shares also seeing similar price action since its debut.

        "content": "Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)launches its new M1350 semiconductor, positioned to rival Nvidia's (NVDA) Blackwell line of AI chips. Shares of Chime Financial (CHYM) are stumbling Friday morning, its first full trading day since making its public debut via an IPO on Thursday. Catch Yahoo Finance'sfull interview with Chime CFO Matt Newcomb, where he discusses what separates fintech companies from banks. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Wealthhere. Now time for some of today's trending tickers. We're watching AMD and Chime, and joining me now is Market Domination co-host, Julie Hyman. So first up here, we're looking at AMD. It's aiming to rival Nvidia's Blackwell AI chips. The company launching its new M1350 and detailing its next generation M1400 GPUs at its advancing AI event in San Jose, California on Thursday. AMD also showing off its new AMD developer cloud, which allows users to log into its platform to quickly gain cloud access to its line of GPUs here. So AMD does say that the processors offer up to four times the AI compute versus its prior next-gen chips. Again, designed to go head ahead with Nvidia. We'll see how these chip wars continue to develop here. Shares are down right now across the broader market, though, too. Yeah, and, you know, yes, and they fell a little bit yesterday even as they were making some of these announcements late in the session, and then continuing that decline today. You know, this has been going on ever since Nvidia really started asserting its dominance. You've had these other chip makers come out and say, \"Oh, we're making this newer, even faster chip.\" But does it bear out in the marketplace? We haven't really seen that yet, right? We still see most of the dollars flowing to Nvidia, and some of the dollars that aren't flowing to Nvidia are falling to Broadcom because companies are getting those custom chips. So, you know, yes, AMD has some market share, um, and maybe the market will be so large going forward that they'll get more, but, you know, I guess what I'm saying is these announcements don't necessarily always have a big impact. We're going to have to see how it flows through the through the numbers. AMD, by the way, has really been underperforming. The stock is off like 28% over the past year. Most analysts still like it overwhelmingly, in fact, um, but you know, even this year, it's it's down about 4%. Yeah, you bring up a good point, too, which is the sheer size of AMD relative to Nvidia. It's just such a smaller company. So we'll continue to watch those developments too. But moving on to Chime, shares are falling to start its first full day of trading. The stock closed higher by over 30% on Thursday, the latest in a series of IPOs that soared after their debuts last year. I actually got a chance to speak with Chime CFO, Matt Newcome, about how the company is positioned within this volatile market environment and where he's seeing strength right now. Take a listen. Our payments business is very concentrated in non-discretionary spend, and that tends to be resilience regardless of the macro cycle. And I think there's been a lot of headlines, uh, about, uh, you know, worries about the economy and macro. What we see is we see a resilient consumer, uh, spending, um, and a lot of behavior on our platform very much in line with what we would expect. So the resiliency of the US consumer, that stuck out to me here. We have seen sentiment data rebound recently, just this morning, consumer sentiment bouncing off those three-year lows. We'll see if that reverses depending on the headlines that we get out of Washington and like we saw today, the world. Uh, but we are at a time when digital banking, consumer facing fintech, that's becoming more and more popular. So I'm curious to see how Chime performs within this market, especially since the IPO landscape right now, it's been a little lukewarm. It has, although you know what's really interesting? I was looking at some Bloomberg data this morning, and the larger IPOs that come out this morning or this this year have done really well on the first day. The ones that are over $100 million, on average, have, uh, jumped about 25%. Now, that doesn't mean over the long term that they're going to do great, but it is it does show that there is an appetite out there in the markets for these new offerings and for these larger companies in particular. As you know, uh, the bankers keep hoping that this thing is going to crack open a little bit more. And with every incremental step of a company like Chime coming out and doing well, one would think that that would prime the pump a little bit more for for more of those types of offerings. Yeah, look at the Circle IPO. That did really, really well. Yeah. Exactly. And Chime right now is trading 34 bucks a share. Like we said, it's off, but it was priced at 27. So we're continuing to watch that space, Julie. Thank you so much. You can scan the QR below to track the best and worst performing stocks of the session with Yahoo Finance's trending tickers page.

        "content": "Easyrain has made a significant move by partnering withNVIDIAto advance its road detection technologies. Additionally, NVIDIA's ongoing investment in Skild AI reflects its interest in the burgeoning consumer robotics sector. Over the past quarter, NVIDIA's shares rose 19%, which coincides with notable corporate activities, including robust earnings growth and strategic alliances. Amidst a market impacted by geopolitical tensions, such as the Israel-Iran conflict, which affected broader indexes, NVIDIA's forward-looking initiatives and financial results likely lent weight to its upward trajectory, aligning closely with the tech sector's overall resilience in challenging times. We've identified 1 weakness for NVIDIA that you should be aware of. This technology could replace computers: discover the 24 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality. The partnership between Easyrain and NVIDIA creates a potential avenue for NVIDIA to integrate its AI and GPU technologies further into the automotive sector, aligning with the ongoing expansion into autonomous vehicles. This move could bolster revenue and earnings forecasts as NVIDIA taps into the growing demand for enhanced AI capabilities in automotive systems. Additionally, NVIDIA's collaboration with Skild AI and its share price increase of 19% over the past quarter underscore investor confidence fuelled by strategic alliances and earnings growth. Over the past five years, NVIDIA's shares have seen a very large total return of 1478.19%, reflecting strong performance driven by advancements across gaming, data center, and automotive sectors. In contrast, NVIDIA's one-year return closely matched the US market at 11.7%, while outperforming the semiconductor industry, which reported a 6.1% return. This exemplifies NVIDIA's ability to weather market shifts amid geopolitical tensions, demonstrating resilience in challenging industry landscapes. Currently, with a share price at US$113.54 and an analyst price target of approximately US$163.12, NVIDIA's stock trades at a notable discount of 30.4% below the target. This suggests that market participants might expect positive revisions to revenue and earnings forecasts as NVIDIA continues to expand its technological foothold in burgeoning AI markets. Such potential aligns with NVIDIA's Blackwell architecture and strategic partnerships, which might enhance its standing in high-margin areas and could support future share price appreciation toward the analyst consensus target.

        "content": "Nvidiais not including the Chinese market in its financial forecastsas a result of strict export controls hampering business with the country, CEO Jensen Huang told CNN on Thursday. Huang has repeatedly criticized the Trump administration\u2019s export restrictions as limiting U.S. manufacturing and growth opportunities. Export controls may loosen as a result of a trade deal with China in exchange for greater access to rare earths. AI chipmaker Nvidia will no longer include Chinese business in its financial forecasts after President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to tighten export controls to China. CEO Jensen Huangtold CNNon Thursday that a trade deal between the U.S. and China would be \u201ca great bonus,\u201d but he wasn\u2019t counting on that outcome. \u201cI\u2019ve told all of our investors and shareholders that, going forward, our forecasts will not include the China market,\u201d he said. The Department of Commerce last month initiated aseries of export controlsthat would revoke a Biden-era \u201cdiffusion\u201d rule capping the number of chips other countries are able to buy, while also \u201cwarning the public about the potential consequences of allowing U.S. AI chips to be used for training and interference of Chinese AI models.\u201d Weeks later, the administration reportedly restricted chip design software companies likeSynopsysandSiemensfrom selling to China without a U.S. government license,according to Bloomberg. While Huang touted the removal of the \u201cdiffusion\u201d rule as helping to bolster U.S. manufacturing, he\u2019s concerned the crackdown on trade with China will have the opposite effect. The export controls on China have had a tangible impact on Nvidia, which, despite reporting a blockbuster69% increase in quarterly revenue, missed out on $2.5 billion in revenue from being unable to ship its H20 chips to China, the company said. Nvidia\u2019sH20 chips, less powerful than their Blackwell counterparts, were designed specifically to comply with U.S. export controls on the country and resulted in a $4.5 billion charge due to excess inventory, still less than the $5.5 billion expected. Huang warned more broadly of the dangers of export controls. He doubled downon previous commentsthat rather than cutting China off from a burgeoning resource in U.S. semiconductor chips, the restrictions are actually spurring the country to jump-start its own development efforts. \u201cThe goals of the export controls are not being achieved,\u201d Huang told CNN. \u201cWhatever those goals are that were being discussed initially, [they] are apparently not working. And so I think, with all export controls, the goals have to be well-articulated and tested over time.\u201d The Department of Commerce did not immediately respond toFortune\u2019s request for comment. Nvidia declined to comment beyond Huang\u2019s remarks. While Huang won\u2019t want to hand Nvidia\u2019s business in China toHuawei\u201con a silver platter,\u201d according to Wedbush managing director Dan Ives, the CEO is also being strategic with investors by cutting China from Nvidia\u2019s profit and revenue forecasts. \u201cHe\u2019s 10% politician, 90% CEO,\u201d Ives toldFortune.\u201cHe needs to be cautious on their financial guidance, given the China variable.\u201d Ives, however, agreed with Huang that the export controls present a problem to the entire U.S. industry, arguing they would give an opportunity for China to catch up with U.S. development progress. Huawei CEO Ren Zhengfei told state media on Tuesday the China-produced chips areone generation behindNvidia\u2019s, but the company is finding workarounds to improve performance. \u201cThis is a work in progress,\u201d Ives said. \u201cFor the first time in 30 years, the U.S. is ahead of China when it comes to tech. You don\u2019t want to give China the opportunity to leapfrog the U.S. again.\u201d There\u2019s a big asterisk next to the state of export controls, however, as the U.S. and Chinafinalize a trade frameworkafter officials met in London earlier this week. As part of the trade deal, China may consider speeding up issuing rare-earths export licenses in exchange for lifted restrictions on technology to make semiconductor chips. \u201cIt does seem like some of the U.S. controls introduced in recent weeks, including on software for designing semiconductors, will be relaxed as part of the deal,\u201d Geoffrey Gertz, a Center for a New American Security fellow and former National Security Council official, said in aLinkedIn poston Wednesday. \u201cThe key point is that [the U.S. government] has now opened the door to negotiating away export controls, and so [China] (and others) will keep on pushing on this point,\u201d he added.

        "content": "Shares ofQuantum Computing(QUBT-4.74%)are surging this week, up 24.2% as of 1:22 p.m. ET. The jump comes as theS&P 500(^GSPC-1.13%)and theNasdaq Composite(^IXIC-1.30%)both had modest gains. At his company's GTC Paris developer conference on Wednesday,NvidiaCEO Jensen Huang indicated that he thinksquantum computingis reaching an \"inflection point,\" boosting stocks across the industry. Earlier this year, Huang sent quantum stocks sliding after he said he believes useful quantum computers were 15 years or more away. He later qualified his remarks and walked them back somewhat, even hosting executives from around the industry to \"tell him why he was wrong.\" On Wednesday, however, he went much further, making the most directly bullish comments thus far. Huang said that he believes the industry is nearing an \"inflection point\" and that \"we are within reach\" of being able to apply the technology \"in areas that can solve some interesting problems in the coming years.\" Image source: Getty Images. As much as this seems a significant departure from his original stance, it seems to me that investors may be reading past what Huang actually said. There's a difference between solving \"some interesting problems\" and the full maturation of quantum technology that delivers on its transformative promise. There is plenty of reason to believe Huang's original timeline for the latter. And given the enormous market capitalizations of these quantum stocks, including Quantum Computing, the technology must be transformative. I think we are still a very long way from a quantum computer that is robust, powerful, and stable enough to generate a return on the current level of investment. I would stay away from Quantum Computing stock for the time being.",

        "content": "Retail sales grew in May, according to a fresh analysis, but uncertainty is shifting consumer behavior, leaving retailers eager to pinpoint where it\u2019s headed. Core retail sales\u2014which excludes restaurant, car and gas spending\u2014rose about 0.2% from April to May, and 4.2% from a year earlier, the National Retail Federation said Friday.Spending growth has slowed, which the trade group said in part reflects fewer consumers stocking up on goods in an attempt to beat tariff-fueled price increases. \u201cWhile momentum remains, the nature of consumer spending is shifting as economic uncertainty increases,\u201d NRF President Matthew Shay said in a press release. \u201cConsumer fundamentals haven\u2019t been damaged yet, and a slowing-but-still-growing job market is supporting household priorities ahead of any meaningful price increases in the coming months.\u201d Spending on digital products, such as games and books, shot up about 28% year-over-year in May, and sporting goods sales rose 8.2%, the NRF said. But sales at building and garden supply stores fell 7.3% over the past year, it said. The federal government is slated to release its own retail sales figures for May on Tuesday. The University of Michigan\u2019s Index of Consumer Sentimentrose 16% from May to June\u2014marking the first increase in six months. Unease about the economy remains high by historical standards, but has come down as the White House has moderated its stance on tariffs. Under a proposed trade deal with China, President Donald Trump may keep tariffs on Chinese exports at the current level, rather than the prior 145% tax. The U.S.may also maintain 10% tariffson goods from a number of trading partners past July, when higher import taxes are slated to go into effect, officials said. A number of retailers are searching for signals on how consumers will respond to the latest twists in domestic trade policy. Shoppers have been relatively cautious, apparel companies J.Jill (JILL) and Oxford Industries (OXM) said on earnings conference calls this week. \u201cConcern about the impact of tariffson prices in the economy is exacerbating weak consumer sentiment,\u201d Oxford Industries CEO Thomas Caldecot Chubb III said, according to a transcript made available by AlphaSense. Assessments are complicated by the fact that Americans endured years of high inflation, beginning amid the pandemic, said Howard Friedman, CEO of Utz Brands (UTZ), which sells chips, pretzels and other snacks. \u201cThe consumer may be taking a little bit of a break,\u201d Friedman said at a conference this week.",

While the quantum computing sector experienced some good news this week, D-Wave also announced an at-the-market (ATM) stock offering to potentially raise new capital. D-Wave's ATM offering is with several brokerages and investment banks and will allow the company from time to time to conduct the \"issuance and sale\" of common stock for up to $400 million. The word issuance indicates that new shares could be offered to raise capital, which would bedilutive to existing shareholders. Image source: Getty Images. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission( SEC), D-Wave also said that cash balances on hand as of March 31 are enough \"to fund the company to profitability.\" D-Wave plans to use any potential proceeds for general corporate purposes, including funding capital expenditures (capex), acquiring new companies, or expanding the business, as well as for general working capital purposes. The news is disappointing because it comes during a week whenNvidia's CEO Jensen Huang praisedquantum computing. \"We are within reach of being able to apply quantum computing in areas that can solve some interesting problems in the coming years,\" he said. Few CEOs can move the market, but Huang is one of them, being one of the most influential people in the artificial intelligence (AI) sector. Other quantum computing stocks jumped this week. Shareholders never like to see dilutive capital raises, but with D-Wave trading at an extremely high valuation, this is often when management will try and bring in additional capital to fund growth. Either way, it's been an incredible run. D-Wave's stock is up 1,268% over the last year and currently trades at 191 times forward sales. While D-Wave appears to bemaking real progresstoward eventually mass producing quantum computers, it's very difficult to buy stocks at these kinds of meteoric valuations.

The deal is part of a Series B round led by SoftBank, which is anchoring the raise with a $100 million commitment that pegs Skild's valuation at around $4.5 billion.

        "content": "Adobe (ADBE) shares slumped Friday, as the design software developer failed to impress with itsquarterly results, despite topping Wall Street estimates and boosting its full-year outlook. The stock was among theS&P 500's worst-performing constituents Friday, sinking about 5% to close near $392, leaving shares down 12% for 2025. \"The key investor question remains when (if) AI innovation can move the needle,\" wrote Morgan Stanley analysts, who added the quarter \"brought little to quell the bear concern around AI contribution being unable to reaccelerate growth while bulls must remain patient for encouraging AI metrics to move the needle.\" Still, the analysts said they are \"overweight\" on the stock with a $510 target, expecting Adobe AI monetization to ramp up in the next fiscal year. Jefferies analysts, who reiterated a \"buy\" rating and $590 price target on Adobe's potential growth driven by its AI offerings, echoed the comments, writing that while the firm's earnings showed some AI progress, it was \"maybe not enough to appease bears.\" Jefferies also noted that Adobe's forecast, while higher, would imply a slowdown in growth in the fiscal fourth quarter, though they added they believe it \"reflects management's conservatism amid ongoing macro uncertainties.\" Bank of America, which raised its target to $475 from $424 on Adobe's outlook and AI growth potential, said the company demonstrated \"solid execution in a weaker software backdrop,\" calling it a \"break from this reporting season, with most software companies opting not to flow through upside to the full year.\" Citi analysts, however, were less convinced, citing worries growing competition and AI disruption could hold Adobe back. Citi issued a \"neutral\" rating for the stock and $465 target. Deutsche Bank analysts, who affirmed their \"hold\" rating and $475 target, said they \"expect the stock to remain range-bound until the company demonstrates more tangible success from AI.\" This article has been updated since it was first published to reflect more recent share price values.",
