        "content": "A lot has changed forNvidia(NVDA2.53%)in the last five years -- and for its investors. Shares have skyrocketed by more than 1,400% since then, handily outpacing theS&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC), which has only grown by 93% over that same period. So, what do the next five years hold in store for Nvidia? Should investors expect another big rally for the stock, or are shares destined to fall back to Earth? Here's what I think. Image source: Getty Images. First, let's recap what's happened over the last five years for Nvidia. In 2020, Nvidia was already a large company, with amarket capof $225 billion and annual revenue of $13 billion. However, today, the company boasts a market cap of more than $3.4 trillion, and its annualrevenueis almost $150 billion. Behind this incredible rally is the growth of theartificial intelligence (AI)chip market. Nvidia designs thegraphics processing units (GPUs)that provide the computing power required to train and runlarge language models (LLMs). Nvidia's GPUs, like the H100, H200, and Blackwell, have formed the backbone of an AI chip empire that has pushed the companyall the wayto the top of the list of largest American companies (by market cap). One of the most challenging parts of analyzing Nvidia's 2030 prospects is that its chief market -- the GPUdata center industry-- is a cutting-edge field, and it's unclear how much it will grow over the next five years. Because of that, analyst estimates for Nvidia's 2030 revenue vary wildly. Estimates range from the low end of $281 billion to $600 billion at the topend. Beyond the question of how much Nvidia can generate in revenue is how muchof thosesales the company can convert to profits. At the moment, Nvidia has far and away the best margins in its industry. Indeed, its margins stand head and shoulders above some of its longtime competitors likeAMDandIntel.  NVDA Gross Profit Margindata byYCharts However, those companies are ramping up their efforts to compete with Nvidia in the lucrative AI GPU market. AMD has itsownseries of AI GPUs on the market that offer AI developers an alternative to Nvidia. Similarly, Intel ismaking effortsto grow its share of the AI GPU market. Finally, most of the big tech companies, likeApple,Alphabet,Amazon,Microsoft, andMeta Platforms, have also started work on developing their own AI chips. In other words, the market could be a much more competitive space by 2030, even if Nvidia retains its spot at the top, meaning its margins could shrink and its future earnings could grow less than investors might hope for. Nvidia remains one of the top beneficiaries of the AI revolution. And while it's true that increased competition could eat away at the company's margins, it's also true that the rapid growth of the overall AI chip market might outweigh the threat of increased competition. That leads me to believe that Nvidia remains a solid long-term investment. While investors shouldn't count on the stock to duplicate its amazing performance over the last five years, I expect Nvidia to match and modestly outperform the S&P 500 by 2030.",

        "content": "FedEx (FDX) shares dropped in extended trading on Tuesday after the shipping giantsuspended its annual outlook and issued light guidance for the current quarter, which overshadowed quarterly results that surpassed Wall Street expectations. The company declined to issue full-year earnings and revenue forecasts, citing uncertainty over U.S. trade policies. Executives said they expect the Trump administration\u2019s decision in April toend duty-free treatmenton low-value shipments from China to continue weighing on air freight demand, with CEO Raj Subramaniam telling analysts on an earnings webcast that the global demand environment remains volatile. Heading into the company\u2019s earnings report, FedEx shares were down 18% so far in 2025, pressured by uncertainty surrounding tariffs and a falloff in demand from industrial customers. The stock dropped 6% to around $216 in after-hours trading. Below, we take a closer look at the FedEx chart and applytechnical analysisto point out price levels worth watching out for. After bottoming out in early April, FedEx shares consolidated within anascending triangle, a chart pattern that potentially signals acontinuationof the stock\u2019s longer-tern downtrend upon abreakdownfrom the formation. Indeed, the stock looks set to open below the pattern\u2019s lower trendline in Wednesday\u2019s trading session. Let\u2019s identifysupport and resistancelevels on the FedEx chart that investors will likely be monitoring. The first lower level to monitor sits around $214. The shares may encounter support in this area near severalpeaks and troughsthat formed within the ascending triangle over recent months. A decisive breakdown below this key technical level opens the door for a more significant drop to the $194 level. Investors could look forentry pointsat this location near the stock\u2019s prominent early-April low, eyeing a potentialdouble bottom. It\u2019s worth noting this level sits just above a measured movedownsidetarget that calculates the depth of the ascending triangle and deducts that amount from the pattern\u2019s lower trendline. During upswings in the stock, it\u2019s initially worth watching the $233 level. This area on the chart may provide overhead selling pressure on a retest of the ascending triangle\u2019s top trendline. Finally, a convincing close above this level could send FedEx shares toward $254.

        "content": "If you're investing intech stocks, you probably already know a lot about the heavy hitters in the space. Companies likeApple,Microsoft,Nvidia,Amazon,Alphabet, andMetaPlatformseach have market capitalizations of more than $1 trillion, and tend to dominate their markets and investors' attention. Don't get me wrong: All of those are solid investments. But it's also a good strategy for tech investors to look elsewhere for new opportunities. After all, companies likePalantirTechnologieswere barely a blip on the radar just a few years ago. ButPalantir's dynamic growth(showing gains of 500% in the last 12 months) demonstrates the value of finding promising names that may be overlooked by others. The names on this list represent outstanding companies that solve real problems. And each has a market cap of less than $100 billion -- which means there's plenty of room for further growth and profit for your portfolio. Image source: Getty Images. DoorDash(DASH0.63%)got its start in 2013, but it's one of those companies that really took off during the pandemic, as people were much more interested in eating at home than venturing out. That also coincided with the rise of the gig economy, which is where DoorDash thrives. The company operates in 25 countries, delivering various products from businesses to residences (mainly food orders and meals). But I'm most interested in its advertising services, in which it recently announced a new suite of artificial intelligence (AI)-powered tools designed to help businesses, specifically restaurants and brands, enhance their presence on the platform and drive growth. Restaurants will be able to plug in their goals, targets, and budget, and have the AI platform spit out customized ad campaigns. DoorDash also announced earlier this month that it purchased the adtech platform Symbiosys, which will help DoorDash provide advertising over multiple digital channels and platforms. If you're looking for international diversification, consider Singapore-basedSea Limited(SE-0.49%). Sea is a multifaceted technology company involved in digital entertainment, e-commerce, and digital financial services. Its Shopee business is a leading e-commerce platform in Southeast Asia and Taiwan, and also operates in Latin America. Meanwhile, the company's Monee segment (formerly called SeaMoney) provides financial services in Southeast Asia and Brazil. Sea's Garena game studio develops, publishes, and operates some of the most popular online games in the world, primarily for mobile and PC. Overall, the company had revenue in the first quarter of $4.8 billion, up 29.6% from a year ago, and profits of $2.2 billion, which was up 43.9% from the previous year. Airbnb(ABNB0.55%)has been a disruptive force to the hospitality industry -- and provides yet another opportunity for homeowners to participate in the gig economy. The company's platform makes it possible for travelers to rent a room in someone's house, an apartment, or an entire house. Both long-term and short-term renters use Airbnb's platform, and the company helped facilitate more than 2 billion stays since the company was founded in 2007. While Airbnb's growth has slowed in recent years as global tensions and some domestic economic turmoil dampened the travel market, the company continues to post solid numbers. And notably,Cathie Woodand her Ark Invest asset management company picked up 71,500 shares of Airbnb stock recently, a stake valued at $9.42 million. Coinbase Global(COIN6.12%)is another disruptive company that is changing the financial system as we know it. The company's platform makes it possible for anyone to buy, sell, stake, or keepcryptocurrencies. It manages $328 billion in assets and has quarterly trading volume of $393 billion. Granted, there are some investors who are leery of cryptocurrencies, and that makes sense. There are a lot of sketchy altcoins out there. But Coinbase is publicly traded and operates under U.S. regulations. It answers to the Securities and Exchange Commission, and it currently plays ahugerole in helping to define how cryptocurrencies evolve. On top of that, Coinbase is a great company to invest in if you're looking for a proxy to help you trade inEthereumorBitcoinyourself. Snowflake(SNOW0.10%)is a cloud-based data platform. It helps organizations store, manage, and even analyze data across different cloud services. Its platform isn't tied to a single ecosystem because it runs on top of cloud services like Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure. That kind of flexibility is critical to vendors looking for flexible working environments, and should help Snowflake see rapid growth. The company estimates that its market opportunity will increase from $170 billion in 2024 to $355 billion by 2029. As of the first quarter of fiscal 2026 (ending April 30), Snowflake reported $1 billion in revenue, up 26% from a year ago. As disruptive as Airbnb was to the hospitality industry,Robinhood Markets(HOOD3.66%)has been to the financial/investment community. Through its simple platform that allows investors to buy and sell stocks for free, Robinhood has become a dominant player -- and forced other brokerages to provide free trading options as well. Robinhood's platform currently manages $255 billion in assets (up 89% from a year ago) and serves 25.9 million customers (up 7% from last year). When you think about semiconductors, Nvidia is generally the first to come to mind. But if you want an under-the-radarsemiconductor stock, look toMarvell Technology(MRVL0.04%). The company designs chips and, like Nvidia, outsources them to fabricators such asTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. Its data processing units (DPUs) and custom AI chips are increasingly important for AI infrastructure. Revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2026 was $1.89 billion, a new company record. CEO Matt Murphy attributed the strong quarter to increased AI demand in the data center end market. Cloudflare(NET1.49%)is a cybersecurity and web infrastructure company. Not only does it help websites stay online by blocking denial-of-service attacks and the cybercriminals who try to hack into systems, but it also helps websites run faster, because every service is stored on every server on the company's global network, which means data is processed by the server closest to the customers of the companies it serves. And that network is massive, with servers in 330 cities and 125 countries. Cloudflare says it can reach 95% of the global population within 50 milliseconds. Block(XYZ-0.05%)is an interesting company because of how much it's changed. Formerly known as Square, the company founded by Jack Dorsey was best known for making small square devices that allowed people to put their smartphones to work processing credit card payments. That led to Square launching Cash App to facilitate a peer-to-peer payments platform to get around the need for the devices. The Cash App platform has since expanded to offer multiple other banking and brokerage services, including stock and cryptocurrency trading. Eventually, the company changed to Block to fully embrace its focus on blockchain and Bitcoin, and the company now has products for Bitcoin mining, Bitcoin wallets, and tools to help people manage their spending.",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) \u2014 Investors looking for new ways to bet on artificial intelligence infrastructure have been piling into an old but often overlooked name: Micron Technology Inc. (MU). Most Read from Bloomberg Bezos Wedding Draws Protests, Soul-Searching Over Tourism in Venice US Renters Face Storm of Rising Costs US State Budget Wounds Intensify From Trump, DOGE Policy Shifts Commuters Are Caught in Johannesburg's Taxi Feuds as Transit Lags The maker of memory chips, which reports earnings after market close on Wednesday, has seen its shares roughly double since the S&P 500 (^GSPC) bottomed in April, and is the index\u2019s fifth-best performer over that span. Spending on AI computing gear has sent investors hunting for beneficiaries beyond marquee stocks like Nvidia Corp. Micron\u2019s growth is being fueled by high-bandwidth memory \u2014 bundles of dynamic random access memory chips closely connected to processors from Nvidia \u2014 which is vital to AI computing. That\u2019s helped drive up prices as supply remains constrained due to the complexity of producing and deploying such components. \u201cMicron isn\u2019t the star of AI, the way Nvidia (NVDA) is, but high-bandwidth memory chips are the gold standard for powering AI, and the demand for them is insatiable,\u201d said Joe Tigay, portfolio manager of the Rational Equity Armor Fund. The Boise, Idaho-based company is expected to report adjusted earnings per share of $1.60 on revenue of about $8.9 billion, according to the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That would be an increase of 158% and 30% from the same period a year ago, respectively. \u201cPricing and availability of Micron\u2019s high-bandwidth memory will be a central focus,\u201d said Jake Behan, head of capital markets at Direxion. \u201cInvestors will be looking for clarity on production, supply constraints, and how well-positioned Micron is to meet hyperscaler and AI customer demand.\u201d Profitability will also be top of mind for investors after gross margins fell short of Wall Street expectations in the second quarter. Analysts at NewStreet Research are anticipating a recovery in DRAM and NAND gross margins, which would help Micron beat expectations. Adjusted gross margins are projected to be 36.8% in the third quarter, down from 37.9% in the previous quarter, according to the average of analyst estimates. Of course, anything short of a stellar report could trigger a selloff considering the magnitude of the stock\u2019s gains. Micron is up 95% since April 8, the day before US President Donald Trump sparked a relief rally by pausing tariffs. Options market trading implies a move of 8% for the stock the day after the report, above the average over the past decade, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. While Rational Equity Armor Fund\u2019s Tigay remains bullish on Micron, he acknowledges the rally may be difficult to sustain in the near term. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t surprise me to see some consolidation around earnings, or in the summer months, before the rally resumes later this year,\u201d Tigay said. Tech Chart of the Day Worldline SA shares fell by more than a fifth on Wednesday, following reports that the company allegedly covered up fraud by customers. Shares in the French payment firm plunged after the publication of a series of articles co-ordinated by the European journalism network EIC.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Micron Technology, Inc. MU, NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Broadcom Inc. AVGO and Marvell Technology, Inc. MRVL. Micron Technology, Inc.will report fiscal third-quarter earnings after the closing bell on Wednesday. With its strong performance in the S&P 500 this month, a notable increase in both revenues and profits in the upcoming report could boost its stock price. So, should investors buy Micron stock pre-earnings or await clarity on margins? Let\u2019s explore \u2013 Micron is expected to report earnings per share (EPS) of $1.59 in the fiscal third quarter, a substantial increase from $0.62 in the same quarter last year, representing a year-over-year jump of 156.5%. Strong demand for Micron\u2019s products in high-value segments, coupled with improved pricing conditions, is expected to drive the company\u2019s earnings. Revenues are estimated to reach $8.84 billion in the fiscal third quarter, up 29.7% from last year\u2019s sales of $6.81 billion. It\u2019s also more than the fiscal second quarter\u2019s sales of $8.05 billion. Sequentially rising sales indicate increased demand in memory markets, especially those driven by artificial intelligence (AI). Additionally, Micron\u2019s 10.7% average positive earnings surprise over the past four quarters indicates a strong likelihood of meeting its fiscal third-quarter results and boosting its stock price. (Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.) With the rise of AI, the demand for graphics processing units (GPUs) has grown because they can handle multiple tasks more efficiently. Now, GPUs require data storage memory, with Micron\u2019s HBM3E leading the industry. NVIDIA Corp., therefore, has selected Micron\u2019s HBM for its upcoming GB200 and GB300 Blackwell systems. Additionally, other chipmakers likeBroadcom Inc.andMarvell Technology, Inc.are working on integrating HBM into their platforms, suggesting potential growth for Micron. Micron expects the data center HBM market to grow to $35 billion this year, reaching $100 billion by 2030. The company confirmed that it has sold out its entire HBM capacity for this year and is negotiating new contracts for next year. The high demand for HBM has allowed Micron to increase its pricing by 11% in 2025. The rise in HBM demand and prices positions Micron for strong earnings both in the upcoming report and in the future. Micron also stands to benefit from the growing demand for DRAM in AI smartphones and PCs. Strong earnings expectations from high demand for HBM products will boost Micron\u2019s stock price. The projected rise in NVIDIA\u2019s AI chip sales due to Micron\u2019s HBM3E in their GPUs will further benefit its business and stock value. Micron also plans to increase market share against Samsung, as the latter faces challenges passing NVIDIA\u2019s qualification test with HBM3E memory chips, compared to Micron\u2019s improving HBM-chip yields. Stakeholders should, thus, hold Micron stock for long-term positive returns. Brokers, too, are somewhat positive about Micron\u2019s prospects, increasing the average short-term price target for MU to $127.07 (up 2.8%) from $123.60. The highest target is $172, indicating a potential 39.2% upside. However, investors should be cautious about Micron\u2019s declining gross margin; it fell from 39.5% in the first quarter to 37.9% in the second, with a forecast of 36.5% for the third quarter. Despite revenue growth, margin compression occurs due to intense price competition counteracting the benefits from increased volumes and better market scenarios. Hence, new entrants should delay betting on Micron stock until after the fiscal third-quarter results for clarity on revenue growth and margin pressures. For now, Micron has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

        "content": "Investing in growth stocks can lead to significant long-run returns. It isn't always evident, however, how a company's future will pan out. Some businesses that look like surefire winners will end up failing. Others will benefit from unexpected catalysts, such as artificial intelligence (AI), that you couldn't have predicted when you first invested in them. That's why investing in multiplegrowth stockscan be a great idea because all you need is one big winner, one huge return to make it worth your while. Three stocks that are excellent examples of how just a single investment can yield life-changing returns areNvidia(NVDA1.28%),Netflix(NFLX0.84%), andBooking Holdings(BKNG-0.24%). By investing just $5,000 into any of these stocks 20 years ago and hanging on until today, you would be up more than $1 million. Image source: Getty Images. One of the biggest growth stories in recent years has been that of chipmaker Nvidia. It has made many millionaires as its business has taken off due to AI. Its chips are no longer used for just gaming, but are now critical in the development of AI technologies, including chatbots. While Nvidia has been a solid growth stock for years, things have gone to a whole other level since ChatGPT came on the scene in late 2022. That led to a flurry of tech spending and AI-related investments. In the trailing 12 months, Nvidia has generated a whopping $77 billion in profit. Just a few years ago it wasn't even bringing in that much inrevenue. As a leading AI chipmaker, Nvidia still possesses a lot of long-term potential, which is why as long as you're looking for a stock to buy and hold,you're likely better off buying now than hoping for a big dip in price. If you'd invested $5,000 into this stock 20 years ago, you'd be sitting on an investment worth more than $3.1 million today. The trajectory for Netflix has been more consistent over the years, with the company revolutionizing its business model over time under great management. It went from mailing out DVDs to customers to offering streaming to now getting into live TV, sports, and even gaming. It has even been making its own content, as a way to expand its library and be less dependent on studios for licensing deals. The company is now a $40 billion business, and a highly profitable one, with net margins of more than 23%. It has been the model that other companies look to as proof that the streaming business can indeed be lucrative. It has pushed through multiple price hikes over the years and cracked down on password sharing, and while those moves may have appeared controversial when they took place, they have clearly paid off for the business, simply because Netflix provides consumers with such an attractive value proposition. A $5,000 investment in the company 20 years ago would now be worth about $3 million, not far behind Nvidia. Although thestreaming stockis trading at all-time highs, Netflix can still make for a good long-term investment as it continually finds ways to expand. Another millionaire-making investment during the past 20 years has been Booking Holdings. Just a $5,000 investment in the company back then would have grown to a little less than $1.1 million today. The company is a leader in online travel sites and services. When you're looking to book online travel, you may find yourself using one of its highly popular websites -- kayak.com, priceline.com, or booking.com. The internet has revolutionized travel and what decades ago involved calling or seeing a travel agent can now easily be done online, potentially soon via AI agents. And to compare prices, websites like the ones Booking owns can ensure you're getting the best deal out there. Last year, the company generated $23.7 billion in sales (up more than 11% from the previous year), earning a profit of $5.9 billion. And while the business has grown significantly over the years, it doesn't look all that expensive given its growth potential, trading at 33 times its trailing earnings. The business has great margins and can be an excellent way to invest in thetravel industry.",

It\u2019s the third such deal since 2024, and by far the largest. They occurred during periods when the Taiwan dollar tended to appreciate. The moves grant TSMC Global \u2014 the vehicle responsible for managing overseas investments and hedging \u2014 more capital flexibility in managing exchange rate risks. Recent gains by the Taiwan dollar have caused worries in Taipei about the economy\u2019s heavy reliance on exports. In May, the currency notched its biggest single-day gain since the 1980s, spurring calls from the central bank to curb speculation. \u201cGenerally speaking, the heightened forex volatility would mean that banks may be adjusting their margin requirements,\u201d said Philip McNicholas, Asia sovereign strategist at Robeco based in Singapore. \u201cIssuing new shares, and bringing in an immediate cash injection, may help companies manage the margin requirements on both existing and new hedges.\u201d TSMC, the main chipmaker to Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp., is by far the island\u2019s biggest company and exporter because the majority of its production is domestic. A stronger Taiwan dollar hurts exporters because the US dollars they earn from sales abroad would translate into less of the local currency, or they would need to raise their prices overseas and risk denting demand.

        "header": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang Thinks Tesla Has a Multitrillion-Dollar Artificial Intelligence (AI) Opportunity Up Its Sleeve (Hint: It's Not Robotaxi)",
        "content": "Tesla's(TSLA-0.11%)quest to revolutionize the automobile industry is not limited to mass-producing electric vehicles (EV). While cars represent Tesla's primary product today, the company has a vision to become an artificial intelligence (AI) empire. The most direct way that Tesla is deploying AI is through the introduction of autonomous vehicles. Tesla is seeking to create a fleet of self-driving cars, known as therobotaxi, that can be hailed by consumers -- similar to applications such asUberorLyft. While this is an exciting initiative, Tesla has another AI project that receives little attention: humanoid robotics. Recently,NvidiaCEOJensen Huangproclaimed that humanoid robotics could be a \"multitrillion-dollar industry.\" Furthermore, Huang specifically referenced the Tesla Optimus as one of the leading robotics businesses that excites him. Let's explore the different ways that Optimus might help Tesla. In addition, I'll analyze recent price action in Tesla stock to assess if now is a good time to buy the stock. On the surface, the idea of humanoid robots might sound like something out of a science fiction novel. However, what investors may not realize is that Tesla is far from the only company exploring the intersection of robotics and AI. When it comes to humanoid bots specifically, one of the more prominent start-ups isFigure AI-- which attracted a number of high-profile investors, including Nvidia. Watch Helix's neural network do 60 minutes of uninterrupted logistics workHelix now incorporates touch and short-term memory and it's performance continuously improves over timepic.twitter.com/DvfBe9IdGH  The video above demonstrates an example of how Figure AI plans to deploy its robots in labor-intensive environments , such as factories. The idea here is that complementing human workers alongside robotics can yield a new level of productivity, automation, and efficiency in the workforce. I see two major ways that Tesla stands to benefit from Optimus. The use ofmachine learningcould help train Optimus on tasks that are currently performed by human workers along Tesla's assembly line. Over time, Optimus could become sophisticated enough to complete important aspects of the manufacturing process. In theory, Tesla could subsequently deploy fleets of Optimus bots across its various factories worldwide -- having them work around the clock. At scale, this could lead to a major increase in vehicle production. This idea could be parlayed into more applications. For example, Tesla not only stands to benefit from selling Optimus to other labor-heavy industries, but it could also introduce the technology into more mundane settings beyond factory work. The notion that humanoid robots could complement or even replace physical workers across the globe is what is driving Musk's projection thatOptimus could be worth several trillionin the future -- far greater than the core EV business. Image source: Getty Images. With Tesla shares up nearly 30%, it's important to zoom out and consider why Tesla stock is moving so sharply right now.  TSLAdata byYCharts At the moment, the biggest storyline surrounding Tesla is the long-awaited robotaxi launch. Withinitial deployment in Texas this week, Tesla bulls have been cheering on the stock. While I personally remain a Tesla optimist, I think the stock has gotten ahead of itself. Given the dynamics of the price action above, it would appear that thenear-term upside from a successful robotaxi launch is already baked into Tesla stock. As I've written previously, Tesla is a stock that tends to move based on narratives rather than the underlying realities surrounding the company. I see Optimus and the idea of humanoid robotics as no different than the robotaxi. Although Optimus has the potential to completely transform Tesla, the timeline on which this new business scales and its execution relative to the competition remain question marks. I think smart investors should continue to monitor Tesla's progress in the AI realm but wait until these various ambitions begin moving the needle for the company before buying the stock.",

        "header": "Better Artificial Intelligence Stock: Palantir vs. Nvidia",
        "content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) industry is enjoying explosive growth, making it a great area to invest in. Forecasts estimate the AI market will expand from $244 billion in 2025 to $1 trillion by 2031. Two standout stocks in the sector arePalantir Technologies(PLTR1.58%)andNvidia(NVDA1.28%). Palantir shares have rocketed more than 400% over the past 12 months through the week ending June 20. Nvidia is seeing its stock surging back from a 52-week low of $86.62 in April to near its January peak of $153.13. Both companies offer reasons to invest in their stocks, but if you had to choose one, which would be the better AI investment for the long run? Here's a look at Palantir and Nvidia to arrive at an answer. Image source: Getty Images. Palantir is a compelling investment choice because of the massive success of its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP). Since AIP's launch in 2023, the company's business has been booming. For instance, in the first quarter, revenue rose 39% year over year to $883.9 million. Ryan Taylor, Palantir's chief revenue and legal officer, stated, \"Unrelenting demand for AIP continues to drive outperformance despite Q1 historically being our slowest quarter due to business seasonality.\" Its strong start to 2025 contributed to the company raising its full-year sales guidance from $3.7 billion to $3.9 billion. This represents a substantial increase from 2024's $2.9 billion in revenue. Not only is AIP successful, the company is expanding its revenue opportunities by offering new AI products. One is Warp Speed, which uses AI to boost U.S. manufacturing efficiencies, such as handling resource planning and anticipating supply chain changes. About Warp Speed, CTO Shyam Sankar noted, \"Both the adoption and the rate of product development has exceeded expectations.\" Palantir's sales growth has translated into strong financials. Its Q1 net income reached $217.7 million, more than double 2024's $106.1 million. The company'sfree cash flow(FCF) of $370.4 million is an impressive 42% year-over-year increase. The rationale for Nvidia's attractiveness as an AI investment begins with its leadership in semiconductor chips for AI. Its market share in this area is estimated to exceed 70%. Nvidia's popular AI chips helped sales grow 69% year over year to $44.1 billion in its fiscal Q1, ended April 27. The company isn't resting on its laurels. Nvidia introduced its latest AI computing architecture, Blackwell, last year and has already announced Vera Rubin as Blackwell's successor. Vera Rubin is expected to arrive in 2026. What makes Nvidia's new tech compelling for customers is that it's designed for the age of AI reasoning in which AI can more closely mimic human thinking. This ability is essential for agentic AI, which refers to AI systems capable of making decisions and completing tasks on their own. Nvidia's popular hardware is only part of its strength. It also provides software called the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA). CUDA is an essential tool to customize Nvidia's hardware when building AI systems, and this makesswitching costshigher. Like Palantir, Nvidia's financials are excellent. Fiscal Q1 net income rose 26% year over year to $18.8 billion, while FCF hit $26.1 billion, a 75% increase from the prior year's $14.9 billion. However, Nvidia's global leadership in AI chips took a step back in China because of U.S. government restrictions on selling AI components to the country. News reports indicate Nvidia is revising its hardware specs to gain approval to commence sales into China once again. Even without China, Nvidia is poised for years of growth as businesses and governments rush to build AI capabilities. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang noted, \"Countries around the world are recognizing AI as essential infrastructure -- just like electricity and the internet -- and Nvidia stands at the center of this profound transformation.\" Because Palantir and Nvidia are both strong businesses, choosing between them is a challenge. Stock valuation is one factor that can aid in this decision. Here's a look at each company'sprice-to-earnings(P/E) ratio, which tells you how much investors are willing to pay for a dollar's worth of a company's earnings based on the trailing 12 months.  Data byYCharts. As the chart shows, Nvidia's P/E multiple is just a fraction of Palantir's, indicating Nvidia is the better value. In fact, Palantir's P/E ratio has climbed higher in recent months, suggesting the stock is overpriced. This key factor makes Nvidia's stock the superior investment over Palantir. Beyond valuation, Nvidia's established leadership in AI and its ongoing push to evolve its AI tech positions the company for years of sustained success.",

        "content": "The Integrated Solution Supports the Explosion of AI Workloads with Owned and Operated Data Centers with Dedicated Power Generation San Diego, California--(Newsfile Corp. - June 25, 2025) - Sonim Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: SONM), a leading provider of rugged mobile solutions, today announced the signing of a non-binding Letter of Intent (LOI) for a proposed reverse take-over (RTO) with a private US-based company (the \"Target\") building out Nvidia-based High-Performance Computing (HPC) A.I. factories to support the hyper growth of cloud-based artificial intelligence (AI) workloads. Key terms of the proposed transaction include: The LOI outlines the framework for a strategic business combination pursuant to which stockholders of the HPC A.I. factory Target would own a majority in the combined company. Sonim stockholders would retain equity valued at $17.5 million in the combined company. The HPC A.I. factory Target would be valued at approximately $300 million, with the valuation expected to be supported by a fairness opinion from an independent third party. Following the closing, the combined company is expected to adopt a new corporate name and ticker symbol while maintaining its listing on Nasdaq. Sonim believes that, when combined with the previously announced sale of substantially all of its operating assets for $15 million (plus an additional earn-out of $5 million), the proposed RTO transaction will maximize stockholder value and provide a compelling path forward for Sonim's strategic evolution.The Target is poised for significant growth by focusing on High-Performance Computing as a Service (HPCaaS). By leveraging their owned data centers, they aim to accelerate expansion, lower operational risks, and tap into the high-margin, fast-growing AI factory market. With plans to activate thousands of GPUs in 2025, they're positioning themselves to meet surging demand for the utility of the future, \"Intelligence as a Service.\" The global demand for AI-ready high-performance computing factory capacity is projected to grow at an average annual rate of 33% through 2030, with AI workloads driving up to 70% of total demand1. AI infrastructure spending is expected to exceed $200 billion by 2028, underscoring the transformative potential of this market2. To meet this surging demand, leading data center players are preparing to invest $1.8 trillion from 2024 to 2030, driven by traditional enterprise workloads (55% of demand in 2028) and the explosive growth of GenAI, which will account for 60% of total demand growth during this period3. In the U.S., initiatives such as Executive Order 14141 and a $500 billion private joint venture aim to bolster domestic AI infrastructure, with Congress emphasizing AI infrastructure as a strategic national asset4. \"This transaction positions Sonim stockholders to benefit from the tremendous growth of the AI revolution and represents a transformational step for Sonim and its stockholders,\" said Mike Mulica, Chair of the Special Committee for Sonim. \"The RTO structure allows us to align with a forward-thinking partner in the AI and digital transformation space, leveraging their expertise to create a market-leading, technology-driven enterprise. At the same time, the CVR ensures our stockholders benefit from the successful transition of our legacy business.\" The LOI is non-binding, and the transaction is further subject to customary closing conditions, regulatory approval, approval by Sonim stockholders and the completion of the Sonim Legacy Business Sale. The parties intend to finalize the definitive agreement and proceed with securing necessary approvals in a timely manner.

        "content": "Here are three of the top stories Wall Street is watching on Wednesday, June 25. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) is within striking distance of an all-time high. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will be returning to Capitol Hill to testify before the Senate Banking Committee. One stock in focus is Nvidia (NVDA), which holds its annual shareholder meeting today. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Briefhere. Welcome to Yahoo Finance's flagship show, The Morning Brief from Brad Smith. Let's get to the three things that you need to know today. First up, US stock futures little changed today as the S&P 500 trades just within points of its all-time high. Meanwhile, tech stocks are leading the charge as the Nasdaq 100 closes out at a fresh record. But the higher stocks go, the louder the concern that multiples are starting to look frothy becomes. The S&P 500 is currently trading at 22 times expected profits in the next 12 months. That's 35% above its long-term average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Plus, traders are awaiting a second day of testimony from Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell. The head of the Fed traded softly when he appeared before Congress on Tuesday, indicating the central bank is monitoring data before making any adjustments to its policy. Investors will be closely watching for any signs on the central bank's rate path ahead of its July meeting. And Nvidia's annual general meeting kicking off today. Shareholders will vote to re-elect the company's board at the event and will be watching an advisory vote on executive compensation. But no major fireworks are expected there. The meeting comes at a time when some on Wall Street are calling for the company to reach a $6 trillion valuation. That is the anticipation knocking around this morning. And analysts at Loop Capital note that Nvidia is at the front end of the next golden wave of Gen AI adoption and expect a material leg of stronger than anticipated demand.",

        "content": "Investing.com -- Loop Capital raised its price target on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) to $250 from $175, saying capital spending on chips that power generative AI systems is growing far faster than investors expect. Analyst John Donovan said checks with cloud-service providers and other large technology buyers point to a surge in demand for graphics-processing units or GPUs and custom AI accelerators.The firm estimates that spending on non-central-processing-unit compute, largely GPUs, could climb to about $2 trillion in 2028, or roughly 50% to 60% of total installed compute capacity, compared with about 15% today. \u201cThe math just works,\u201d Donovan wrote, adding that the projected investment could support a $6 trillion market value for Nvidia if the company meets the brokerage\u2019s earnings forecast. Nvidia shares were up about 1.2% at $149.30 in premarket trading. Loop Capital said the ramp-up of Nvidia\u2019s new Blackwell-generation chips, coupled with widening adoption of AI \u201cfactory\u201d data centres by governments, start-ups and mid-size cloud providers, positions the chipmaker for another leg of demand after rapid growth in 2023 and 2024. The firm now expects Nvidia to ship 6.5 million GPUs in calendar 2025 and 7.5 million in 2026 at average selling prices above $40,000 each.It also sees an expanding market for AI inference, the running of machine-learning models \u2013 as reasoning-oriented software agents move into production. Donovan cautioned that the new target assumes Nvidia continues to trade around 30 times forward earnings, in line with other large U.S. technology companies.A lower multiple would imply that \u201cprice-earnings compression\u201d could offset some of the forecast growth, he said.

        "header": "This Is the Most Important Investing Skill. Can You Do It?",
        "content": "The most important investing skill doesn't involve performing advanced technical analysis or picking hot stocks. It's something much simpler: Patience. Decades of market data and behavioral research show thatdisciplined, long-term investorsconsistently outperform those who chase quick wins or react emotionally to short-term volatility. \"Investing is about building wealth steadily over time,\"Yvan Byeajee, author of \"Trading Composure: Mastering Your Mind for Trading Success,\" told\u00a0Investopedia. \"The key phrase is over time. If you're chasing instant riches, the odds are that you'll accept gambles that are unlikely to pay off.\" In other words, the ability to wait without flinching through market ups and downs is one of the most powerful advantages an investor can have. It\u2019s not about timing the market, but time in the market that builds lasting wealth. Market history is clear: the longer you stay invested, the better your odds of success. Over the past century, the average annual return of the S&P 500 has been about 10%, but this figure masks wild short-term swings.For example, in 2022, stocks represented by the S&P 500 dropped 19.4% in value, but gained 24.2% the following year. That said, those invested over the long haul would have seen a significant upward trend over time, despite this volatility. A 2023 Morgan Stanley report analyzed the probability of losing money in the MSCI World Index over different time horizons from 1970 to 2023, finding that investors were much less likely to lose money the longer they stayed invested.For example, over a one-year investment horizon, 23% of months resulted in negative returns. But over a 10-year investment horizon, that figure dropped to just 3%. Dollar-cost averaging is patience put into practice. By investing a fixed amount regularly\u2014regardless of market conditions\u2014you automatically buy more shares when prices are low and fewer shares when they're high. This disciplined approach removes the temptation to time the market andreduces the impact of volatilityon your portfolio. The chart below illustrates how a simple $50 monthly investment in the S&P 500 would have grown over time, transforming consistent contributions into wealth despite market fluctuations. Part of the reason for the gains is thepower of compounding\u2014earning returns on both your original investment and the interest it generates. Impatience often leads investors to buy high and sell low, chasing trends or fleeing during downturns. A quantitative analysis of investor behavior by Dalbar, a market research firm, shows that the average investor earns far less than the market due to poor timing decisions. For example, theaverage equity investorgained about 16.5% in 2024, compared with the S&P 500's 25.05% gain.The difference? Emotional reactions to short-term volatility. Warren Buffett, perhaps the world\u2019s most famous investor, attributes much of his success to patience. \"My life has been a product of compound interest,\" he told Bloomberg in a 2016 interview. In 1985, Buffett explained Berkshire Hathaway's decision to help finance Cap Cities' $3.5 billion acquisition of American Broadcasting Companies (ABC). \"For Cap Cities, ABC is a major undertaking whose economics are likely to be unexciting over the next few years. This bothers us not an iota; we can be very patient,\" Buffett wrote in Berkshire Hathaway's shareholder letter that year. \"No matter how great the talent or effort, some things just take time: you can\u2019t produce a baby in one month by getting nine women pregnant.\" Ten years later, the Walt Disney Company (DIS) bought Cap Cities and ABC in a $19 billion deal. Patience is the single most important skill forbuilding long-term wealth. The data is clear: Those who stay invested, resist emotional reactions, and let compounding work its magic are rewarded over time. The next time markets get rocky, remember: Your greatest advantage is the ability to wait.",

        "header": "How Comparing Yourself to Others Can Derail Your Investment Strategy",
        "content": "Scrolling through stock market leaderboards or hearing a colleague brag about their holdings may feel harmless. Yet, a growing body of behavioral research shows that the simple act of comparing yourself to other investors can warp your decision-making. Investors shown a scoreboard of top stock performers tend to pile into riskier positions, increase their trading frequency, and still walk away less satisfied with their own results. The pattern is not confined to simulated markets, nor does it affectday tradersalone. Peer comparison shapes everything from core portfolio holdings to 401(k) contribution rates. The common thread: When we focus on relative performance, our brains shift fromlong-term wealth buildingto short-term status-checking, often at a financial cost. Modern brokerage apps incorporate social comparison and gamification into their interfaces.Robinhood, for example, highlights the day\u2019s most-bought stocks, effectively showing users what \u201ceveryone else\u201d is doing. An analysis of millions of trades on an unnamed \"social trading platform\" found that attention-induced buying not only spikes turnover but also increases thevolatilityof returns. Seeing others rush in triggers afear-of-missing-out (FOMO)loop: Investors chase the same tickers, increase leverage, and crowd into big-name stocks that amplify swings. Simply displaying a top-10 leaderboard nudged otherwise savvy traders to allocate a greater portion of their simulated portfolio to riskier stocks. When asked about it afterward, those investors rated their satisfaction lower than a control group that never saw peer rankings, even when their raw returns were identical.Studies also show that investors who check their accounts more frequently tend to tolerate less risk and earn less money, focusing more on their losses than their gains.Other studies show that comparing yourself to others has a larger effect on happiness than your actual income. Social comparison, in short, raises the emotional stakes while reducing perceived success. Why does performance satisfaction sag even when returns are decent? Relative thinking changes the reference point: A 10% gain feels like failure if your group chat claims 15%. That moving target pushes investors toward riskier bets, where the odds of lagging rise even further, perpetuating the cycle. Workplace retirement plans might seem more insulated from day-trading hype, but social cues still seep in. In a large field experiment, researchers told low-saving employees how many of their age-matched coworkers were contributing at least 6% of their pay to their401(k). Instead of nudging laggards to catch up, the peer statistic decreased their savings rates\u2014evidence that upward comparisons are demotivating. Peer effects can also influenceasset allocation, but in the other direction. Studies that looked at 401(k) plan allocations showed that participants who realize their stock exposure lags that of their coworkers often increase their exposure, while those who are already heavily invested in stocks rarely dial risk back. The result can often be riskier portfolios that may not align with individual goals,time horizons, orrisk tolerance. Social comparison is often unavoidable\u2014especially in the social-media age\u2014but you can take certain steps to reduce its influence. Define investor success as progress toward your ownfinancial goals; automate contributions into well-diversifiedindex funds; and limit exposure to trending \"hot\" stocks, real-time leaderboards, or boastful forums. When you trade based on FOMO or try only to beat others in the market, you can end up trailing major indexes, paying more in fees, and enjoying it less. Focusing on your personal benchmark restores the most valuable investing edge of all\u2014peace of mind.",

From aggressive tariff policies and threats by the new administration to war in the Middle East, uncertainty and volatility have been constant themes affecting markets and investor sentiment. Through it all, however, individual investors have mostly remained committed to their investing strategies, and are cautiously optimistic about their portfolios and the future, according toInvestopedia\u2019slatest survey of its newsletter readers.

        "content": "Saving for retirement can be a worry at any age, but it's particularly difficult for younger workers who may be at the bottom of the income ladder. However, you don't have to have a lot of money saved up to be on track. Fidelity recommends that young workers save one year of their salary by the end of their twenties. So if you make $50,000 a year, your goal should be to have $50,000 saved for retirement by the time you're 30. The sooner you start saving for retirement, the more you can benefit fromcompound interest. Fidelity recommendssaving 15% of your incomestarting at age 25, which includesemployer matching contributions. You should also put more than 50% of your investments in stocks, which are riskier but offer higher potential returns than other investments. Ultimately, Fidelity suggests that people aim to have have ten years' worth of income saved by the time they're age 67. This projection assumes that people can rely onSocial Security benefitsand collect benefits when they reachfull retirement age, which is age 67 for those born 1960 or later. Your twenties and thirties can be an exciting time of life, betweenweddings, babies, paying forchildcare, and buying a house. With all these expensive life events, it can be difficult to be consistent about saving for retirement. \"It\u2019s okay to pause or scale back temporarily when managing major life events, but do it with a plan,\" saysChristopher Stroup, a CFP and founder of Silicon Beach Financial. \"If you\u2019re deferring retirement savings for childcare or housing, make sure it\u2019s a short-term strategy with a specific timeline to resume contributions and rebalance priorities.\" You can start saving for retirement in a401(k) planor anindividual retirement account(IRA_, such as atraditional IRAor aRoth IRA. If you're investing in a 401(k) or another employer-sponsored plan, make sure to invest enough to get anymatching contributions from your employer. \"Start slow by saving a little in your 401(k) or IRA and then increase that amount by 1 to 2% every year,\" saidAlex Caswell, a CFP at Wealth Script Advisors. \"Create a habit of watching your expenses. Carefully evaluate what part of your expenses makes you truly happy and what part of your expenses are more frivolous and careless spending.\" Do your best to keep retirement at the top of your savings list. But if you can't save 15% of your income, try to keep investing smaller amounts towards your retirement goal. \"If you\u2019re able to save 15%, that\u2019s great.\u00a0But if you\u2019re not, a great starting goal is to try and get to saving 10% of your salary towards retirement,\" saysShaun Melby, a certified financial planner at Melby Wealth Management.\u00a0\"Once you reach 10%, try and increase it 1% every year or when you get a raise.\" Those small additions to your retirement savings can add up over time, especially through market gains andcompounding interest. In addition to saving a year's salary by age 30, Fidelity also recommends the following targets:  To get their retirement savings on the right track, twenty-somethings should try to annually save 15% of their salary for retirement. As a rule-of-thumb, you should aim to have one year's salary invested by age 30. But anything is better than nothing. If you can't save 15% of your salary, aim for 10% and gradually increase this amount.",

        "content": "Nike (NKE) is scheduled to post fiscal fourth-quarter results after the market closes on Thursday, with investors expecting a sizable move following the report. Current options pricing suggests traders expect shares could move close to 8%, or roughly $5 in either direction in the wake of the results. At the high end, that would leave shares near $66, or just above $56 at the low end. Nike shares have moved an average of about 8% in the sessions following its last four earnings reports, with declines of 5%, 6%, and nearly 20%, along with one 0.3% gain.Last quarter, the company said tariffs could negatively impact its sales, and said its plan to shift into new inventory could also slow sales as older franchises see sales decline. Nike shares have lost roughly a fifth of their value so far this year, and nearly 40% in the last 12 months as the shoe retailer has faced declining sales and a change in leadership. Analystsexpect Nike to reporta decline of about 15% in revenue year-over-year to $10.73 billion, while earnings per share are projected to drop sharply to $0.13 from $0.99 a year ago. Bank of America analysts said recently that they will be more focused on the company's long-term outlook amidnew CEO Elliott Hill'sturnaround effort than short-term results. Several analysts have said they prefer to wait on the sidelines ofNike's turnaround, with eight of the 17 brokers tracked by Visible Alpha giving the stock a \"hold,\" while another eight say it's a \"buy\" and just one calls it a \"sell.\" The stock has an average price target near $72, suggesting 18% upside from Wednesday's close.",

Bank of America raised its price target Wednesday for shares of the chicken-wing chain from $360 to $430, matching the highest price target shared by other analysts that follow Wingstop (WING) and were polled by Visible Alpha. The $430 target is well above the roughly $370 average analyst price target, per Visible Alpha. Wingstop appears poised to improve its performance with loyalty and sports marketing, the bank's analysts wrote in a Wednesday note on the fast-casual dining sector. The company has room to expand its footprint and grow more efficient, helped by an AI tool embedded in its order management system, Bank of America said. \u201cThe AI engine that [Wingstop] has been training for the past two years ingests hundreds of datapoints\u2014everything from an individual restaurant's sales by day and daypart to external factors like weather, the sporting calendar (betting lines) and school schedules,\" the bank's analysts wrote last month. \"The result is not just more efficient operations \u2026 but also improved employee engagement.\" Wingstop shares finished Wednesday down about 2%. They have climbed some 25% so far this year. Bank of America was also relatively bullish on Shake Shack (SHAK), saying the burger joint has embraced industry best practices, but may have a harder time expanding due to growing competition.

The big story of the day is Nvidia (NVDA), which closed at a new record high. Yahoo Finance Markets ReporterJosh Schaferand Fundstrat Global Advisors managing director and global head of technical strategy Mark Newton discuss the market action at the close. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination Overtimehere. That is the closing bell on Wall Street, and now it's market domination Overtime in full team coverage of all the moves to get you up to speed on the action from today's trade. Josh Shafer is here with me as well as Mark Newton, fundstrat global advisor, managing director, and global head of technical strategy. So markets, looking at the popular average here, looks like we're in mix. The Dow is going to finish down about 90 points. The S&P 500 looking unchanged, flat at 6092. I have the Nasdaq up about three tenths of a percent. Joshua, over to you from Morgan where the markets closed. Yeah, Josh. So, as you mentioned, not a ton of action in your major averages. And there really wasn't even a ton of movement when you look at just this intraday of the S&P 500. I think at the peak of the day, we were maybe up 0.2%. So really, markets didn't even move that much at the index level either. Couple other things I want to hit on, Josh, that we had sort of been following over the last couple days. So the 10-year T note, we had been talking about, right? Of course, that had been on a recent decline. Did not move much today. Then I'm going to flip over to Bitcoin. Let's take a look at how Bitcoin did on the day. Bitcoin up slightly over 107,000 a coin right now. And then also looking over at oil. Oil ticked up a little bit today. We had been following a pretty big decrease in oil over the last two days, right? If I flip this to a three day, that had sort of been the story of the market to start the week was oil lower, stocks up. But the big news, I think in a world where we didn't have too much move today, Nvidia. We had Nvidia hit a record close today for the first time since, I believe, it was January. So one of the first record closes for Nvidia of the year. And if you just flip out over the last month or the last three months, stock's been on a pretty good run off the bottom, right? So this was sort of your April low off the tariff news. Nvidia fell with the rest of the market. Stock has been looking pretty good and now hitting a new all-time high. I will also call out just broadly the semis have been doing pretty well. So if you look at the chip sector and then take a look at a three day here, we had a decent rally in semis yesterday. You can see Broadcom is up 6% over the last three days. AMD up 12% over the last three days. So decent action there. And then I'll just close out here with the sectors on the day and get your out performers. Outperformer on the day was once again tech. Had healthcare a little bit, slight outperformance, I guess we could call it, but really another tech driven day in markets. All right. Thank you, Josh. Mark, I also want to get your take here. Give me the technical take, Mark, on today's action. What do you see? Well, the biggest development, I think, was Nvidia hitting new all-time highs. I mean, it's 7% of the S&P, and certainly a big move. A lot of people thought it might stall out near that 153 level, and to get above that in my view is going to be positive in the days to come for both S&P and QQQ. So, uh, it's really about the move this week less than today. We saw a really good movement this week out of the financials, and the week being only Wednesday. So it's really been Monday, Tuesday. Remarkable outperformance in the last couple days out of Industrials, Financials, Transportation, and Consumer Discretionary. All sectors that had lagged into Monday of this week over the last month. Eight out of 11 sectors were down over the last month. Some to the extent almost two to three percent when you look at financials, industrials. That has all changed, folks, this week. So a very, very good recovery, very good signs out of that, a broadening out in this rally. Uh, many people get skeptical as indices hit new all-time highs, but honestly, that's the time you really got to pay attention. Sentiment remains offsides, and that's a key message. Until we see all these CTAs and hedge funds really start to pour money back into the market, uh, trends look great. The economy is good. Earnings are good.",

AI powerhouse Nvidia surging to an all-time high, pushing that company's market cap to about 3.77 trillion dollars. Now cements the company as one of the most valuable companies in the world. That stock grows about 4% to 15431. The record is only the latest milestone for the company has risen more than 60% off an April low. Recent earnings, strong sales were catalyst for bullish sentiment for the tech darling, but today's gains Nvidia stands as the world's largest stock. It was interesting, Mark, we were talking earlier the team at Loop Capital, they put out a note, maintain their buy, they took the target at 250 per Bloomberg. That's a street high, and they told their clients, Nvidia remains essentially a monopoly for critical tech, and it has pricing and margin power. I'm curious though when you look at the charts of Nvidia, what do the technicals tell you? Well, it's a new all-time high. It's very difficult to sell a stock like that. I mean, it's up 28% in the last three months, and actually, that's more than it's been up in the last year. So people were called the stock peaked out last summer and went sideways for a period of time, and that's a lot of these, you know, mag 7 fang stocks do, and then when they start to ascend again and break out to new highs, it generally pays to follow that move. And so, you know, my technical target is right around 165 and then 180. 250 for me would be aggressive, but I do sense that it can continue likely up into the month of August. Uh the fall might be a time when when generally market, you know, we might do we see some consolidation, but uh I don't see it yet. I I see that Nvidia is able to power the semiconductor sector. Now we have great results out of Micron, of course, what we discussed earlier, and AMD, they're all you know, surging in a way that really makes semis quite attractive here, and and I still love technology, so uh it's right to stick with it. All right, quite attractive. We'll leave it there. Thank you, Mark.",

Analysts cited not only concerns that the ceasefire between Iran and Israel could break down, but leaked US intelligence that said strikes had set back Tehran's nuclear program by just a few months. \"Maybe the US bombardment didn't destroy the Iran nuclear program,\" said Jack Ablin of Cresset Capital Management, adding that that revelations about the Iran nuclear program suggested the Iran story is not a \"new chapter.\" The S&P 500 finished a choppy day flat, while the Dow edged lower and the Nasdaq advanced. \"Investors are sort of catching their breath, since we had a very strong move on Monday and Tuesday,\" said Sam Stovall, chief investment officer at CFRA Research. \"Nvidia's on everyone lips today.\" The chip company shot up 4.3 percent to $154.31, giving it a market valuation of around $3.76 trillion -- more valuable than Microsoft, Apple and other tech giants. The rise came as CEO Jensen Huang\u00a0presented the company's latest technologies at Nvidia's annual meeting. Asian stock markets had closed higher earlier on Wednesday following rallies on Wall Street and in Europe the day before. But European stocks fell in Wednesday's session. Oil prices, meanwhile advanced after two days of heavy losses following a US crude inventory report that showed a bigger than expected drawdown in inventory. The dollar continued to slide against the euro, with fewer benefits from the flight to safety due to unrest in the Middle East. While the Israel-Iran conflict has dominated global attention in recent days, markets are also shifting attention back to trade. Shares of FedEx fell 3.3 percent after the shipping company did not provide a full-year forecast, citing uncertainty about the global trade outlook and tariffs. Dozens of countries are locked in negotiations with Washington to clinch some sort of trade deal to mitigate the impact of US tariffs. Only Britain has been reached a deal, although Beijing and Washington have agreed to lower tariffs from the highest rates they imposed upon one another. - Key figures at around 2040 GMT - Brent North Sea Crude: UP 0.8\u00a0percent at $67.68 per barrel West Texas Intermediate: UP 0.9 percent at $64.92 per barrel New York - Dow: DOWN 0.3 percent at 42,982.43 (close) New York - S&P 500: FLAT at\u00a06,092.16 (close) New York - Nasdaq Composite: UP\u00a00.3 percent at\u00a019,973.55 (close) London - FTSE 100: DOWN 0.5 percent at 8,718.75\u00a0(close) Paris - CAC 40: DOWN 0.8 percent at 7,558.16 (close) Frankfurt - DAX: DOWN 0.6 percent at 23,498.33 (close) Tokyo - Nikkei 225: UP 0.4 percent at 38,942.07\u00a0(close) Hong Kong - Hang Seng Index: UP 1.2 percent at 24,474.67 (close) Shanghai - Composite: UP 1.0 percent at 3,455.97 (close) Euro/dollar: UP at $1.1656 from $1.1609 on Tuesday Pound/dollar: UP at $1.3664 from $1.3615 Dollar/yen: UP at 145.32 yen from 144.94 yen Euro/pound: DOWN at 85.26 from 85.27 pence burs-jmb/des",

        "content": "Micron's (MU)third quarter earnings resultsbeat estimates; in particular, its data center sales surged on artificial intelligence (AI) demand. Cory Johnson, Epistrophy Capital Research chief market strategist and host of \"The Drill Down\" podcast, joins Market Domination Overtime to explain what's driving Micron's growth. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Dominationhere. Let's get some more reaction to Micron earnings. Joining us now is Corey Johnson, chief market strategist at Epistrophe Capital Research and host of the Drill Down podcast. Corey, Micron reports, at least initially, investors like what they see. The stock is surging in the after-hours. But give me your your initial take, Corey, on on the report. I have to tell you when I was looking at my model over the weekend, I thought, I must be insane to be looking over nine billion in revenue. What am I doing wrong here? And I look, and they put up this print of over $9 billion in revenue, $9.3 billion in revenue. And it was driven by the things that I I wrote about in my previous note, Joshua sent you as well, which is talking about high bandwidth memory, talking about sales into the data center. We knew that they were sold out going into the quarter. But the nature of the way they were sold out and what they were selling was so interesting. This high bandwidth memory, it is not only different than DRAM of old, uh right now, you know, so if you want to think about it in a very basic way, it's like stacking up pancakes of memory, all working on top of each other, and then then stacked up really close to the GPU. Used to be memory was sort of more dispersed on a circuit board. And it allows a GPU in a data center to access a lot more memory at any given moment, and it allows the work of both inference and training and inference to happen uh in the data center of an AI model. And they're selling this stuff like pancakes, like hotcakes, right? I don't really know what a hotcake is. Joshua might. But I um they're selling these things like crazy, and they're selling them out, and they're selling them at better and better margins. And and it's a really impressive product. What's curious, and I'll be listening in the conference call to hear, are any hints that they might have a lasting advantage here? So, traditionally, what we've seen from Micron is selling kind of the same product as their two big competitors in Hynix and Samsung. But with high bandwidth memory, and to be clear, uh they weren't the first ones out there with high bandwidth memory, but they seem to be leading and growing market share. And the question here is, are there process advantages that they have that can last for a while to help them grow even faster than the market, and indeed, some IP advantages? That's what we're listening for. And and Corey and and Josh, I just want to mention some other numbers are in the press release around what Corey is talking about here. So, the company said it saw an all-time high in DRAM revenue. That's dynamic random access memory. That includes the high bandwidth memory sub category that we're talking about, which saw 50% sequential growth, data center revenue more than doubling, which and with that a quarterly record. But I think, Corey, to your point, the real question here is whether what was this fundamentally commoditized business that was very cyclical, whether it has changed over the long term, whether it's sort of muted but still in effect, right? You know, how how much has this sort of changed the calculus? We saw how much it changed the calculus for Nvidia. I mean, most semiconductor companies were sort of cyclical and commoditized. Um and and we're seeing that become less so. So, I guess we just have to figure out if if Micron's going to fall into that category. And also what they can charge for it, right? Can they charge their customers so much more because they are sold out? Are they looking at the long term? I mean Micron has never gone below above 60% margins. I think their all-time record is something like 59.5, 59.4 or something. Uh and indeed, in my modeling of this company, I'm trying to figure out, can they get to a higher number here? Do they, knowing the cyclicality of semiconductors, and no one knows that more than Micron, can they, in fact, start to take more profit from their customers, or do they risk the chance of pissing off their customers and not wanting to make that that decision? Now, Nvidia has decided to take margins of better than 70% in a business that was once barely profitable. Let's see if Micron next who decides to do that, and again, what we hear in the conference call, but this is such an exciting time to cover enterprise technology, and the fact that Micron, which used to make just boring DRAM in the heart of Idaho, is is now um making such an interesting product and such a technologically advanced product in high bandwidth memory, it just shows what an exciting time um uh AI has given us uh in this in this moment in enterprise tech.",

        "content": "The Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) hit an all-time high Wednesday for the second straight session as tech stocks continued to rally. The fund, which tracks theNasdaq 100index, lost around a quarter of its value between mid-February and early April, dragged down by concerns overbig tech\u2019s significant AI spendingand uncertainty over the economic impact of President Trump\u2019s \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs.\u00a0The ETF has recovered all of those loses as concerns about trade policy have subsided and corporate earnings have been generally strong. The QQQ gained 0.3% to close Wednesday's session at around $541. The fund is now up 6% since the start of 2025. Below, we break down thetechnicalson QQQ's chart to identify price levels that investors will likely be watching. After gapping above thenecklineof aninverse head and shouldersformation last month, the QQQ fund continued trending higher before consolidating within a flag pattern just below its record high. The fund broke out from theflagin Tuesday\u2019s trading session, paving the way for a further move higher. Meanwhile, yesterday\u2019s bullishprice actioncoincided with an uptick in therelative strength index, though the indicator remains belowoverboughtlevels, providing ample room for the ETF to continue its uptrend. Let\u2019s applytechnical analysisto QQQ\u2019s chart to project overheadprice targetsand also identify two crucialsupport levelsworth monitoring during retracements. Investors can project an overhead price target by using the bars pattern tool. When applying this technique to QQQ\u2019s chart, we extract the price bars comprising the fund\u2019s move higher following thebreakoutfrom the head and shoulders formation and overlay them from the flag pattern\u2019s breakout point. This projects a target of around $575. The measured move technique, also known as themeasuring principle, analyzes chart patterns to project future price movements. When applying this analysis, we calculate the distance of the inverse head and shoulders from bottom to top inpointsand add that amount to the formation\u2019s neckline. For instance, we add $92 to $494, which forecasts a target of $586. A retracement in the fund could see an initial retest of support around $524. This area may attract buying interest near the base of the flag pattern and a period ofconsolidationthat formed on the chart throughout late May. Finally, a decisive close below this level could lead to a retest of lower support at $494. Investors may seek toaccumulateQQQ shares in this location near the inverse head and shoulders' neckline, which also doubles as ahorizonal linethat connects a series of trading activity on the chart extending back to last September.

        "content": "Major U.S. equities indexes were mixed in the midweek session as the truce between Iran and Israel appeared to hold steady, with President Donald Trump indicating that the U.S. would hold meetings with Iran next week. Investors were also monitoring the second day of testimony in Congress from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who emphasized the need for the central bank to account for the possibility of persistent inflation related to U.S. tariff policies. The S&P 500 was essentially flat on Wednesday, ending a fraction of a point below the previous session's closing level and remaining just below its all-time high. The Dow slipped 0.3%, while the Nasdaq closed 0.3% higher. Shares of artificial intelligence semiconductor behemoth Nvidia (NVDA) jumped 4.3%, lifting the stock to itshighest-ever closeand returning the company to the top spot in the list of the world's most valuable companies by market capitalization. Wednesday's gains came as Bank of America analysts highlighted Nvidia's leadership in the AI market, while Loop Capital analysts raised their price target on Nvidia stock, forecasting an oncoming \"golden wave\" in the adoption of generative AI technology. Paychex (PAYX) shares dropped 9.4%, losing the most of any S&P 500 stock, after the payroll and human resources services provider reportedlower-than-expected salesfor its fiscal fourth quarter. Although revenue was up 10% from the year-ago period, the majority of those gains stemmed from the acquisition of human capital management, or HCM, software firm Paycor, which closed in April. Paychex also provided full-year sales and profit guidance that came in below consensus estimates. Shares of fellow HCM software providers Paycom (PAYC), Dayforce (DAY) and Automatic Data Processing (ADP) were all down more than 4%. Cereal maker General Mills (GIS) missed fiscal fourth-quarter sales estimates and projected alarger-than-anticipated profit declinein fiscal 2026, and its shares fell 5.1%. A decline in the company's North America Retail segment weighed on its results. The parent company of Cheerios and Bisquick baking mix anticipates that the uncertain macroeconomic environment will continue to affect consumers. CEO Jeff Harmening said General Mills intends to focus on reinvigorating volume-driven organic sales growth. Tesla (TSLA)\u00a0stock slipped 3.8% after the the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association reported that the automaker's new car registrations in the European Union were down more than 40% year-over-year in May. This marked afifth straight month of declinesfor Tesla in the region, even as overall battery electric vehicle registrations have consistently moved higher. Super Micro Computer (SMCI)\u00a0shares soared 8.8%, logging the top daily performance in the S&P 500. With Wednesday's gains, the stock clawed back the steep losses posted earlier in the week after the server maker announced a plan to issue$2 billion in convertible notes. Although news of the offering raised concerns about potential share dilution, Supermicro said it would dedicate part of the proceeds to capped call transactions designed to mitigate the dilutive impact. Northern Trust (NTRS) stock advanced 4.8%, extending gains posted earlier this week following news that Bank of New York Mellon (BK) had approached the smaller wealth and asset management firm about a potential merger. Additional reports Wednesday indicated that talks between the two companies have been occurring for months, suggesting that negotiations may be further along than previously believed, although Northern Trust has said that it is committed to remaining independent.",

        "content": "Wednesday, June 25, 2025Markets look to have grown fairly exhausted today, sliding from the green to red during the morning hours and closing flat-to-down (aside from the Nasdaq, where the tech trade remains healthy) and reaching the closing bell at lackluster levels. The Dow slipped 106 points, -0.25%, while the S&P 500 was exactly unched \u2014 0.0% \u2014 on the day. The Nasdaq gained +61 points, +0.31%, while the small-cap Russell 2000 closed at session lows: -0.99%.The morning-hours catalyst may have been Fed Chair Jerome Powell today, appearing before the Senate Banking Committee to discuss the possibility of cutting interest rates. Yesterday, Powell energized markets somewhat when he told the House Financial Services that the Fed could cut rates \u201csooner than later,\u201d but today he predicted inflation coming from tariff policy in the coming months. \u201cSomeone has to pay,\u201d he told the panel.Yet the Nasdaq is approaching fresh all-time highs not seen since February, as the AI-trade narrative has kept top tech stocks buoyant. TakeNVIDIANVDA, for instance, which is up nearly +64% just since its early April lows during trade war fears before reciprocal tariffs were paused for 90 days. Shares are now at record highs as AI investment reported by companies in various industries are engaged in the technological buildout for which NVIDIA leads in component-building. Fiscal Q3 earnings were released after today\u2019s close from data storage giantMicronMU. This company is a good example of how AI investment bolsters companies in this realm of the tech space, as well. Earnings of $1.68 per share outpaced the Zacks consensus by 9 cents, up a whopping +171% year over year. Revenues of $9.30 billion easily surpassed the $8.84 billion analysts were looking for.Bot only that, but Micron raised guidance fairly significantly for its fiscal Q4: earnings of between $2.35-2.65 per share is well ahead of the $2.02 consensus, with between $10.4-11.0 billion in revenues far beyond the $9.9 billion previously projected. As such, expect this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold)-based stock to ratchet up a bit in the days to come. Shares had already been up +51.2% year to date, and are up another +4% in late trading. (You can see the full Zacks Earnings Calendar here. https://www.zacks.com/earnings/earnings-calendar)  We have a full plate of economic reports before tomorrow\u2019s opening bell, with a new Trade Balance in Goods, Retail/Wholesale Inventories, Durable Goods and Pending Home Sales all accompanying the second revision to Q1 GDP. But what we\u2019ll be paying extra close attention to tomorrow are the Weekly Jobless Claims.Initial Jobless Claims touched 250K a couple weeks ago, second only to the 259K reported back in early October of last year (which appears like an anomalous blip on the screen). They came back down to 245K in last week\u2019s report, and we hope to see this continue downward.Continuing Claims, reported a week in arrears from new claims, clearly look they are breaking out to new levels. After spending much of 2025 chopping back and forth between 1.85-1.9 million, the past two weeks have shot up to a new range around 1.95 million. If this comes back down we won\u2019t make too much of it. But touching that 2 million level on longer-term jobless claims will have a psychological effect on markets \u2014 and perhaps the Fed as well.Questions or comments about this article and/or author?

The Wall Street Journalreportedlate Wednesday that the president's frustration with Powell's \"wait and see\" approach to interest rates has led him to consider announcing his pick to succeed the Fed chair in September or October.
