        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) stocks drove market gains last year, and this doesn't apply only to the tech-heavyNasdaq Composite. Even theDow Jones Industrial Averagegot a boost from AI asNvidiaposted the biggest gain in the index -- the AI chip leader soared more than 170%. Though momentum paused earlier this year amid concerns about economic growth, it's since picked up steam again on strong earnings reports andcapital spending forecastsfrom AI companies. And the long-term outlook remains bright, with analysts predicting the AI market will top $2 trillion by the early 2030s. All of this means now is a great time to invest in companies that are benefiting from this growth as well as those that are positioned to benefit down the road. To do this, you could select a few individual stocks, but with this move alone, your opportunity for gains is tied to the prospects of only these players. If you add the following asset to your portfolio, though, you could supercharge your winning power. My prediction is this new exchange-traded fund (ETF) -- involving star analyst Dan Ives -- could be the best way to invest in the AI revolution. Let's find out more. Image source: Getty Images. First a quick note about why investors are so excited about AI and what to expect from the technology. AIcould help companiesgain in efficiency, lower costs, and more quickly develop new and better products and services. The technology also may help us in our daily lives with routine tasks and more -- we're already seeing this through AI-powered assistants on our smartphones thanks to companies such asMeta PlatformsandAlphabet. And, as mentioned, all of this is set to create a trillion-dollar market. Right now, companies are ramping up AI infrastructure needed for this revolution, but they've also started applying AI to real world problems -- and we should see more of this in the near future as this phase of \"AI agents\" takes off. All of this may be only the beginning of this vast opportunity as AI giant Nvidia says humanoid robots could be a growth driver down the road. So, to benefit from the AI boom, it's a great idea to invest across players involved in various aspects of the technology as well as today's winners and tomorrow's potential winners. You can do that through theDan IVES Wedbush AI Revolution ETF(IVES0.85%), which just launched a few days ago. You mayrecognize the nameDan Ives as this Wedbush analyst often shares his views and research on technology stocks across social media as well as in various traditional media interviews. Ives has championed the potential of AI and understands which companies are well-positioned to win. Thanks to the new Ives ETF, this top analyst's knowledge now can work for you. The Ives ETF invests in 30 players across AI industries, from those involved in the development of infrastructure to those applying AI to business. The fund is built around Ives' proprietary research, identifying the most compelling players at the heart of the AI spending cycle , according to Wedbush. Microsoft,Nvidia, andBroadcomare the top three holdings in this $59 million fund, each with weightings of more than 5%. But, as promised, you'll find a variety of players such as voice AI specialistSoundHound AIand AI-driven cloud security companyZscaler. One quick practical and very important note: When investing in ETFs be aware that they come with management fees expressed asan expense ratio. Always choose ones with a ratio of less than 1% to maximize your potential for gains. The Ives ETF fits our criteria, with an expense ratio is 0.75%. So, as mentioned, you could pick stocks as a way to potentially score an AI victory, and that's a great idea. But you may not want to stop there. My prediction is the best way to win in this revolution is broad exposure to a wide range of strong companies involved in the space -- and you'll get this with the new Wedbush ETF, supercharged by Dan Ives' solid research.",

        "content": "When it comes to artificial intelligence (AI) chip stocks, names such asNvidia,Broadcom,Advanced Micro Devices, andTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturingdominate the talking points among financial circles. These companies are at the forefront of designing and manufacturing advanced chipsets known as graphics processing units (GPUs). While investing in semiconductor stocks has generally been a great idea over the last two years, the stocks above have taken a bit of a breather during 2025. Uncertainty around tariff negotiations and particularly exposure to China have investors trimming their gains and looking elsewhere for now. One opportunity that has emerged as a new favorite among chip stocks isCoreWeave(CRWV15.65%), which went public back in March. Since the initial public offering, shares of CoreWeave have rocketed by 251% as of the closing bell on June 6. Is now the time to get in on the CoreWeave trade, or is the company quickly becoming Wall Street's next bigmeme stock? For the last couple of years, investors could not stop buying chip design and manufacturing stocks. And to be completely honest, I think companies such as Nvidia, AMD, Broadcom, and Taiwan Semi all have bright futures. For instance, global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company recently reported thatnearly $7 trillion could be allocated toward AI infrastructure spendover the next five years. Within these capital expenditures, the largest allocation is forecast to go toward hardware for AI data centers. These secular tailwinds may be justified by ongoing infrastructure initiatives such asProject Stargatehere in the U.S. as well as similar buildouts overseas -- particularlyacross the Middle East. While this is all great for Nvidia and its peers, why are investors flocking to CoreWeave as of late? My thinking is that the company's unique business model is becoming increasingly favored among chip stock investors. Allow me to explain. CoreWeave offers an infrastructure services business in which customers can access clusters of Nvidia GPUs among other architectures via the cloud. This is an interesting model, as it essentially allows generative AI developers an efficient way to access the industry's best hardware without needing to directly order it, wait for the chips to be manufactured, and then work with integrated systems designers to build custom training and inferencing clusters. Image source: Getty Images. At the end of the first quarter (March 31), CoreWeave boasted $14.7 billion inremaining performance obligationsplus another $11.2 billion in committed contracts from a strategic deal signed with OpenAI. Given the company has roughly $25.9 billion in backlog, let's see how quickly Wall Street thinks CoreWeave can recognize this growth.  CRWV Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Yeardata byYCharts In the chart above, investors can see that the general consensus among analysts is for CoreWeave to roughly triple its revenue over the next two years as well as transition to a profitable business. Overall, I'd say this is a bright picture. However, CoreWeave's valuation suggests that most (if not all) of this good news is priced into the stock already.  CRWV PS Ratiodata byYCharts Not only is CoreWeave'sprice-to-salesratio far higher than more mature and diversified data center infrastructure businesses such asOracleandVertiv, but the company's multiple continues to expand. I see the appeal of investing in infrastructure services businesses as part of the broader AI equation. But right now, CoreWeave is experiencing outsized levels ofvaluation expansion-- leaving little to no room for error when it comes to an investment. Said differently, buying a stock at record levels requires a high conviction that the price will continue rising. While that may well be the case for CoreWeave in the long run, I think investing in the company at its current price isn't prudent.Investing in momentum stockscan be a risky strategy, and to me, I would not be surprised to see CoreWeave's price normalize sooner than later. The bright side is that if CoreWeave shares begin to show some weakness, that could be an opportunity for smart investors to buy the dip. So while I think CoreWeave could be a winner in the long run, I think there are more reasonable opportunities to buy the stock as opposed to right now. For the time being, I do see CoreWeave exhibiting some characteristics of a meme stock, and I think shares are best left avoided.",

According to The Quantum Insider, the company has introduced the Omega quantum photonic chipset, designed for utility-scale quantum computing, featuring high-performance photonic components. Additionally, PsiQuantum has developed high-speed optical switches and improved photon detectors to enhance quantum circuit performance. To boost efficiency, PsiQuantum implemented a compilation technique known as active volume compilation, aiming to reduce application run times by approximately 50-fold, The Quantum Insider says. BlackRock, which led PsiQuantum's previous $450 million round, is returning as lead investor, signaling sustained institutional confidence. According to San Francisco Business Times, other major backers include Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) venture arm M12,Atomico,Founders Fund,Playground Global,Temasek Holdings, andFPV Ventures. According toThe Information, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is in advanced discussions to invest in PsiQuantum, signaling a strategic shift in its quantum computing approach.

In January, Huang rocked the sector by suggesting quantum computers were at least 20 years from viability, sending quantum-related stocks tumbling. But just weeks later, during Nvidia's \u201cQuantum Day\u201d at its GTC conference in San Jose, California, Huang reversed course, admitting his earlier comments were off the mark, according toCNBC. That shift helped reignite interest in companies like PsiQuantum, which now stand to benefit from the renewed optimism and visibility. While competitors such as Google, IBM (NYSE:IBM), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Honeywell (NASDAQ:HON), and Rigetti Computing (NASDAQ:RGTI) continue to push their own quantum architectures, PsiQuantum's photonic approach is seen by many as a promising alternative, San Francisco Business Times says. PsiQuantum\u2019s funding round reflects growing investor confidence in the company\u2019s photonic quantum computing technology. The company\u2019s innovative approach may position it as a key player in the race to develop practical quantum computing solutions.

        "content": "Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares will likely remain in focus after hitting their highest level since January on Monday, lifted by optimism thattrade discussions between the U.S. and China could lead to reduced export curbs. Chipmakers rallied after White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said onCNBCearly Monday that officials from Washington and Beijing intended to discuss the release of rare earth minerals to the U.S. and the expansion of Chinese access to American-made semiconductors duringtalks between the two countries taking place in London this week. In April, AMD cautioned its results would be affected bycharges of roughly $800 million related to tightening restrictions on sales of its chips to China, while rival AI behemoth (NVDIA) warned it would take a potential $5.5 billion charge related to limits on exports of its H20 chip. AMD shares gained nearly 5% on Monday to close at around $122. The stock has risen nearly 60% from its early April-low, putting it back to where it started 2025, as investors assess whether the company can make further inroads into the booming AI chip market. Investors will learn more about AMD's plans for artificial intelligence at the company's \"Advancing AI\" event on Thursday, which features a keynote address from CEO Lisa Su.

Domestic firms could resort to means such as chip packaging or stacking to achieve results similar to that from advanced semiconductor technology. The Huawei founder also expressed confidence in the interview that China can make breakthroughs in AI and software, particularly in an increasingly open-source environment. The US has put restrictions on chip design programs for Chinese firms, though Washington could also remove those pending the outcome of talks. The prominently placed article appears timed to coincide with a second day of sensitive negotiations between the US and China, which are seeking to ease tensions over shipments of technology and rare earth elements. US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick\u2019s presence at the talks underscore the importance that export controls are playing in these discussions. Lutnick has said China isn\u2019t capable of producing high volumes of sophisticated semiconductors, a sign American export controls are limiting its progress. Nvidia CEO Warns That Chinese AI Rivals Are Now \u2018Formidable\u2019 Semiconductor packaging or stacking refers to the techniques of bundling chips together to make them more powerful - Huawei has been relying on this method to make its most powerful AI chips at Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., aiming to develop silicon as sophisticated as what Nvidia Corp. offers. In May, Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said that Chinese AI rivals are filling the void left by the departure of US companies from that market, and their technology is becoming more powerful. But Ren also acknowledged Huawei\u2019s current limits in his comments. \u201cThe US has made exaggerations about Huawei\u2019s achievements. Huawei is not that good yet,\u201d Ren said. \u201cWe are still lagging one-generation behind the US in terms of output from a single chip, though we can still get the results we want by compensating with cluster-based computing.\u201d Cluster-based computing is a reference to running AI training on a group of chips. Huawei has in past years evolved from a telecom gear and smartphone maker into one of China\u2019s national tech champions, making advances in semiconductors, EVs and AI. It\u2019s also one of Washington\u2019s biggest targets, given persistent accusations of its ties to Beijing. The company has repeatedly stressed it\u2019s an employee-run company. Ren, a former People\u2019s Liberation Army officer, has emerged as one of the tech sector\u2019s most prominent voices since the first Trump administration added the company to the so-called Entity List. That move significantly curtailed Huawei\u2019s access to US technologies, initially walloped the business and sped its exit from several major markets. But Huawei has since regained market share in smartphones, developed a more advanced processor than the US thought possible, and is now making inroads into the AI and EV software markets. --With assistance from Mackenzie Hawkins.

        "header": "Best $3 Trillion Stock to Buy Right Now: Apple, Microsoft, or Nvidia?",
        "content": "The $3 trillion stock club isn't a big list; it's justNvidia(NVDA-0.21%),Microsoft(MSFT-0.27%), andApple(AAPL0.69%).Amazon(AMZN-0.19%)is the fourth-largest company in the world, but it is currently valued at around $2.2 trillion, which showcases how large a gap there is between third and fourth place. Of this $3 trillion trio, is there any worth owning right now? After all, they're already quite large; could they get even bigger? Image source: Getty Images. Apple and Microsoft are easily the most recognizable companies of this trio. Many people use Apple products daily, whether it's an iPhone or some other hardware Apple creates. Microsoft is similar, as many people utilize one of the Microsoft Office products at work. However, Microsoft is a much broader company than that, as its variouscloud computing productsmake up a significant amount of the company's revenue. Nvidia is even more obscure, as few people interact with the bulk of Nvidia's products. You may have an Nvidia graphics card in your laptop or PC, but the bulk of Nvidia's revenue comes from its data centergraphics processing units (GPUs), which have been widely deployed to train and run AI models. Nvidia has a dominant hold on this market, with most estimates stating that Nvidia's market share is greater than 90%. These three businesses have dominated their respective industries, which makes sense, as only the best rise to the top. However, I think these three companies will take very different paths over the next five years, with one company clearly being the best buy. From a revenue standpoint, Apple is the largest company, but that gap closes when profits are considered.  AAPL Revenue (TTM)data byYCharts However, one notable thing is that Nvidia is still significantly smaller than the other two, despite being the largest company in the world currently. That's because Nvidia has one thing that the others don't: growth. Although Nvidia's growth has started to slow a bit, it's still incredibly rapid.  AAPL Operating Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth)data byYCharts Next quarter also looks promising for Nvidia, with revenue expected to rise 50% year over year. Part of this slowdown can be attributed to the U.S. government banning exports to China of its H20 chip, which was specially designed to meet old regulations. Still, 50% growth is nothing to be worried about, as it showcases the strong demand for Nvidia's products. Demand for Nvidia's products is expected to persist. Third-party estimates stated that data center buildouts reached $400 billion last year but will rise to $1 trillion by 2028. Should that occur, Nvidia's growth will continue to be rapid and far outpace Microsoft and Apple. This makes Nvidia my top pick moving forward, but Microsoft isn't a bad option either, as the demand for its cloud computing servers, thanks to AI, is also booming. Apple is the only stock I'd be worried about owning from this trio. It is barely growing and hasn't showcased the ability to release an innovative product for some time. Despite this, it still doesn't trade at much of a discount to the other two from aforward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratiostandpoint.  AAPL PE Ratio (Forward)data byYCharts With how slow Apple is expected to grow (Wall Street analysts estimate 4.1% revenue growth in fiscal year 2025 and 5.9% in fiscal year 2026), I'd argue that Apple deserves no more than a market-average premium. With theS&P 500trading at 22.4 times forward earnings, Apple could have a long way to fall before trading at that level. Over the next five years, I project that Nvidia will massively outperform the market, Microsoft will slightly beat it, and Apple will underperform. Nvidia's growth is unprecedented, and it could propel it tobecome the first $5 trillion company.",

        "header": "Better Hypergrowth Stock: Rigetti Computing vs. CoreWeave",
        "content": "Rigetti Computing(RGTI4.86%)andCoreWeave(CRWV-6.69%)both look like exciting growth plays for investors who can tolerate a lot of risk. Rigetti is an early mover in the quantum computing market, and CoreWeave is one of the market's fastest-growing artificial intelligence (AI) companies. Over the past 12 months, Rigetti's stock gained more than 970%. CoreWeave, which went public in March, has already soared about 250% from its IPO price of $40. Should you chase either of these high-flying hypergrowth tech stocks today? Image source: Getty Images. Rigetti provides quantum processing units (QPUs), full quantum systems, and a cloud-based platform for developingquantum applications. That makes it a one-stop shop for quantum computing solutions, and it has been expanding its menu of offerings with cheaper commercial systems and modular systems that link together multiple systems. Classical computers store and process data in binary bits: zeros and ones. Quantum computers use a different paradigm that takes advantage of the peculiarities of quantum mechanics: They use qubits, which can be ones or zeroes, but can also have values that are probability amplitudes -- complex weighted combinations of those zero and one states. As an investor, you don\u2019t need to understand how it works: What matters is that using qubits to process calculations allows quantum computers to quickly get answers to some unusual types of problems that would take years or even centuries for classical supercomputers to solve. The downsides are that quantum computers are bigger, pricier, and consume much more power. Also, because qubits are finicky and fragile, outside interference can flip their states. As a result, today's quantum computers produce errors once every few hundred operations, vastly more often than traditional computers, whose ratios are measured in errors per billion or trillion operations. To make quantum computing technology truly useful, its error rates will have to come down to magnitudes of one in a million or better. Rigetti's big customers include the Superconducting Quantum Materials and Systems Center, the Air Force Research Lab, and the Horizon Quantum Computing in Singapore. Its recent product launches include its smaller 9-qubit Novera QPU for commercial customers and its 84-qubit Ankaa 3 quantum system for government and research clients. It plans to launch a new modular system, which connects four of its 9-qubit systems to create a 36-qubit system, later this year. It aims to launch a non-modular 100-qubit system in 2026. Rigetti's revenue declined by 8% in 2023 and another 10% in 2024, mainly due to its lack of new R&D milestone payments and the uneven timing of payments from its government and research contracts. The company's net loss also widened from $75 million in 2023 to $201 million in 2024. But from 2024 to 2027, analysts expect its revenue to grow at a compound annual rate of 52% from $10.8 million to $37.7 million, and expect it to narrow its net loss to $85.4 million. That acceleration should be driven by more commercial contracts and even more powerful systems. But with a market cap of $3.3 billion currently, Rigetti already trades at 87 times its estimated sales for 2027. It might eventually grow into that valuation if it scales up its business and its quantum systems become more widely adopted for mainstream computing applications, but that valuation bubble could also burst if it fails to meet Wall Street's high expectations. That might be why company insiders sold five times as many shares as they bought over the past 12 months. CoreWeave was founded as anEthereum-mining business in 2017, but it abandoned that market after the cryptocurrency crash of 2018. The company then repurposed its crypto-mining GPUs (graphics processing units) to powerAI taskson its new cloud infrastructure platform, which it significantly expanded with a $100 million purchase ofNvidia's H100 GPUs in 2022. CoreWeave then leveraged its GPUs as collateral to secure even more funding, and it attracted some big investments from Nvidia,Cisco, andPureStorage. That support helped the company expand from just three AI data centers at the end of 2022 to 33 such locations across the U.S. and Europe today. It claims its dedicated GPU approach makes it roughly 35 times faster and 80% cheaper for tackling AI tasks than traditional cloud platforms, and its top customers already include AI leaders likeMicrosoftand OpenAI. As CoreWeave opened more data centers to meet the growing demand in the AI space, its revenue surged from $16 million in 2022 to $1.92 billion in 2024. However, its net loss widened from $31 million in 2022 to $863 million in 2024 as it bought and leased more data centers, bought more GPUs from Nvidia, and dealt with higher energy costs. From 2024 to 2027, analysts expect CoreWeave's revenue to soar at a compound annual rate of 105% to $16.55 billion, and expect it to narrow its net loss to $747 million. That's an impressive growth trajectory, but soaring expenses and high debt could throttle long-term expansion. It could also face fresh competition as bigger cloud platforms roll out more dedicated AI services. With a market cap of $67.3 billion, CoreWeave seems more reasonably valued than Rigetti at 4 times its estimated sales for 2027. But when its lockup period expires on Sept. 24, a lot of its insiders could rush to sell and take profits on the high-flying stock. Rigetti might have a bright future as the quantum computing market expands, but its business is still wobbly and it is trading at meme stock valuations. CoreWeave is also risky, but it's growing faster and its valuations look more reasonable. So if I could only pick one of these hypergrowth stocks today, I'd choose CoreWeave.",

        "header": "3 Monster Stocks -- including Nvidia -- to Hold for the Next 10 Years",
        "content": "TheS&P 500indextracks the stock performance of America's biggest companies, and it hasaveraged annual gains of roughly 10%over multiple decades. That's pretty darn good performance, enough to more than quintuple an investment over 15 years for those who purchased exchange-traded funds (ETFs) mirroring the index. Some individual stocks, though, have done better than that -- much better. Image source: Getty Images. In the table below, you'll see that the S&P 500 has been growing at a much faster rate over the past 15 years compared to its long-term 10% average. That outsized performance is due, in part, to the eye-popping average annual gains of some of its components, including what some might label as monster stocks, that have managed monster performances. Average Annual Return Stock 5 Years 10 Years 15 Years SPDR S&P 500 ETF(SPY0.15%) 14.85% 12.90% 14.18% Nvidia(NVDA0.72%) 73.46% 73.83% 50.57% Intuitive Surgical(ISRG-5.58%) 23.08% 26.07% 20.03% Microsoft(MSFT0.48%) 20.78% 26.64% 21.75% Data source: Morningstar.com as of June 6, 2025. These kinds of returns are not guaranteed to continue. Manydynamically growing companiessee their growth rates slow as they become massive companies. But a select few manage to keep up that outsized growth. Here's a closer look at three companies with this potential and some reasons why you might want to buy and/or keep holding any of them. Nvidia got its start as a maker ofsemiconductor chipsfor the videogame industry, but it has expanded its scope in the past decade. A side hustle into chip design catered to aid cryptocurrency mining has led to the development of chips and software that are now fueling theartificial intelligence(AI) boom, and it ischurning out gobs of chipsfor data centers -- enough to bethe world's leading supplierof graphics processing units for the data centers used in cloud computing. Data centers have replaced gaming as Nvidia's focus, and the company raked in $39 billion in revenue in fiscal 2026's first quarter from its data center business -- fully 89% of total revenue. Better still, CEO Jensen Huang forecasts that AI infrastructure spending could top $1trillionannually within a few years, and he sees Nvidia capturing most of that business. Despite the monster performance over the past several years, Nvidia stock doesn't appear to be wildly overvalued at recent levels. Its recentforward-looking price-to-earnings (P/E) ratioof 33, for example, is well below the five-year average of 40.Consider buying Nvidiato hold for the next 10 years or more to take advantage of this forecasted growth. Intuitive Surgical is another strong stock performer, though it's not as attractively valued as Nvidia lately. Its forward P/E was recently at a steep 72, well above the five-year average of 56 (which is steep as well). Sothink twice before buying at these levelsand look for opportunities to buy on the dip. But if you already own the stock, you might want to hold on. Intuitive Surgical isa leader in robotic surgery equipment. It has more than 8,600 of its million-dollar-plus da Vinci robotic surgery systems installed in 71 countries. Together, they've been used to perform more than 14 million medical procedures. I'm a shareholder and I'm hanging on because I expect the company to keep selling and installing surgical systems, andto keep raking in profitsfrom doing so. Notably, Intuitive Surgical derives 84% of its revenue not from the systems themselves, but from dependable recurring sales of servicing, supplies, and accessories for the machines. Microsoft is a tech giant with many growing operations contributing to its steady growth. It's home to the dominant Office 365 suite of applications, the Azure cloud computing platform, the Xbox gaming platform, the Windows operating system, and even the business-oriented social media giant LinkedIn, among other ventures. Microsoft is huge (its market value hovers around $3.5 trillion), but it's still growing at a fairly rapid clip, with some of its recent growth largely attributable to its AI-related ventures. In its third quarter of fiscal 2025, revenue was up by 13% year over year, and net income rose by 18%. Itsintelligent cloud division grew by 21%. The company is generating more cash than it needs to spend on growth, so it'spaying shareholders a dividendthat recently yielded 0.71%. (That might not seem like a lot, but the yield is pushed down because of strong share price performance and the dividend is growing briskly -- up from $2.09 per share in 2020 to $3.24 per share currently.) Despite the strong share price performance, its stock remains appealingly valued, too, with a recent forward P/E of 31 only a bit above the five-year average of 30. Given the steady growth, the stock seems well worth hanging on to for the next decade -- and beyond.",

        "content": "Chicago, IL \u2013 June 10, 2025 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Palantir Technologies Inc. PLTR, Nvidia NVDA and Oracle ORCL. Palantir Technologies Inc.has surged 69% year to date, eclipsing the industry\u2019s modest 13% average and outshining heavyweights likeNvidiaandOracle. Nvidia, a leading force in AI and graphics processing technology, has recorded a 6% gain so far this year. Similarly, Oracle, renowned for its enterprise software and cloud infrastructure services, has gained 5% year to date. In a macroeconomic landscape that has left many tech giants limping, Palantir\u2019s relentless rally stands out, but does this pace leave any meaningful upside for new investors? While Nvidia continues wrestling with cyclical demand and Oracle faces pressure on its cloud transition pace, Palantir is thriving by doubling down on artificial intelligence and data-centric enterprise software. The key question now: Is this AI darling still a buy, or has the market already priced in perfection? The backbone of Palantir\u2019s recent success is its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), which is rapidly transforming into the company\u2019s biggest commercial catalyst. U.S. commercial revenues skyrocketed 71% year over year and 19% sequentially in the first quarter of 2025, pushing the annual run rate past the $1 billion mark for the first time. Total contract value in this segment skyrocketed 239% YoY, with deal sizes proliferating, more than double the number of $1 million contracts closed compared to last year. The rising popularity of AIP bootcamps \u2014 short, targeted training sessions for enterprise AI deployment \u2014 is a major driver. These bootcamps reduce implementation timelines and showcase AIP\u2019s plug-and-play value, helping customers scale AI operations faster than ever. Palantir\u2019s flexible, modular sales model allows clients to start small with specific components, further lowering adoption friction. Combined with usage-based pricing, this strategy has broadened Palantir\u2019s reach in the U.S. commercial sector, making AI integration more accessible and scalable for new clients. As of March 31, 2025, Palantir boasted $5.4 billion in cash and no debt. This fortress balance sheet gives the company strategic flexibility to reinvest in growth without external financing pressures. Revenue growth remains robust\u2014first quarter sales soared 39.3% YoY. Deal momentum is equally encouraging with Palantir closing 139 deals of at least $1 million, 51 deals of at least $5 million and 31 deals of at least $10 million in the quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter 2025 EPS stands at 14 cents, up 55.6% from a year ago. Full-year earnings are projected to grow 44% in 2025 and 25% in 2026. Sales estimates are equally bullish, with 38% expected growth in the second quarter and full-year top-line increases of 37% and 28% for 2025 and 2026, respectively. Despite its strong fundamentals, PLTR\u2019s valuation is hard to ignore. Its forward P/E ratio of 197 dwarfs the industry average of 40. This lofty premium reflects high expectations around future AI monetization and government contracts. While the growth story is compelling, the stock is priced for near-flawless execution, leaving minimal margin for error. Such a valuation exposes the stock to heightened volatility, especially if earnings or guidance falter in any quarter. Investors must weigh long-term promise against short-term risk. Palantir is proving itself as a real contender in AI-powered enterprise solutions. It has the momentum, the product-market fit, and the financial strength to keep growing. But the current price likely already reflects much of this optimism. While long-term investors should hold onto their positions, chasing the stock at these levels could prove risky. A better entry point may emerge after a pullback and valuation reset. PLTR currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Supply Lines is a daily newsletter that tracks global trade. Sign up here. Most Read from Bloomberg Next Stop: Rancho Cucamonga! Trump Said He Fired the National Portrait Gallery Director. She\u2019s Still There. Where Public Transit Systems Are Bouncing Back Around the World NYC Mayoral Candidates All Agree on Building More Housing. But Where? Senator Calls for Closing Troubled ICE Detention Facility in New Mexico Donald Trump brought many of the same grievances to his second trade war against China, but the economic battleground that\u2019s emerged since then is making it harder to avoid a rupture this time around. While tariffs kicked off the dispute, it\u2019s the new trade weapons being unsheathed by both sides that have come to define the latest standoff. And if the damage done so far is any indication, the scars will prove more enduring \u2014 no matter the outcome of trade talks in London that will continue into a second day on Tuesday. From higher education to jet engines, the scope of connections between the world\u2019s two biggest economies that they are weaponizing \u2014 or threatening to use as leverage in negotiations \u2014 is also much broader than last time. That could also make a deal more complex to navigate. \u201cThe US side has bundled together too many problems with the trade and economic agenda,\u201d said Sun Chenghao, a fellow at the Center for International Security and Strategy at Tsinghua University in Beijing. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that achieving a comprehensive package agreement through just one or two rounds of dialogue is realistic.\u201d Here are all the ways the US and China are trying to gain leverage: US Visas One tool the US has wielded this time is the threat of pulling the visas of the 270,000 Chinese students studying in the US. Late last month, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Chinese students\u2019 visas would be \u201caggressively\u201d revoked, including for people with connections to the Communist Party or studying in critical fields. Future applications from China and Hong Kong will also face heightened scrutiny, he said. Following the call with President Xi Jinping last week, Trump then said it would an \u201chonor\u201d to have Chinese students in the US, although it\u2019s far from clear what that will mean in practice. Jet Engines, Chip Design Software Before Trump returned to the Oval Office last January, the US had already imposed increasingly wide-ranging sanctions on various Chinese people and companies. It was also stepping up its bans on exports of both semiconductors and the tools to make them, including by pressuring allies such as Japan and the Netherlands to do the same. Building on those controls, the US Commerce Department rolled out a recent spate of measures targeting chip design software, jet engine parts, chemicals and nuclear materials, even as the details aren\u2019t all public. The department also stated that using a new chip made by Huawei anywhere in the world could violate US export controls, although it subsequently changed that language. The Trump administration expects that \u201cafter the handshake\u201d in London, \u201cany export controls from the US will be eased and the rare earths will be released in volume\u201d by China, Kevin Hassett, head of the White House\u2019s National Economic Council, told CNBC Monday. Hassett\u2019s comments from Washington were the clearest signal yet that the US is willing to offer such a concession, though he added that the US would stop short of including the most sophisticated chips made by Nvidia Corp. used to power artificial intelligence. Ethane The US administration is increasing barriers for exporters to sell the chemical ethane to China, in what looks to be an attempt to leverage a product where the US is as dominant as China is in rare earths. Thanks to the shale gas revolution, the US is the largest producer of ethane, which is used for making some plastics. China is its top customer, with US supply making up over 99% of the ethane it bought in the first four months of this year. It was so important that China quietly exempted ethane from the tariffs announced earlier this year. Even so, the Commerce Department has already indicated it plans to deny permission to export to at least one firm. That could make life harder for the vast constellation of plants along the eastern seaboard that Chinese firms built to take advantage of cheap US gas. Taiwan Arms Sales Another area where the US might put pressure on China is by stepping up sales of arms to Taiwan, which is claimed by Beijing. Underscoring the prominence of the issue is the specific mention of Taiwan in the call between Trump and Xi, according to the Chinese readout afterward. Two US officials familiar with the matter said they expect US approvals for arms sales to Taipei over the next four years to surpass those in Trump\u2019s first term, according to a Reuters report late last month. Those sales could further inflame tensions between the US and China. Trump\u2019s first term was marked by 22 military sales notifications for Taiwan valued at almost $19 billion, including backlogged cases and funding for maintenance of existing systems, according to a 2024 report from the Cato Institute, compared with about $8.7 billion during the Biden administration. Chinese Export Controls Beijing has learned from the effectiveness of US export controls, setting up its own system to limit and curb sales of \u201cdual-use goods\u201d that can have both civilian and military applications. That effort intensified this year, with Beijing ordering exporters to start applying for licenses to ship seven different rare earth elements and products made from them, including high performance permanent magnets that are essential for production of cars and tech products. Chinese state media this week denied that the new controls were an attempt to use China\u2019s dominance in the element\u2019s production as leverage against the US. But the measures were announced at the same time as a package of sanctions aimed at the US in response to tariffs. China is also using the same licensing regime for other key minerals such as gallium, germanium and antimony, widening that to others including bismuth, tungsten and some rare earths earlier this year. Some exports fell after licensing was required and eventually grew again but have not reached levels seen before they were added to the control list. After the call with Xi, Trump said he expected no problems with the supply of magnets. China does seem to be issuing licenses faster, although there is no indication that it will remove the requirement to get a license, meaning it could slow or stop issuing them again at any time. Jet Deliveries One new tool that Beijing used was to order a halt to deliveries of Boeing Co. jets, prompting at least one Chinese airliner to return a plane. While the ban was lifted later, with the company sending a 737 Max jet to China last week, the tensions have left the first major aircraft order from China since 2017 in limbo. Boeing had expected to deliver another 50 planes to China when the latest trade spat erupted in April, with Beijing countering Trump\u2019s new levies by hiking tariffs that priced the US-made jets out of the market for Chinese carriers. --With assistance from Colum Murphy.

        "content": "By Stephen Nellis SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -Nvidia (NVDA) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) said on Tuesday they are partnering with the Leibniz Supercomputing Centre to build a new supercomputer using Nvidia's next-generation chips. The Blue Lion supercomputer, as the project is called, will become available to scientists in early 2027, using Nvidia's \"Vera Rubin\" chips. The announcement, made at a supercomputing conference in Hamburg, Germany, follows Nvidia's announcement that the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab in the United States also plans to build a system using the chips next year. Separately, Nvidia also said that Jupiter, another supercomputer using its chips at German national research institute Forschungszentrum Julich, has officially become Europe's fastest system. The deals represent European institutions aiming to stay competitive against the U.S. in supercomputers used for scientific fields from biotechnology to climate research. Long before it became an artificial intelligence powerhouse, Nvidia set out to persuade scientists to use its chips to speed up complex computer problems, such as modeling climate change. Those problems required many precise calculations that could take months at a time. Nvidia is now working to persuade scientists to use artificial intelligence. Those AI systems can take the results of a few precise calculations and use them to make predictions that, while not as accurate as the fully calculated results, can still be useful while taking far less time. Nvidia on Tuesday unveiled what it calls its \"Climate in a Bottle\" AI model. In a press briefing, Dion Harris, head of data center product marketing at Nvidia, said scientists will be able to input a few initial conditions such as sea surface temperatures and generate a forecast for 10 to 30 years in the future and see what the weather may be like at any kilometer or so of the earth's surface. \"Researchers will use combined approach of classic physics and AI to resolve turbulent atmospheric flows,\" Harris said. \"This technique will allow them to analyze thousands and thousands more scenarios in greater detail than ever before.\" (Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by Lincoln Feast.)

        "content": "Semiconductors, or chips, each containing countless microscopic circuits, have been around for years as the building blocks that make advanced technology possible. Artificial intelligence (AI) hasn't necessarily brought anything new to the table in that regard. It'sartificial intelligence's staggering thirst for computing power, and thus, semiconductors, that has created perhaps the most significant investment opportunity the technology sector has seen since the early years of the internet. Ironically, two of the bestAI stocksare of companies that were already known to Wall Street. These two stocks have already turned $10,000 investments into millions over their lifetime, and could continue to thrive as AI chip demand continues to soar. Here is what you need to know. Image source: Getty Images. Most technology investors are familiar withNvidia's(NVDA-0.21%)immense success and gains, particularly since the emergence ofgenerative AIin late 2022 with the arrival of ChatGPT. The company's expertise in GPU chips, which excel at efficiently performing heavy computing workloads, helped Nvidia grab control of the market for data center chips used for training AI models. More than two years after the AI movement took off, Nvidia still dominates. Research estimates peg Nvidia's share of AI data center ships for generative AI models at a breathtaking 92%. Of course, the pressure is on Nvidia to hold its share, but it has succeeded thus far in doing so. The company's CUDA programming platform optimizes the performance of its AI GPU chips, which has been acompetitive moatthat other companies haven't breached. Nvidia succeeded its Hopper architecture with Blackwell, and future chips will continue to deliver more power while consuming less energy. Over time, Nvidia may need to develop new revenue streams beyond data centers. Nvidia will have opportunities as AI eventually extends outside centralized data centers to the edge, bringing computing power to localized AI uses, such as autonomous vehicles and robotics. For now, AI data center investments continue to roar. Analysts estimate Nvidia will grow revenue by nearly 54% to $199.7 billion this fiscal year, reaching $250.8 billion the following year. Meanwhile, Wall Street anticipates that Nvidia will grow its earnings by an average of almost 29% annually over the long term. While the stock'sforward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratioof 33 is higher than the broader market, it's a perfectly reasonable price for such a critical AI player with such excellent growth prospects. Broadcom(AVGO-0.07%)is quickly becoming a formidable force in the AI field. The company built its business on chips for networking and communications, and that's bearing fruit in the AI space. AI data centers utilize many thousands of chips that operate as clusters. For these clusters to function, all those chips must connect and work together, which requires special networking chips that Broadcom provides. AI networking chips accounted for approximately 40% of its AI revenue in Q2, representing a 70% year-over-year growth. Similar to Nvidia, Broadcom will likely sell more advanced chips over time that enable companies to build larger clusters of AI chips. Broadcom is diversified well beyond AI, so while the total business probably won't grow like Nvidia has, it's also not as dependent on AI, either. Broadcom's networking expertise is also unlocking additional AI opportunities. The company has established partnerships with several AI hyperscalers (the companies building all these data centers) on product roadmaps for custom AI chips for model training and inference. Inference chips, which enable models to operate effectively in real-world applications, will become increasingly important as AI continues to mature. Analysts are also optimistic about Broadcom's future, with expectations for revenue to grow by 21.7% to $62.7 billion this fiscal year, followed by $74.6 billion the following year. That top-line growth could translate to earnings growth averaging 23% annually over the long term. The stock is a bit more expensive, with a forward P/E ratio of 37, so investors who decide to invest may want to save some cash for when inevitable market volatility creates better buying opportunities.",

        "header": "Where Will CoreWeave Be in 1 Year?",
        "content": "CoreWeave(CRWV15.44%)zoomed from zero to hero on the stock market in just a couple of months. The company, which rents out access to the popularNvidiagraphics processing units (GPUs) needed to power generative-AI products, went public at the end of March in an initial public offering (IPO) that was widely regarded as a disappointment. The company had to lower its IPO price due to lack of demand, and sold fewer shares than it had intended. The debut priced at $40 and the stock closed below that mark as recently as April 22, but since surged due to positive updates from the company, as well as the overall market rebound made possible by cooling trade war tensions and generally solid economic data. At the time of this writing, CoreWeave is up 270% from its IPO price, and it could move even higher as the company is delivering phenomenal growth. In addition to improving sentiment, there were a number of news items that propelled CoreWeave shares higher. First, CoreWeave signed a $4 billion deal with OpenAI in May, showing continuing demand for CoreWeave's cloud-based platform. The deal signaled a diversification of its customer base away fromMicrosoft., which in 2024 accounted for 62% of CoreWeave's business. Additionally, Nvidia revealed that it owned $900 million of CoreWeave stock at the end of the first quarter. That stake is now worth roughly $3 billion. CoreWeave also posted strong first-quarter results with revenue up 420% to $981.6 million, though its generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) net loss expanded from $129.2 million to $314.6 million. CoreWeave's business model requires it to spend large sums up front on Nvidia chips, adding risk to the stock. The company's guidance called for revenue of $4.9 billion to $5.1 billion for the year, and capital expenditures of $20 billion to $23 billion. Image source: Getty Images. Predicting where any stock will be in a year is difficult, but CoreWeave faces additional uncertainty due to its short history as a publicly traded company, the inherent risk in its business model, the surge in its valuation, and the volatility in the broader market and in the AI sector. CoreWeave could easily top its revenue forecast for the year as its guidance, coming in its first report as a publicly traded company, is likely conservative. The forecast calls for roughly 160% in revenue growth. The company is also likely to see more big deals such as the one it just announced with OpenAI as it needs those to fuel its growth, and demand for AI computing power is still soaring. Investors appear willing to overlook CoreWeave's high debt burden in a rising interest rate environment, but the company would be rewarded if it refinanced its debt or lowered its risk in another way. A year from now, CoreWeave seems on track to have trailing revenue of around $6 billion, though its bottom-line results are much harder to predict, especially as a business that's profitable on an earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), but not on a GAAP basis. Ultimately, the company is beholden to broader demand for AI, though that seems to be safe for now. CoreWeave is a high-risk stock, but it looks well positioned to be a leader in AI cloud infrastructure as its growth rate reflects soaring demand for its services. The company is burning cash and pays a high interest on its debt, adding to the risk. However, considering the blowout growth rate and its leading position in AI cloud infrastructure, the upside potential the stock offers after its post-IPO rally is substantial. Following that logic, opening a small position wouldn't be a bad idea for risk-tolerant investors.",

        "content": "TheS&P 500climbed back out of its year-to-date declines and is finally showing gains, up 2% so far this year. The future is uncertain, especially concerning tariffs, and investors are wary. But that doesn't mean investors are taking a break. Stocks continue to go up and down, with plenty of market beaters and plenty of market laggards; the S&P 500 is an average, after all, and some investors have pretty heated, and often opposing, views on different stocks. Image source: Getty Images. TakeTesla(TSLA1.69%), for example. The Elon Musk-ledelectric vehicle (EV) powerhousehas certainly minted some millionaires, but it's facing increasing competition, among other issues, and it's down 27% this year -- including a double-digit loss on Thursday after CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump publicly sparred over social media.Nvidia(NVDA-0.21%)is also a polarizing stock, with the bulls and the bears split on just how big the company's future opportunity really is. At least one billionaire investor has made his current opinion clear.Hedge fundThird Point, run by billionaire Dan Loeb, has about 45 equity positions. In the first quarter, Third Point sold all of its Tesla andMeta Platforms(META0.83%)stock, and it bought 1.45 million shares of Nvidia stock, worth $157 million, in addition to some other trades. Let's see what investors are thinking about these stocks today. The Third Point hedge fund is described as an \"opportunistic, event-driven approach to finding investments.\" While its portfolio typically only has around 45 stocks, they change frequently. That strategy will influence how it invests, and as with hedge funds in general, it has different goals than the average individual investor who isn't investing billions of dollars. The fund first bought Tesla stock in the 2024 third quarter and increased its stake in the fourth quarter, finally dumping it all in the 2025 first quarter. It's not hard to see why investors are worried about Tesla stock right now. The U.S. EV company has tons of new competition, and automotive revenue sank 20% from last year in the first quarter, triggering a 9% decrease in total revenue. Its new robotaxi initiative, which investors are counting on to breathe new life back into the company, may not be the savior the company needs to rebound. There are already other self-driving cars on the road or in the works, and it may take time until the technology is robust enough to be a real revenue booster. In addition, Tesla took a black eye when Musk was working as a special temporary federal employee and became one of Trump's closest and most controversial advisors. Musk has left the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to return his focus on his businesses as Tesla saw deliveries and profits slump in the first quarter. But now that Musk is publicly sparring with Trump -- and the president is threatening to pull federal contracts from Musk's busineses -- Tesla stock is slumping yet again. Tesla stock is far from cheap, trading at 164 timestrailing-12-month earnings. Tesla stock is up around 68% from the time Third Point bough it, and given its strategy, it looks like it could be a good time to pocket its winnings. Meta is the leader in social media and digital advertising, two growing industries. Digital advertising continues to replace print ads, and as a low-cost business, Meta is leveraging its unparalleled platforms to generate high profits. Revenue increased 16% year over year in the first quarter, and net income increased 35%.  It has a superlativeoperating marginthat was 41% in the first quarter. Meta stock isn't quite as polarizing as Tesla or Nvidia, with investors (fairly) uniformly seeing it as a good long-term play. It's up 18% in 2025, beating out the rest of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. Third Point bought Meta stock in the 2023 third quarter, and it's up 132% since then. Although Meta is beating the market this year and still has massive opportunities, Loeb and his team might see this as a good time to take their earnings, especially if they were looking for capital to invest in other stocks being driven by current events, like Nvidia. While Third Point made solid money from its investments in Meta and Tesla, it missed out on the massive gains in Nvidia stock, which is up 1,500% over the past five years. Clearly, Loeb thinks that's far from over, and with Nvidia stock down earlier this year and trading at a bargain price, it looked ripe for the picking. Nvidia stock plummeted in February when news came out about China's cheap DeepSeek artificial intelligence (AI) platform, but Nvidia maintained that it was good news for the entire AI industry, and that its best-in-class chips were only going to be in even greater demand. With two excellent earnings reports since then behind it, the market is reembracing the AI powerhouse. Revenue increased 69% year over year in the 2026 fiscal first quarter (ended April 27), and demand is strong for its newest Blackwell AI technology. It's a real feat to keep reporting such high growth when it already has $148 billion in trailing-12-month revenue, and it's also incredibly profitable, with $78 billion in trailing-12-month income and a 52%profit margin. As the unmatched leader in the industry, with constant innovation, Nvidia has massive opportunities up ahead as generative AI becomes a part of daily life and companies need its chips to deliver. As the cherry on top, Nvidia stock trades at only 25times forward, one-year earnings. It's easy to see why Loeb thinks it's a good time to buy Nvidia today, and he grabbed it on a dip. Investors can still find value in buying Nvidia stock at the current price.",

        "content": "The stock's strong performance following a \"fundamentally poor quarter\" has been partly due to anticipation for the June launch of both a more affordable vehicle and robotaxi service, the analyst told investors.  Baird on Monday downgraded Tesla Inc. (TSLA) shares to \u2018Neutral\u2019 from \u2018Outperform\u2019 with an unchanged price target of $320. The EV-maker\u2019s stock traded 2% lower in Monday\u2019s pre-market session.  The stock's strong performance following a \"fundamentally poor quarter\" has been partly due to anticipation for the June launch of both a more affordable vehicle and robotaxi service, the analyst told investors in a note, as per TheFly.  However, Baird believes Tesla CEO Elon Musk's comments regarding the robotaxi ramp rate \"are a bit too optimistic,\" and that this excitement has been priced into shares. The firm also noted that Musk's ties to President Trump, which soured last week following a war of words, \"have added considerable uncertainty.\"  However, Baird sees Tesla as a core holding in the long term. The $320 price target also implies an 8% upside to the company\u2019s closing price on Friday.  Musk has been looking to shift Tesla\u2019s image from an automaker to an artificial intelligence and robotics company with self-driving robotaxis and humanoid robots called Optimus.  While the pilot launch of robotaxis is expected this week in Austin, Texas, the company is looking to build Optimus on its pilot production line at the Fremont factory this year.  As interest in robotics and AI-integrated mobility accelerates, stocks like $GM, $F, $NVDA, $BGM, and $QCOM could benefit from broader adoption trends, particularly around autonomous systems and next-gen automation platforms.  However, Tesla\u2019s lead executive for its Optimus humanoid robot program, Milan Kovac, left the company on personal grounds last week.  Kovac, who joined Tesla in 2016, said in an X post on Friday that he will be moving out of his position as a vice president of engineering.  \u201cI\u2019ve been far away from home for too long, and will need to spend more time with family abroad,\u201d he wrote while also terming it \u201cthe most difficult decision\u201d of his life.  Kovac also clarified that the decision has nothing to do with anything else.  \u201cMy support for Elon Musk and the team is ironclad - Tesla team forever,\u201d he said. \u201cElon, you\u2019ve taught me to discern signal from noise, hardcore resilience, and many fundamental principles of engineering. I am forever grateful. Tesla will win, I guarantee you that.\u201d  Kovac also opined that his exit will not delay the Optimus project, which he took over in 2022.  In April, Musk said that Tesla will initially deploy a small fleet of its Model Y vehicles in June as part of the robotaxi pilot launch in Austin. The CEO also stated that he sees Tesla operating robotaxis in many other U.S. cities by the end of the year.  Musk also stated that the company anticipates having thousands of Optimus robots operating at its factories by year-end.",

        "content": "Struggling to save money and manage your finances? If the answer is yes, TikToker Seema Sheth\u2019s \u201c30-day financial cleanse\u201d may help you. In 2023, the vlogger and Federal Reserve Bank employee introduced 30 daily video clips lasting no more than a few minutes each via her TikTok channel@bobeema. The objective was to offer easy-to-understand, engaging advice on how to\u201clive in harmony with your money.\u201d Keen to learn more?Here are the main tips she provided. To maximize your finances, you first need to identify all your income and expenses. Sheth recommends breaking expenses into three categories (fixed, variable, and discretionary), writing them down, and comparing them to your income. The target, she says, is to spend 50% of earnings on fixed, non-negotiable expenses, 30% on wants, and save the remaining 20%. Saving 20%, which includes contributions to a 401(k) or other retirement account, may require serious spending cuts.\u00a0Tips to cut non-essential expenses include assessing each one and asking yourself if you can livereallywithout it; expressing its cost as a percentage of your monthly spending allowance, which helps demonstrate how much it eats into your finances; and shopping for better deals. Sheth sayshousing costs should not exceed 30%of your income. Sheth recommendstaking on as little debt as possibleand not taking for granted you will have more money in the future. In terms of current debt, she urges people to prioritize paying back the more expensive ones first. She\u2019s also a fan of automating repayments, as well as keeping bills in a folder and choosing a day each month to address them. Sheth says you should automatically put asidethree to six months\u2019 worth of living costsjust in case things go sideways.\u00a0The exact amount you choose depends on personal circumstances, such as whether you have dependents and other incomes in the household. Once you\u2019ve paid off debt, minimized expenses, and filled your emergency fund, it\u2019s time to pursue that20% savings target. Sheth recommends writing down your goals, such as a down payment for a home or vacation, separating them into four separate timeframes (one to two years, within the next five years, in 10 years, and 20 years plus) and then dividing each of their estimated costs by the number of months the goal needs to be achieved by. This makes it possible to identify how much you need to allocate to each saving objective each month and whether to put the money in an easy-access savings account or invest it in stocks. Other tips offered by Sheth: TikTok is full of tips from so-called experts about how to become wealthier and live a better life. Not all of them are useful or even practical. But Seema Sheth\u2019s \u201c30-day financial cleanse\u201d is an exception. In a series of short and easy-to-understand videos, Sheth explains simple strategies to reduce unnecessary spending and make important financial goals achievable. Most of what she says isn\u2019t groundbreaking. However, it\u2019s well-presented and engaging, which are characteristics financial education often lacks.",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The surging shares of CoreWeave Inc. and Palantir Technologies Inc. are drawing comparisons to meme stocks \u2014 whose rapid gains are fueled by retail trader fervor more than financial performance. Most Read from Bloomberg Trump\u2019s Military Parade Has Washington Bracing for Tanks and Weaponry Trump Said He Fired the National Portrait Gallery Director. She\u2019s Still There. NYC Mayoral Candidates All Agree on Building More Housing. But Where? Senator Calls for Closing Troubled ICE Detention Facility in New Mexico California Pitches Emergency Loans for LA, Local Transit Systems CoreWeave has nearly quadrupled since its heavily downsized initial public offering in March. Palantir is up more than 460% over the past year. Investors may hope that the shares will perform like Nvidia Corp., whose stock soared at the start of the artificial intelligence era. The risk is that they act more like retailer GameStop Corp. \u2014 now 66% below a 2021 peak. \u201cInvestors are ignoring fundamentals just to jump on the trend, and if you stretch a rubber band, the snapback can be substantial,\u201d said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers Group. \u201cYou need fresh money to reinforce the trend, otherwise the moves aren\u2019t sustainable.\u201d Shares of CoreWeave fell 5.8% on Tuesday while Palantir slipped 0.4%. Hints of such risks came last week, when cloud-computing provider CoreWeave tumbled 17% out of the blue, its biggest one-day drop on record. The shares since recovered and neared a fresh high on Monday. CoreWeave and Palantir are among this year\u2019s best-performing stocks amid a resurgence of the AI trade as tech giants continue to spend heavily on computing infrastructure. CoreWeave rents cloud-computing capacity and counts Microsoft Corp. as one of its biggest customers. Palantir makes data analysis software used by governments and commercial customers. Representatives for CoreWeave and Palantir did not immediately respond to Bloomberg News requests for comment. In contrast to GameStop, a video-game retailer that faced real challenges during the pandemic, both are clearly benefiting from strong demand for their services. CoreWeave\u2019s revenue is expected to more than double this year, according to the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Palantir\u2019s is projected to increase by 36%, aided by brisk sales of its AI offerings. The problem is whether investors are over-paying for that growth. Palantir trades at 71 times estimated sales, making it by far the most expensive stock in the S&P 500. CoreWeave, which had a net loss of $315 million in the first quarter, is priced at 10 times projected sales. The average in the S&P 500 is around 3 times. However, those high-flying valuations have been little deterrence for retail investors, who are piling into the names. Data from Interactive Brokers show Palantir and CoreWeave are among the most active stocks by client orders, a sign of heavy retail interest. While that list leads with more familiar favorites like Nvidia and Tesla Inc., it is also heavy with riskier plays like leveraged exchange-traded funds and the quantum computing company D-Wave Quantum Inc., which has jumped 161% from a May low. Vanda Research, which analyzes trends in both retail trading and sentiment, has also observed rising activity from the retail crowd, especially in more speculative stocks. \u201cMom-and-pop traders appear increasingly comfortable venturing into higher-beta plays, from small caps to second-derivative AI themes,\u201d wrote Marco Iachini, senior vice president of research, in a note published last week. \u201cSentiment appears overwhelmingly positive for those with strong recent momentum or AI exposure.\u201d Of course, bulls have plenty they can point to for the rallies. Nvidia, one of the world\u2019s most influential companies, revealed it had a bigger-than-expected stake in CoreWeave last month. CoreWeave also expanded a deal with OpenAI and entered into two lease agreements with Applied Digital Corp. Palantir has delivered strong revenue forecasts in recent quarters and is reportedly winning more US government contracts from the Trump administration. Still, investors have been burned by these kinds of AI trades before. Super Micro Computer Inc. more than quadrupled last year before a selloff that erased more than 80% of its value amid accounting problems. BigBear.ai Holdings Inc. and SoundHound AI Inc. also experienced sharp rallies in recent months on heavy volume that were followed by reversals. \u201cClearly meme investing is back, but you\u2019re playing with fire if you try to trade stocks like these,\u201d said Gene Munster, co-founder and managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management. \u201cThat\u2019s why we won\u2019t own something like CoreWeave. It is so way, way overvalued that there\u2019s no way we could be comfortable in it.\u201d Top Tech Stories Mark Zuckerberg, frustrated with Meta Platforms Inc.\u2019s shortfalls in AI, is assembling a team of experts to achieve artificial general intelligence, recruiting from a brain trust of AI researchers and engineers who\u2019ve met with him in recent weeks at his homes in Lake Tahoe and Palo Alto. Apple Inc. unveiled the most sweeping software redesign in its history, aiming to make the company\u2019s device lineup more cohesive and useful, even while doing little to upgrade its struggling artificial intelligence platform. Huawei Technologies Co. founder Ren Zhengfei dismissed the impact of US export restrictions on China in a front-page People\u2019s Daily article, wading into one of the key topics dogging Washington-Beijing trade negotiations. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the main chipmaker for Nvidia Corp. and Apple Inc., reported a 40% jump in May revenue after companies stockpiled chips in response to mounting trade uncertainty.

        "content": "June 10- Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) will build a new supercomputer for Germany's Leibniz Supercomputing Centre. The system, namedBlue Lion, will use Nvidia's upcoming \"Vera Rubin\" chips. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. Scientists expect to gain access to Blue Lion in early 2027. The companies revealed the project at a supercomputing conference in Hamburg. This follows Nvidia's earlier news that the U.S. Lawrence Berkeley National Lab also plans a Vera Rubin-based system for next year. Separately, Nvidia noted the \"Jupiter\" supercomputer, powered by its technology at Germany's Forschungszentrum Julich, is now ranked as Europe's fastest system. The projects highlight European efforts to remain competitive with the U.S. in supercomputing. These powerful machines are vital tools for research in areas like biotechnology and climate science. Based on the one year price targets offered by 52 analysts, the average target price for NVIDIA Corp is $174.71 with a high estimate of $372.87 and a low estimate of $100.00. The average target implies a upside of +22.49% from the current price of $142.63. Based on GuruFocus estimates, the estimated GF Value for NVIDIA Corp in one year is $273.40, suggesting a upside of +91.68% from the current price of $142.63.

        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)is building a new supercomputerin Germany with Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) and the Leibniz Supercomputing Centre. The system, called Blue Lion, will be built using HPE's next-generation Cray technology and Nvidia's powerful GPUs. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. What's under the hood? Blue Lion will run on Nvidia's Vera Rubin architecture a combo of its new Rubin GPU and its first-ever custom CPU, called Vera. According to Nvidia, the system will be roughly 30 times more powerful than Germany's current flagship machine, SuperMUC-NG. The supercomputer is set to go live for researchers across Europe in early 2027, as first reported by Reuters. Meanwhile, Nvidia has also rolled out an AI foundation model built to simulate Earth's climate at kilometer-level precision. Named Climate in a Bottle or cBottle, the tool is part of Nvidia's Earth-2 platform, which blends AI, GPU acceleration, and physics-based modeling. The idea is to generate highly detailed atmospheric data faster and more energy-efficiently than traditional simulation methods and without giving up on accuracy. cBottle can take into account time of day, season, and sea surface temperatures to create realistic atmospheric models. Institutions like the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology and the Allen Institute for AI are already testing how cBottle can help compress climate data and make Earth's complex systems easier to explore. The launch reflects Nvidia's broader push into science-focused applications for AI and high-performance computing, beyond the data center and enterprise cloud.

        "content": "Micron Technology\u2019s MU high bandwidth memory (HBM) chips are experiencing robust traction due to their growing use in high-performance computing, hyperscalers and artificial intelligence data centers. The high demand for these chips has led to Micron\u2019s HBM revenues crossing $1 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, marking a major milestone. Since Micron\u2019s HBM3E and HBM3E-12H variants offer significant power reduction in comparison to its competitors while also delivering higher memory capacity, customers have already placed a large demand for these products, resulting in Micron being fully sold out of its HBM supply for calendar 2025. The HBMs developed by Micron have a total addressable market estimate of more than $35 billion for the calendar year 2025. Now the company is focusing on HBM delivery agreements for 2026. It is worth noting that the largest AI-chip manufacturer,NVIDIANVDA, announced in January 2025 that Micron is a key supplier for its GeForce RTX 50 Blackwell GPUs, solidifying Micron\u2019s positioning in the HBM market. NVIDIA has installed Micron\u2019s HBM3E 8H chips inside the NVIDIA GB200 system and HBM3E 12H chips in NVIDIA GB300. To top it all off, Micron is developing the next generation of high bandwidth memory, HBM4, which will increase the bandwidth by more than 60% compared to HBM3E. The company will ramp the production volume of HBM4 in 2026. With Micron experiencing a sequential surge of 50% in HBM revenues in the second quarter of fiscal 2025, and considering its future plans, it is quite evident that momentum in HBMs will persist. Micron anticipates third-quarter fiscal 2025 revenues of $8.80 billion (+/-$200 million). The Zacks Consensus Estimates for third-quarter fiscal 2025 is pegged at $8.81 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 29.33%. The global HBM market is highly consolidated, with a handful of players in this space. Companies, including SK hynix,TSMCTSM and Samsung, exist in this space. However, not all of them compete directly against Micron. While SK Hynix and Samsung develop their own HBM2E, HBM3, and HBM3E, TSMC develops HBM packages based on SK Hynix\u2019s HBMs. In 2024, SK hynix and TSMC collaborated to collectively develop HBM4 and next-generation packaging technology. This collaboration has led SK hynix to adopt TSMC\u2019s foundry process to develop its HBM4, showcased for the first time in April 2025. Since the HBM space has a few capable players and huge growth opportunities, this provides a strong growth opportunity for Micron. Shares of MU have gained 31.8% year to date compared with the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry\u2019s growth of 15.1%. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research From a valuation standpoint, MU trades at a forward price-to-sales ratio of 2.84X, lower than the industry\u2019s average of 3.53X. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research The Zacks Consensus Estimate for MU\u2019s fiscal 2025 earnings implies year-over-year growth of 433%, while the 2026 earnings estimate implies growth of 55.87%.

Net sales increased 7.5% year-over-year to $8.06 billion, also ahead of estimates. The company reported the sales jump was \"primarily driven by a 4% increase in wholesale unit volumes, including the benefit of new business with existing and new customers, as well as inflation,\" adding the performance \"was led by natural product growth.\" In response to the online attack, CEO Sandy Douglas explained the company was \"focused on diligently managing through the cyber incident we announced yesterday to rapidly and safely restore our capabilities, while helping our customers with short-term solutions wherever possible.\" United Natural Foods is a major supplier of Amazon's (AMZN) Whole Foods Markets.

Citing sources familiar with the matter, theFinancial Timesreported on Monday that Parvus Asset Management has bought up shares in Novo Nordisk, and is looking to influence the hiring of the drugmaker's next CEO. The fund has not disclosed the size of its stake because it is still under 5% of Novo Nordisk's total shares, the legal threshold requiring disclosure under Danish law, theFinancial Timesreported. The Novo Nordisk Foundation nonprofit owns the majority of voting rights in the weight loss giant, which theFTreported could make any activist pressure campaign difficult. Novo Nordisk's U.S.-listed shares have lost nearly half their value in the last 12 months as sales growth for its landmark weight loss drugs Ozempic and Wegovy have started to slow.

        "content": "The AI trade has jumped back into favor over recent weeks following some strong quarterly releases, with AI favorites such as NVIDIA NVDA, Innodata INOD, and Broadcom AVGO all seeing big gains. Below is a chart illustrating the performance of each over the last month, with the S&P 500 blended in as a benchmark. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research For those interested in momentum, let\u2019s take a closer look at each. We\u2019ve all been accustomed to NVIDIA\u2019s recent story, with its historical growth fueled by unrelenting demand for its Data Center products. The tech titan continued to fire on all cylinders throughout its latest release concerning its Data Center, with sales of $39.1 billion up 73% from the $22.5 billion print in the same period last year. As shown below, NVDA\u2019s Data Center results have regularly blown away our consensus Data Center expectations over recent periods. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research CEO Jensen Huang again provided a bullish statement in the latest release, stating \u2013 \u201cGlobal demand for NVIDIA\u2019s AI infrastructure is incredibly strong. AI inference token generation has surged tenfold in just one year, and as AI agents become mainstream, the demand for AI computing will accelerate. Countries around the world are recognizing AI as essential infrastructure \u2014 just like electricity and the internet \u2014 and NVIDIA stands at the center of this profound transformation.\u201d The stock overall still reflects one of the strongest AI plays out there, with shares also not overly expensive. Shares currently trade at a 30.1X forward 12-month earnings multiple, a fraction of the 106.3X five-year highs and well beneath the 50.0X five-year median. The current PEG ratio works out to a fair 1.1X, again well beneath five-year highs and the five-year median. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Innodata is a global data engineering company that provides a range of transferable solutions, platforms, and services for Generative AI / AI builders and adopters. Like those above, Innodata has been enjoying supercharged growth, with sales of $58.3 million throughout its latest period climbing 120% year-over-year. Below is a chart illustrating the company\u2019s sales on a quarterly basis. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Importantly, the company reiterated its FY25 revenue growth guidance of 40% or more, a critical announcement given the all-around uncertainty lingering stemming from tariffs. Many companies were unable to provide or reaffirm guidance outlooks throughout the Q1 cycle, but Innodata cleared the crucial hurdle. Analysts have maintained their bullish sales outlooks following the release, with the $242 million in sales expected for its FY25 up more than 50% over the last year. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Broadcom is evolving a broad portfolio of technologies to extend its leadership in enabling next-generation AI infrastructure. This includes foundational technologies and advanced packaging capabilities aimed at building the highest performance, lowest power custom AI accelerators. The stock currently sports a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), with its earnings outlook inching higher across several timeframes over recent months thanks to strong quarterly results. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Concerning its latest quarterly release just last week, AI revenue of $4.4 billion moved 46% higher year-over-year. The quarter\u2019s results were driven by robust demand for its AI solutions, with the company forecasting AI semiconductor revenue of $5.1 billion for its Q3. Notably, AVGO posted a record $15.0 billion in sales, which grew a strong 20% year-over-year. Its cash-generating abilities also saw a nice boost, with free cash flow of $6.4 billion also reflecting a record and climbing 44% year-over-year. Below is a chart illustrating the company\u2019s sales on a quarterly basis. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Bottom Line The AI trade has jumped back into favor recently, with all three companies above \u2013 Broadcom AVGO, NVIDIA NVDA, and Innodata INOD \u2013 seeing big gains over the past month. All three companies posted strong results in their latest quarterly releases, with the positivity driven by red-hot demand stemming from the AI frenzy.

        "content": "NVIDIAhas made significant strides with the launch of the JUPITER supercomputer and its innovative collaboration with IonQ. These advancements demonstrate NVIDIA's ongoing leadership in supercomputing and quantum computing, respectively, contributing positively to the company's positioning. Additionally, despite broader market fluctuations and uncertainties related to geopolitical trade talks, NVIDIA\u2019s recent earnings report showing strong sales and net income bolstered investor confidence. During the last quarter, NVIDIA experienced a 31% price increase, reflecting the combination of these developments and aligning with general optimism in the tech sector, as indicated by the rise in key indexes like the Nasdaq Composite. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 1 risk for NVIDIA you should know about. These 18 companies survived and thrived after COVID and have the right ingredients to survive Trump's tariffs. Discover why before your portfolio feels the trade war pinch. The recent advances in NVIDIA's supercomputing and quantum computing sectors, including the launch of the JUPITER supercomputer and collaboration with IonQ, are expected to bolster NVIDIA's position in these high-growth areas. This news complements the company's strategic pivot toward AI model scaling and portends potential revenue enhancements from increased AI workload demands. However, regulatory challenges and export controls could pose risks, particularly in maintaining diversified revenue streams across key markets like China. Over the past five years, NVIDIA's total shareholder returns, including share price and dividends, have risen by a very large percentage, reflecting investor enthusiasm for its innovations and growth prospects. This compares favorably to the broader market benchmarks over the past year, where NVIDIA's share price outpaced the US Semiconductor industry growth rate. NVIDIA's strategic collaborations with Toyota and Uber could positively impact future revenue and earnings forecasts, particularly in the automotive sector. Analysts anticipate NVIDIA's revenue to grow annually by 30.3% over the next three years, with some potential margin contraction. With the share price currently at US$113.54, there is a 20.6% discount to the consensus price target of US$163.12, suggesting room for appreciation if NVIDIA meets or exceeds these expectations.

As Washington and Beijing enter another tense round of negotiations over technology and rare earths, Ren made it clear that Huawei isn't standing still. While he admitted the company is still behind the U.S. in single-chip output, Ren pointed to packaging, stacking, and cluster-based computing as viable ways to get comparable AI performance. Huawei is not that good yet, he said, but he's betting that an open-source future and hardware workarounds could keep China in the AI racedespite ongoing U.S. pressure. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. That pressure may not be holding as firmly as hoped. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang recently acknowledged that Chinese AI firms are becoming formidable and filling the void left by U.S. tech exits. Huawei, once sidelined by U.S. sanctions, is now making powerful AI chips at SMIC using advanced packaging methodsbundling chips to act like a single, high-performance unit. This isn't just theoretical. Huawei's making real gains in AI and EV software, and its comeback in smartphones has already rattled expectations. Huang's warning suggests that U.S. firms could be watching their lead erode faster than anticipated. Huawei's story isn't just about bouncing backit's about adapting fast under pressure. Since landing on the Entity List, the company has retooled its strategy, leaning on engineering innovation to replace what it lost in supply chains.

        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA,Financials)shares have rallied nearly 50%since an early spring decline, driven by robust artificial intelligence demand and easing trade tensions, but at least one investor is urging caution. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. The company posted record Q1 Fiscal 2026 revenue of $44 billion, up 69% year over year, with its data center segment expanding 73%. That momentum helped boost sentiment even after a prior quarter was dented by a $4.5 billion revenue loss tied to U.S. export restrictions on its H20 GPUs. Investor Johnny Zhang said the rebound may be premature given ongoing geopolitical risks and uncertainty surrounding future AI investment. Zhang cited Nvidia's expected $8 billion inventory write-down as a direct result of lingering export issues. The company could also lose access to a $50 billion total addressable market in China if restrictions remain in place, he added. Zhang said tariffs imposed under the Trump administration may deliver more impact in the second half of 2025. While Nvidia's fundamentals remain strong, he said the recent rally may not be sustainable without clearer visibility. Chasing the stock's rally from here seems less compelling to me, Zhang said, maintaining a Hold rating. Wall Street remains more bullish, with 35 Buy, 4 Hold, and 1 Sell rating.

        "header": "There Are Lots of Ways To Invest In Tech. What's the Best Option for You?",
        "content": "Technology affects nearly every part of our everyday lives, from how we live, work, and even invest. Innovations from the tech sector continue to drive economic growth, making tech investing a popular choice for investors. Investors looking for long-term growth or to diversify their retirement portfolios may want to consider howtech investing can helpthem reach their goals. Tech investing is riskier than many other investments, but there are lots of ways to invest in tech for investors of all risk tolerances and investing experience levels. In this article, you can learn about different ways to invest in tech and how to decide which option is right for you. The technology sector has become a giant in the global markets. While it's easy to see the innovations in phones, artificial intelligence (AI), automation, and, recently, even quantum computing, there is not a market sector that technology has not touched. TheMagnificent Seven stocks, or the top-performing tech stocks, are major US economy and stock market drivers. These companies include Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Nvidia, and Broadcom. Like the little engine that could, these tech stocks have seemingly chugged through market ups and downs to remain on top. Their consistent performance and influence are getting investors' attention. Tech investing is a fantastic diversifier across industries and risk factors, with a strong history of long-term growth. Tech assets can also help balance out more conservative investments to help keep portfolios allocated correctly for an investor's risk tolerance, timeline, and goals. We live in a digital world where technological advancements happen every day, while we are doom-scrolling or micro learning on our phones that continue to get smaller and more powerful. Technology is here to stay, and tech companies are at the center of economic trends, especially as innovations can cause valuations to skyrocket. That\u2019s a rocket a lot of investors want to ride. When adding tech to your portfolio, you've got plenty of options. You can invest directly in blue-chip giants, take a chance on startups through crowdfunding, get in on the crypto craze, or choose a more diversified route with ETFs or mutual funds. Each approach has advantages, trade-offs, and potential roles in an investment strategy. You can invest directly in tech companies by buying shares oftech companies in the stock market. These companies range from tech giants like Apple, Nvidia, and Microsoft to newer market stocks like Arm Holdings.Whichever company you choose, buying individual stocks represents partial ownership in the company. You're buying their potential, but it's important to remember that while a rising tide raises all ships, when the tide goes out, even yachts hit the mud. Role in retirement portfolio:Shares of well-established tech companies can deliverlong-term capital appreciationfor investors with enough of a runway to retirement to weather the ups and downs of the more volatile tech stocks. Some tech giants like Microsoft have over a 20-year history of paying dividends.Dividends reinvested help you collect more shares over time and incrementally, but powerfully, accelerate portfolio growth. How to start:If you want to invest in stocks as part of your retirement portfolio, you must open atraditionalorRothindividual retirement account (IRA). Most employer-sponsored accounts like 401(k)s do not allow investors to choose individual stocks. To open a traditional or Roth IRA, you can go through a brokerage firm or financial advisor\u2014or take a self-directed approach with an online broker like Fidelity or Schwab. Techexchange-traded funds(ETFs) offer exposure to many tech stocks in one neat little package. ETFs are, by design, more diversified than buying a single stock. Even ETFs like the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK), which cover 72 top-performing tech stocks, are subject to concentration risk. Role in retirement portfolio:Don't put all your eggs or money into one basket, but putting some of your money into a basket of tech stocks, with an ETF, is an excellent option for investing in tech. ETFs reduce risk because they're diversified across many firms and trade like stocks on the exchanges. Most retirement accounts allow investors to invest in ETFs, and they often have much lower fees than mutual funds, meaning more of your money goes to growing your nest egg and not managers. How to start:If you already have a 401(k), check with your plan administrator to see if you can choose a tech ETF for a portion of your portfolio. If you're starting retirement savings, a brokerage firm with a Traditional or Roth IRA should allow you to select a tech ETF. Look forpassively managed fundswith low-expense ratios and a strong performance history. Tech mutual funds are often actively managed baskets of tech-related assets.Mutual fundspool money from investors and select assets that align with the mutual fund's stated objective. Portfolio managers rebalance and reallocate as necessary to maintain the optimal mix for the goals of the mutual fund. Role in retirement portfolio:Actively managed funds can outperform benchmarks, especially in complex and volatile sectors like tech. Tech mutual funds might work in your portfolio if you want exposure to tech and a professional looking out for your best interest, and keeping your exposure inside the parameters established by the mutual fund. How to start:Like tech ETFs, you can purchase tech mutual funds in most retirement accounts directly or through fund families like Fidelity or Vanguard. The active management aspect of tech mutual funds makes them more expensive than other assets. Check the expense ratios of mutual funds before investing because high expense ratios can eat into returns. Crowdfundingis one way up-and-coming tech companies raise capital by getting small investments from many people in exchange for equity, revenue-sharing, and even perks (like early access to a new product). When crowdfunding works, it can work BIG. When crowdfunding doesn't work, you lose your investment with no recourse. Role in retirement portfolio:Crowdfunding can strike like a match, be a slow burn, or fizzle altogether. Crowdfunding generally doesn't have a place in retirement portfolios because it's highly illiquid, speculative, and risky. However, for the right investor with a rock-solid investment strategy and iron investing will,equity crowdfunding, in particular, can work in a retirement portfolio because the upside is significant if the company succeeds. How to start:Platforms like StartEngine, Republic, and Kickstarter allow investors to get in on the ground level of a company's elevator to success. Investing directly in a retirement account is trickier. Onlyself-directed IRAsand 401(k)s allow you the flexibility to choose your investments, like crowdfunding. Cryptocurrencyis a digital asset that uses blockchain technology to facilitate decentralized transactions without intermediaries like banks. Cryptocurrency has gained mainstream momentum in the last few years as more and more investors see crypto as a market disruptor. Role in retirement portfolio:Cryptocurrency is a speculative investment, but some investors may value it for diversification or growth potential. By traditional investment standards, some cryptocurrencies, likeBitcoin, have shown tremendous growth even when faced with extreme volatility, regulation crackdowns, and skeptics. How to start:You can incorporate crypto into your retirement investment strategies in a few ways. You can open acrypto IRAand directly invest in crypto assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum. You may use a self-directed IRA or 401(k) or choose ETFs that track crypto in most retirement accounts. With so many choices for investing in tech, it's hard to know the best option. Suitable tech investments depend on your financial goals, experience level, risk tolerance, and timeline. It's also important to consider liquidity and diversification when deciding where tech fits in your portfolio. If you prefer stability or are newer to investing, tech-focused ETFs or mutual funds can be a solid starting point. These assets offer instant diversification and professional management, helping to reduce some of the risks of tech investing. While they may not grow as quickly as individual stocks, they usually have steadier returns and lower volatility. If you have a higher risk tolerance or more experience with investing, you may feel comfortable picking individual tech stocks or emerging tech options like cryptocurrency or crowdfunding. All of these options offer high growth potential but also higher risk. Crowdfunding, particularly, has liquidity risk because there is no secondary market. Even if your risk tolerance is sky-high, keeping tech exposure as only a portion of your retirement savings portfolio to balance it with more stable assets is smart. Tech ETFs or mutual funds are a good starting point for investors with no experience. These assets have built-in diversification and professional management.\u00a0 To start here, look closely at performance history and expense ratios to ensure you get the most bang for your buck. Companies like Apple, Alphabet, and Microsoft have the data to support their reliable long-term growth. Tech companies like Microsoft also have a history of paying dividends, which can also increase growth over time. Crowdfunding and cryptocurrency are the two riskiest tech investments. They're both very speculative and lack any central regulation. Crowdfunding also has extremely limited liquidity, so once you've committed, you're all in for better or worse. The best tech stocks to own depends on your goals, timeline, and risk tolerance, but some indicators can help you decide. Look for industry leaders with a competitive edge, strong balance sheets, consistent growth, and appropriate valuation. Tech investing offers investors an opportunity to benefit from dynamic growth. However, this sector is risky and requires investors to pay special attention to their risk tolerance, timeline, goals, and investing experience level. High-growth opportunities like stocks, cryptocurrency, and crowdsourcing may seem appealing, but their volatility and lack of diversification mean they're not right for everyone. Still, there are plenty of options for investors who value more stable assets, like tech-focused ETFs and mutual funds. As technology continues to evolve, there will likely be even more investment options for those trying to harness the tech industry's power in a way that makes sense for their financial future. Consider each asset's place in a well-diversified portfolio to create a tailored strategy that captures the tech sector's innovation and manages volatility.",

        "header": "Balancing Growth and Safety: How To Build a Resilient Tech Portfolio",
        "content": "To build lasting wealth, you need a resilient portfolio\u2014especially in tech, where rapid innovation and public sentiment can swing markets fast. In 2025, stocks have ping-ponged up and down in response to uncertainty aroundtariff policies.For example, in May 2025,Tesla surged 17% in a single week. However, the stock is still down over 13% this year amid mounting brand backlash and slumping international sales. Even industry giants aren\u2019t immune to turbulence. So, how do you stay steady in a fast-moving sector like tech? We\u2019ll share simple strategies to help you grow and protect your money\u2014so you can invest confidently, no matter the headlines. Clear investment goals are the foundation of a resilientfinancial portfolio. Are you investing long-term, or do you need access to your money in just a few years? Defining yourtime horizon and objectiveshelps guide your strategy, align your risk tolerance, and keep your portfolio on track\u2014no matter how the market moves. Your timeline depends on factors like age, retirement plans, risk appetite, and liquidity needs. \u201cFor a tech-heavy strategy, we're talking a minimum of 10-12 years, maybe even more,\u201d saidSteven Rog\u00e9, CFP. \u201cThis isn't just an arbitrary number; it's the kind of timeframe that can help you weather the sector's notorious volatility and, hopefully, actually see the growth materialize.\u201d Once your timeline and goals are clear, you can align your tech investments accordingly. Long-term investors might consider high-growth but volatile areas like AI. Shorter-term investors may lean toward more established tech names\u2014like Apple or Microsoft\u2014or diversified techexchange-traded funds (ETFs)that can help smooth out the ride. The next step is building your portfolio with the right mix of core investment types: stocks (equities), bonds (fixed income), and cash (cash equivalents). Each plays a distinct role in balancing growth, income, and stability. Most investors benefit from adiversified mixof these components, adjusted to match their time horizon and comfort with risk. For example, a long-term tech investor might lean heavily on equities, while someone with shorter-term needs could prioritize bonds and cash. Getting the mix right is foundational to your overall strategy and to navigating the market's ups and downs with confidence. Diversification is one of the most practical ways to manage risk. By spreading your assets across different investments, you\u2019re not depending on just one part of the market. \u201cWithin tech, that means going beyond just owning a few big names,\u201d saidMichelle Hobart, founder at Fairfield Coastal Financial. \u201cIt\u2019s about spreading your exposure across different sectors and market caps.\u201d \u201cRight now, semiconductors are in the spotlight because they\u2019re the backbone of AI. But you also have more traditional sectors like systems software, with companies like Microsoft and Apple that offer consistency and scale. These areas behave differently, which helps reduce concentrated risk.\u201d Hobart continued, \u201cMarket cap is another key layer. Large-cap tech tends to be more stable, while small- and micro-cap names come with higher volatility\u2014but also greater potential for growth. By intentionally blending both sector and size, you build a more resilient and balanced tech allocation.\u201d While you can\u2019t avoid every risk, adiversified portfoliohelps you avoid putting all your eggs in one basket. This matters in every sector, especially in tech, where strategies and leadership change often. Over time, your investments will grow at different rates, causing your portfolio to drift from its target allocation.Rebalancingbrings it back in line with your goals and risk tolerance. You don\u2019t need to react to every market swing. Instead, review your portfolio once or twice a year\u2014or when an asset class shifts more than 5% from its target (e.g., from 70/30 stocks/bonds to 80/20 after a strong rally). The recent AI boom shows how this happens: NVIDIA and Microsoft surged between January 2024 and January 2025, potentially leaving your portfolio overweight in just a few stocks.Rebalancing helps reduce concentration risk by trimming winners and reallocating to underrepresented areas. There are a few ways to do this: Consider potential capital gains and transaction fees if you\u2019re rebalancing in a taxable account. Many investors rebalance withintax-advantaged accountsto avoid these costs. Rebalancing isn\u2019t about market timing\u2014it\u2019s about discipline. It helps you manage risk and keeps your portfolio aligned with your strategy, not market momentum. Even a well-structured tech portfolio needs to account for broader market forces. Inflation, global events, and changes within the industry can affect performance in ways that asset allocation alone can\u2019t handle. Tech stocks are some of the first to react to inflation. Rising bond yields reduce the present value of future earnings, which tends to hit growth stocks hardest. For instance, in March 2025, inflation fears and new tariff concerns triggered a broad tech sell-off, as investors anticipated tighter monetary policy and shrinking profit margins. Major names like Amazon, Tesla, NVIDIA, Microsoft, and Apple all saw declines, fueling market caution. Tech stocks are closely tied to global markets and supply chains. In December 2024, NVIDIA fell 2.5% after a Chinese antitrust probe, highlighting tensions between the U.S. and China. Tariffs, sanctions, or supply disruptions can impact performance. Staying informed helps you gauge when a shift warrants action\u2014like rebalancing or trimming a position\u2014and when it\u2019s best to stay the course. Tech moves fast\u2014and so do its risks. When Meta\u2019s metaverse pivot fell flat, its stock dropped 19%.Regulators in the U.S. and Europe are also tightening scrutiny around competition and data use, with Alphabet and Amazon under investigation. New rules could raise compliance costs or pressure profits. All sectors carry risk, but tech\u2019s can escalate quickly. Staying informed helps you adapt\u2014whether that means adjusting your holdings or sticking with your long-term plan. As your investments grow, portfolio management tools can streamline the process. For a hands-off approach, robo-advisors like Wealthfront and Schwab Intelligent Portfolios automatically build, rebalance, and tax-optimize based on your goals and risk tolerance. Prefer more control? Platforms like Sharesight or Kubera let you track performance, dividends, and allocation across brokers. You can set alerts and monitor concentrated positions\u2014especially useful if you're tech-heavy. Managing across accounts or currencies? Tools likeQuickenor Personal Capital (now Empower)\u00a0 provide a full financial overview in one dashboard. No tool replaces your judgment or a financial advisor\u2019s expert opinion, but they help reduce friction and keep you aligned with your strategy. A60/40 portfolioallocates 60% of assets to stocks and 40% to bonds. It aims to balance growth and stability but may under-represent the higher volatility and growth potential common in tech portfolios. The 5% rule in investing advises that no single investment should make up more than 5% of your overall portfolio.This approach helps limit overexposure to any one asset, encouraging diversification as a way to manage risk while still aiming for steady, long-term returns. Common investment risks include market risk, inflation risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, and sector-specific risk. Tech investors often face additional challenges like rapid innovation cycles and regulatory uncertainty. Diversifying across asset classes, sectors, and geographies can reduce risk. Focus on quality companies with strong fundamentals, adjust your allocations as conditions change, and maintain a long-term perspective. There\u2019s no single formula for building a resilient tech portfolio, but the strategies outlined here will help. If you're just starting out, choose higher-growth tech opportunities. As your needs change, gradually move toward more stable assets. Since each investor's situation is unique, the right asset mix will always depend on your goals, time horizon, and comfort with risk. When in doubt, consider professional guidance. The goal is to manage risk well enough to stay invested for the long haul.",

        "content": "A new survey found that consumers have limits on tariff-related price increases, and these limits could vary by generation. Six in ten consumers said they wouldn\u2019t pay more than an additional 10% on products impacted by tariffs, according to a survey from e-commerce firm ESW.An even greater majority (70%) said they plan to reduce overall spending once tariffs begin to have an effect. However, the generations are expected to react to tariffs differently. The report comes as President Donald Trump has placedtariffson severalU.S. trading partners and products, even as some have been adjusted or paused whilenegotiations take place. Trump has said the move will help reinvigorate U.S. manufacturing and bring in needed tax revenue.\u00a0However, economists have said that thetariffs could lead to price increasesas businesses pass some of the cost of the tariffs onto consumers. \"Rather than alienating customers and risking market share, firms are hoping tariffs are dropped and costs go down,\" wrote Moody's Economist Matt Colyar on Monday. \"This is a short-term salve for consumers who have not yet seen broad-based price hikes in response to U.S. trade policy, but firms indicate it will not be sustained long term.\" Younger shoppers were particularly inclined to slow their spending if tariffs push up prices. The survey found that more than three-in-four Millennials, aged 30 to 44, and Gen Zers, aged 18 to 29, said they planned to tighten their belts to combat higher costs from tariffs. Gen Z shoppers were the most likely to stock up on goods now before tariffs hit, with electronics and grocery purchases being their highest priorities. Over a quarter of Millennials said they would seekBuy Now, Pay Laterservices to contend with tariff-induced price increases. Meanwhile, more than half of Baby Boomers, defined as over the age of 60, are looking to purchase fewer imported goods as a result of tariffs. \u201cOur data finds that younger, Gen Z consumers are far more likely than older Boomers to feel unprepared for price hikes, and have already curtailed their spending in anticipation,\u201d\u00a0 said Eric Eichmann, ESW chief executive officer, in a statement. Discretionary items are the most likely to be cut from consumers' budgets if tariffs raise their prices, with 68% saying electronic purchases were the most likely to be skipped, followed by clothing and home goods. Groceries and pet supplies were the items that consumers were most likely to keep buying, regardless of how tariffs impact the prices. \u201cPrice-sensitive consumers, especially Millennials and Gen Z, are quick to reassess purchases that can be delayed or substituted,\u201d the report found.",

        "content": "Congressional stock trading reports show that two allies of President Trump added Tesla (TSLA) shares in May as the relationship between the president and Elon Musk began to show signs of strain but before a falling out between the two men triggered a stock price drop. The most recently disclosed trades by Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Rob Bresnahan of Pennsylvania \u2014 moves that both lawmakers say were made by financial advisers without their input \u2014 for now appear to have resulted in a loss for the lawmakers. They are the latest in a pattern of congressional purchases of Tesla stock that continued up until at least three weeks ago,according to a disclosure tracker at Quiver Quantitative. Members of Congress have 30 days by law to disclose their personal trades and those of their families \u2014 suggesting more recent activity could yet be in the offing. The trades from Rep. Bresnahan were disclosed Tuesdayin a new filingand are notable after the freshman lawmaker campaigned in his recent run for Congress in part on prohibiting the practice but has since emerged asone of Capitol Hill's more prolific traders. A spokesperson for Rep. Bresnahan said Tuesday that the lawmaker uses a financial adviser and that he is not aware of trades until they are disclosed. He also previously announced he wouldmove his assets into a blind trustand is currently working with the House Committee on Ethics to enact his plans there. Rep. Greene also told Yahoo Finance in a statement, \"I have signed a fiduciary agreement to allow my financial advisor to control my investments. All of my investments are reported with full transparency. I refuse to hide my stock trades in a blind trust like many others do. Since my portfolio manager makes my trades for me, I usually find out about them when the media asks.\u201d Rep. Bresnahan's brokerage account made eight disclosed trades of Tesla this year. He bought shares in April and May after selling shares in February and March. The exact value of his shares are unknown, as the law only requires lawmakers to report transactions within a range of values. Each of Bresnahan's trades were in the range of $1,001-$15,000. Bresnahan's disclosure on Tuesday revealed over 50 recent trades, including purchases of Nvidia (NVDA), JPMorgan (JPM), and Meta (META). The trading could also be a political liability for Bresnahan who won his seat last year by less that two percentage points. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee immediately highlighting the trades with spokesperson Eli Cousin telling Yahoo Finance the trades are \"the reason why he will be a one-term member of Congress.\" Greene, meanwhile, has been a consistent buyer of Tesla all year. Her disclosures also reveal eight trades this year, all purchases in that same range of $1,001-$15,000. Both lawmakers also have significant overlap with Elon Musk and his business interests. Greene is the chair of aHouse DOGE subcommittee, where she has loudly supported Musk's efforts. Some of her more vocal comments \u2014 such as urging on Trump administration investigations into violent Tesla protests \u2014 have raised questions among some ethics expertswho recently noted to Forbesthat House ethics rules currently prohibit lawmakers from taking action to benefit their own financial interest. Bresnahansits on the House's transportation committee,which is involved in issues related to both Tesla and another of Musk's companies, SpaceX (SPAX.PVT). This week's disclosure is the latest twist in a debate around the ethics of lawmakers trading stocks that has raged for years \u2014 from some high-profile trades in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic to a renewed focus recently whendata showed lawmaker trading activity spikingas Trump roiled markets with his \"Liberation Day\" tariffs. Two of the most prolific traders in that recent stretch of tariff-fueled trading \u2014 aWall Street Journal analysis found\u2014 were Bresnahan and Democrat Ro Khanna of California. Both lawmakers have previously supported banning the practice. Khanna also purchased Tesla stock as recently as April, according to the Quiver Quantitative tallies. House Speaker Mike Johnson alsorecently saidhe is supportive of efforts toward a stock trading ban but didn't say whether he will bring up the effort for a House vote. Another prominent supporter is Trump, who has said he would sign a ban if it reached his desk. One bill,called the TRUST in Congress Act, would require lawmakers and their spouses and children to place certain assets into blind trusts. The billcurrently has 76 cosponsors, with 62 Democrats and 14 Republicans supportive. But that bill has been introduced repeatedly in recent years without seeing action as lawmakers from both parties express support for the idea of stock bans even while continuing to trade. Bresnahan was elected to his first term in Congress last year and has emerged as just the most recent example. Heexpressed support for a ban on the campaign trail last year, writing at the time that \"the idea that we can buy and sell stocks while voting on legislation that will have a direct impact on these companies is wrong and needs to come to an end immediately.\" Since entering Congress, Bresnahan hasalso unveiled a planthat would ban members of Congress and their spouses from trading while in office but allow them to keep existing holdings, calling it the Transparency in Representation through Uniform Stock Trading Ban (TRUST) Act.

        "content": "Less than half (40%) of Americans in retirement believe they have saved enough, according to the Schroders' 2025 U.S. Retirement Survey.However, even if you feel confident about your retirement savings, inflation could take a bite out of them. Once you stop working, you may feel theeffects of inflationmore since you may be living on a fixed income. In June 2022, theinflationrate in the U.S. peaked at 9.06%. This was the highest level of inflation in over four decades, since inflation hit 14.76% in March 1980.Today, inflation hovers around 2.3%, which is slightly above the Federal Reserve\u2019s target rate of 2%. Shifting your investment strategy and maintaining a well-diversified portfolio in retirement is crucial to combating the effects of inflation. Let\u2019s talk more about inflation, how it works, and strategic investment strategies you can implement to combat it.  Inflation measures how much more expensive goods and services become each year.An increase in inflation can erode purchasing power as the cost of living goes up. This can be especially problematic for retirees on fixed incomes and could hinder achieving certain retirement goals. However, there are several wise investments you can make as a retiree to combat inflation and maintain financial security in your golden years. Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS) are securities designed to protect you against the effects of inflation. Unlike other Treasury-backed securities that have a fixed principal, their value can fluctuate over the fixed term linked to theConsumer Price Index (CPI). When TIPS mature, you get the increased amount if the principal is greater than the original amount. If the principal is equal to or lower than the original amount, you still get the original amount. TIPS are typically offered for terms of 5, 10, or 30 years. While TIPS are not designed to be a profitable long-term investment, they can be a smart addition to a diversified portfolio and act as a hedge against inflation, especially if you\u2019re nearing or entering retirement. Maintaining sufficient cash reserves in ahigh-yield savings account, a CD, or both is important to maintain liquidity and meet short-term needs, especially when living on a fixed income. Generally, it\u2019s smart to save at least six to 12 months' worth of monthly expenses, more if you can. Short-term bonds are bonds that mature in one to three years.They tend to come with lower risks, particularly those issued by the U.S. Treasury, and can be used to protect capital during inflationary periods and potentially generate income. Although bond prices do fluctuate, bonds are typically less volatile than stocks. Equityinvestments, or stocks, offer a long-term hedge against inflation. When people refer to \u201cthe market,\u201d they\u2019re often referring to theS&P 500index, which is a strong indicator of overall stock market performance. This index tracks the performance of around 500 of the largest publicly traded companies in the U.S. and has seen an average annual return of about 10% for decades. Besides average annual return, some stocks may pay dividends, which can create a consistent stream of passive income to further compound financial growth. However, investing always comes with risk, and stocks are no exception. There\u2019s no guarantee of a return, and you could lose money. As you near retirement, focusing onconservative investmentswith a track record of consistent growth can reduce your risk while also helping you beat the effects of inflation. Real estate is another smart retirement investment. If you\u2019re a homeowner, renting out part of your home, such as a basement apartment, can be a hedge against inflation since rental prices typically increase with inflation. It\u2019s a great way to add another income stream to your portfolio. At the same time, it\u2019s important to understand the difference betweenmonetizingreal estate that you already own, and investing in a real estate property. Toturn a profit on an investment property, the value of the property must increase more than inflation plus the interest rate on the loan, which could add up to 8.5%, or even as high as 10.5%. Some ways for retirees to invest in real estate include renting out part of their home, purchasing an investment property, and becoming a landlord, or purchasing shares ofreal estate investment trusts (REITs), ETFs, and mutual funds. Awell-diversifiedportfolio is crucial to mitigate financial risk and enhance financial returns in an inflationary environment. Investing in various assets, including stocks, mutual funds, bonds, real estate, and more, provides a hedge against significant losses and may help shield you from market swings and economic downturns. Other ways to manage investment risk include a periodic portfolio review with the help of afinancial advisorandasset allocation adjustmentsover time. As you approach retirement, it becomes more important to allocate more of your funds toward conservative investments with a solid track record of long-term growth versus riskier investments such as buying shares of stock in an emerging company or sector. Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS) may lose value in a deflationary environment, which may result in lower returns compared to other types of investments. They also tend to be sensitive to interest rate changes, which can affect market prices if you sell before maturity. Retirees can maintain liquidity by keeping some of their assets in cash reserves and short-term investments while allocating the rest to a diversified investment strategy focused on long-term growth. Generally, retirees may want to review their investment portfolios at least once per year, or after a significant life change or market downturn, with the help of a financial advisor. Consistent reviews can help retirees manage their risk tolerance and income needs as they age. Understanding inflation and how it can affect your investments is key to creating an investment strategy that results in long-term growth for your retirement. Whether it\u2019s bonds, real estate, or TIPS, there are different investment options to carefully consider. There\u2019s no one-size-fits-all investment strategy for everyone. It\u2019s wise to consult a financial advisor to tailor various investment strategies to your needs.",

The two sides were hammering out technical details of an agreement, according to reports.\u201cWe\u2019re working on all sorts of trade issues, and I think talks are going really, really well,\u201d\u00a0 and could continue Wednesday, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told reporters, according toThe Wall Street Journal.The ongoing talks between the two economic superpowers reassured investors,boosting stocksTuesday on the prospect of lowering the tit-for-tat trade barriers the two countries have put up in recent months. A key aim for the U.S. isrestoring access to Chinese rare earth mineralsused to make batteries and advanced electronics. In return, the U.S. reportedly could lift restrictions on exporting jet engine parts, computer chip design software, and other high-tech items to China.The two countries have alsoimposed high import taxes on one another, although some of those are paused while negotiations continue.A breakdown in talks could threaten industrial supply chains in both nations, andcause price hikes and shortagesfor U.S. consumers, according to trade experts.Ironically, the favorable reaction of the stock market to the talks could carry its own risks, according to David Folkerts-Landau, Group Chief Economist at Deutsche Bank.\"One key concern is that the Trump administration, buoyed by the market rebound, may resume aggressive tariff rhetoric\u2014potentially triggering renewed retaliation from China and Europe, as seen earlier this year,\" he wrote in a commentary.Meanwhile, the administration of President Donald Trump is pursuing trade deals with multiple other countries. Less than a month remains until Trump's 90-day pause on his \"Liberation Day\" tariffs expires, which would raise tariffs to double-digit levels ondozens of U.S. trading partners. The outlook for trade talks has become cloudier in recent weeks, as U.S. courts first ruled that many of the tariffs were illegal, only to have another court allow them to proceed while lawsuits play out.Economists have warned the U.S. economy could fall into a recessionif tariffs are restoredto the high levels Trump announced April 2. Both countries have found pain points to exploit in the trade war, according to \u00a0Anthony Rapa, co-chair of the international trade practice at law firm Blank Rome.On the Chinese side, exports of rare earth minerals have hurt U.S. industries, especially automakers. The rare earth restrictions have also hurt U.S. allies, who may be adding diplomatic pressure on Trump to get a deal done, Rapa toldInvestopediain an interview.\"Rare earths have become so essential to the supply chain, and it's been something that I think companies and countries around the world have been concerned about for a long time, which is that China has, for the time being, such a strong position in that part of the supply chain that if they ever were to flex a choke point there, that it could have a really negative impact on the world economy,\" he said.For the U.S., Trump's restrictions targeting Chinese technology companies threaten to hinder China in the international competition to develop artificial intelligence.\"There's a real race regarding AI supremacy, both in terms of the power of the technology and also whose technology is going to be adopted around the world,\" Rapa said. \"And this is stuff that China really cares about. They've got a lot of other concerns too, but this seems to be a sticking point for them.\" Update, June 10, 2025:Updated after publication to add quotes from Howard Lutnick and Anthony Rapa.",

The tech giant, which kicked off its week-long Worldwide Developers Conference on Monday, unveiled several AI-related improvements with iOS 26 but saidenhanced Siri features needed more timeto meet the company\u2019s quality standards. The lack of new Siri updates likely raised concerns that the company, which was slow to roll out its flagship Apple Intelligence software, is losing ground to other tech giants with artificial intelligence and that furtherdelays could slow iPhone sales as consumers postpone their upgrade cycle. The company's keynote presentation Monday delivered \"slow but steady improvements to strategy,\"Wedbush analysts said, \u201cbut overall [it was] a yawner.\" Apple stock is down 19% since the start of 2025, making it the weakest performer among members of theMagnificent Sevengroup of major technology companies, alongside Tesla (TSLA). Apple shares gained 0.6% on Tuesday to close at $202.67, after dropping 1.2% yesterday. Below, we break down thetechnicalson Apple\u2019s chart and point out important price levels worth watching out for. After rebounding from their early-April low, Apple shares have traded mostlysideways, with the price recently forming arising wedge. The price then ran into selling pressure near the downward sloping50-day moving average, potentially setting the stage for a continuation of the stock\u2019s longer-termdowntrendthat started in late December. Meanwhile, therelative strength indexhas struggled to reclaim its neutral threshold, signaling bearish price momentum. Let\u2019s identify importantsupport and resistancelevels on Apple\u2019s chart that investors will likely be watching. Abreakdownbelow the rising wedge could initially see the shares fall to around $193. This area may provide support near the low of the pattern, which also aligns with a range of correspondingprice actionon the chart extending back to May last year. The bulls\u2019 failure to successfully defend this level opens the door for a more significant drop to $180. Bargain hunters may seekbuy-and-holdopportunities in this location near a brief retracement in May last year following abreakaway gapabove the 200-day moving average. This level also sits in the same neighborhood as a measured move downsideprice targetthat calculates the decline inpointsthat preceded the rising wedge and deducts that amount from the pattern\u2019s lower trendline. During upswings in the stock, investors should monitor the $214 level. The shares may encounter overhead selling pressure in this area near severalpeaks and troughsthat formed on the chart between September and May. Finally, a decisive close above this level could see Apple shares climb toward $235. Investors who bought shares at lower prices may look forexit pointsin this region near notable peaks that developed on the chart in July and October last year.

The gain came as theS&P 500(^GSPC0.55%)and theNasdaq Composite(^IXIC0.63%)were both up 0.6%. Positive news from ongoing trade talks between the U.S. and China is helping boost the company's stock as it continues its massive run-up following the revelation of its partnership withNvidia. U.S. and Chinese officials are in London attempting to reach a more permanent resolution to the trade war that was put on pause last month. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said on Tuesday that the discussions were \"going well\" and that the representatives were \"spending lots of time together\" attempting to reach a deal. A permanent reduction of the massive tariffs both countries imposed on each other in recent months would be great news for the entire economy, butsemiconductor companiescould benefit specifically, depending on the details.

Navitas announced last month that Nvidia had selected the company to help power its next-generation artificial intelligence (AI) data center systems, including the much-anticipated Rubin chips that will eventually succeed the current industry-leading Blackwell chips. Navitas, which specializes in gallium nitride (GaN) and silicon carbide (SiC) technologies, will help Nvidia solve key scaling issues with its power supply for the incredibly powerful AI-fueled chips. I think Navitas stock is worth owning; the seal of approval from Nvidia is huge. The company's balance sheet is solid, with minimal debt.",

        "content": "Like many global markets, the UK economy had a volatile start to the year. After trending upward from early January, gaining around 7.4%, the FTSE 100 reversed course in early March, falling about 13% by early April. However, it has since rebounded, gaining approximately 15%, highlighting renewed investor confidence and a positive shift in the UK\u2019s economic outlook. The British economy grew more than expected in first-quarter 2025, largely driven by the services sector. Recent trade agreements with India, the United States, and the EU provide a strong tailwind for the U.K. economy, potentially supporting an upgrade to its growth outlook. With rising uncertainty over tariff policies and growing fears of an economic slowdown, investors have turned their attention away from U.S. assets, another factor driving increased attention toward alternative markets like the U.K. On Monday, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang expressed strong admiration for U.K.\u2019s economy, as quoted on CNBC, remarking the economy to be in a goldilocks situation. According to CNBC, Nvidia CEO pledged to ramp up investment in the UK economy\u2019s AI industry through his multitrillion-dollar semiconductor company. The U.K. has recently been promoting itself as a future global leader in AI, which can be highlighted by the optimistic comments of the Nvidia CEO. Early in the year, prime minister Keir Starmer introduced an ambitious strategy to strengthen the U.K.\u2019s AI sector, including plans to ease regulations for new data centers and to boost the nation\u2019s computing capacity twentyfold by 2030. Huang\u2019s comments come as a major boost for the U.K., as he heaped praise on that country\u2019s thriving AI ecosystem. While speaking on a panel, as quoted on CNBC, Huang went on to say that the ability to develop AI supercomputers in the U.K. will spark greater interest from startups. Amid global uncertainty, the British economy has demonstrated notable resilience. Further igniting investor interest is British finance minister Rachel Reeves\u2019s proposed $2.7 trillion spending plan. Per projections by the IMF, as quoted on Reuters, U.K.\u2019s growth is expected to slightly outpace the Eurozone. However, it will trail behind the United States and Canada. According to Allan Monks, JPMorgan\u2019s chief U.K. economist, as quoted on CNBC, a series of positive developments could help lift UK economic growth for the entire second quarter. Investors can increase their portfolio exposure to the U.K. with pure-play ETFs, namely,iShares MSCIUnited Kingdom ETFEWU,Franklin FTSE United Kingdom ETFFLGB,First Trust United KingdomAlphaDEX FundFKU andiShares MSCI United Kingdom Small-Cap ETFEWUS.

        "header": "Tesla Has a Leg Up on Self-Driving Car Competitors, Says Goldman Sachs Ahead of Robotaxi Launch",
        "content": "Tesla investors on Tuesday were putting last week's feud between CEO Elon Musk and President Trump in the rearview mirror and looking ahead to what they hope will be the EV maker's next growth driver. Tesla (TSLA) shares surged Tuesday, rising nearly 6% for their third straight day of big gains, in anticipation of the launch of its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas. The company expects to operate 10 to 20 vehicles starting this week, and grow the fleet in the coming months. Goldman Sachs analysts in a note on Tuesday said the EV maker could have two advantages in the AV market. First, the scale of its existing business and certain design choices\u2014Tesla uses custom silicon and does not use lidar or radar to navigate\u2014could make its vehicles significantly less expensive than the competition. Second, its \u201cend to end AI training approach\u201d could facilitate faster scaling by creating an adaptable software that uses reasoning, not programming, to understand new environments. Tesla has set aggressive scaling targets for its AV business. The company plans to enter markets beyond Austin before the end of the year, and CEO Elon Musk expects to have \u201chundreds of thousands\u201d of AVs on the road by the end of next year. Tesla expects operating costs at scale to be about 40 cents per mile. Goldman Sachs has more modest expectations. The firm estimates the average AV\u2019s depreciation, insurance, and remote operator costs currently total about $1.34 per mile, and they don\u2019t expect those costs to decrease to 40 cents until about 2040. They also expect Tesla will have about 2,500 robotaxis in service by the end of 2027. Goldman is not alone in thinking Tesla\u2019s targets are unrealistic. Bairddowngraded Tesla stockon Monday, citing \u201clofty expectations\u201d as a primary reason. \u201cWe believe Musk's comments regarding the robotaxi ramp rate are a bit too optimistic, and we believe this excitement has been priced into shares,\u201d wrote research analyst Ben Kallo. A lot is riding on the success of Tesla\u2019s robotaxi service. Musk has been insisting for more than a year that Tesla's core business is AI and robotics, not cars. The company began production of its Dojo Supercomputer in 2023, and in 2024 beganprioritizing its robotaxi serviceover the development of a low-cost, human-driven EV model. Anticipation of the robotaxi rollout has buoyed Tesla's share price ever since despite mounting troubles. Salesslumpedin the first quarter amid increased competition and aconsumer backlashto Musk\u2019s work with the Trump administration. The stock lost more than half of its value between hitting anall-time high in Decemberand early April whenstocks nosedivedafter Trump unveiled steep tariffs on most of the world\u2019s goods. Shares rebounded in late April and May after Musk promised tospend less time in Washington. But the stock took another hit earlier this month when Musk and the presidentsparred onlineover the impact thetax billworking its way through Congress could have on America\u2019s fiscal deficit. The public spat jeopardized Musk\u2019s amiable relationship with the president, which was a key reason many Tesla investors looked past weak sales and an uncertain outlook. Gene Munster and Brian Baker of Deepwater Research said in a note last week they do not anticipate Musk's feud with Trump will derail Tesla's AV leadership. The White House, they said, \"has little to gain in standing in front of autonomy\" considering the race between the U.S. and China to be the global leader in artificial intelligence. \"The bottom line, [we] expect cooler heads to prevail and the Federal Government will continue to support the growth of these services.\"",
