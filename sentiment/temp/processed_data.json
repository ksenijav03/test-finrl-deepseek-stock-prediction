        "content": "WhileNvidia,Palantir Technologies, andTeslaconsistently find their names in headlines regarding artificial intelligence (AI), I would argue that one company that dwarfs the attention garnered by big tech isOpenAI-- the start-up that kicked off the AI revolution in the first place. Recently, OpenAI sent shockwaves around the AI landscape yet again. This time, however, it wasn't because the ChatGPT developer released another groundbreaking product aimed at its rivals. Rather, investors learned that OpenAI is teaming up with ...Alphabet. Below, I'm going to detail why thepartnership between OpenAI and Alphabetis such a big deal. Moreover, I'll break down which AI data center stock I think is poised to benefit most from this deal. Let's dig in. You may recall that when OpenAI emerged a few years ago,Microsoftwas fast to partner with the company. More specifically,Microsoft plowed $10 billion into OpenAIas part of a strategic investment. One of the cornerstones of this deal was integrating ChatGPT into Microsoft's cloud platform, Azure. Throughout their partnership, OpenAI's compute infrastructure fortrainingandinferencingwas primarily supported by Microsoft. With Google entering the picture, however, those dynamics have changed. OpenAI is branching out beyond Microsoft and now leveraging the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to complement Azure for compute resources. While this is a huge win for Alphabet's cloud business -- which rivals both Azure andAmazonWeb Services (AWS) -- I see an even bigger winner emerging from this partnership. Image source: Getty Images. While Nvidia,Advanced Micro Devices, andBroadcomhave been critical sources of high-performance chipsets for data centers throughout the AI revolution, a new player is emerging as a key resource in the space. CoreWeave(CRWV-1.00%)provides critical infrastructure services to AI developers through a cloud-based model. Companies that may not have the time or financial resources to acquire graphics processing units (GPU) from Nvidia and its peers can essentially rent them from CoreWeave's cloud-based infrastructure. Image Source: CoreWeave Investor Relations. Per the graph above, the 63% increase in CoreWeave'sremaining performance obligations(RPO) suggests demand for infrastructure services is strong. However, there's a bit more to those figures above. Back in March,CoreWeave signed an $11.2 billion dealwith (wait for it!)... OpenAI. Following the news of OpenAI's partnership with Google Cloud, further reporting outlined that CoreWeave is playing a role in this deal, too. CoreWeave is reportedly supplying compute power to Alphabet, which the company will then resell to OpenAI as part of the new cloud deal structure. As I outlined inthis piece here, infrastructure services represent the next big tailwind along the AI spectrum. While OpenAI may continue to make the headlines as it inks new deals and further migrates from an overreliance on Microsoft, investors should keep a keen eye on how CoreWeave might also emerge as a subtle winner from these partnerships. Wall Street's consensus estimates for CoreWeave suggest an incredibly bullish outlook. It's rare for a company to triple its revenue and transition to profitability in a matter of just a couple of years. Now that CoreWeave is working closely with OpenAI, I suspect the company will become increasingly scrutinized as more AI infrastructure deals come to light. For these reasons, I think there is a lot riding on CoreWeave's ability to meet or exceed the forecasts below.  CRWV Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Yeardata byYCharts While CoreWeave is a rising star in the AI realm and the company's outlook is bright, smart investors will recall that the company went public just a few months ago. Broadly speaking, IPO stocks can exhibit pronounced levels of momentum as hype around the new stock rises. With a stock price gain of nearly 300% in just two months, I thinkCoreWeave stock is overbought right now. Although I like the company as a long-term investment, I would encourage investors to exercise some patience and wait for a pullback before piling into the stock.",

Barclays expects Nvidia\u2019s compute revenue to grow in the mid-teens for the October and January quarters, with its Blackwell Ultra chips on track\u2014small volumes arriving by quarter\u2019s end and mass production set for Q3. The analysts anticipate that the launch of Ultra chips and higher Blackwell shipments will drive an increase in Nvidia's gross margins in the second half of the year. Although the adjusted gross margin fell from 78.9% to 61% in the fiscal first quarter, they expect it to improve as the year progresses. Why It Matters: Nvidia\u2019s stock has shown significant resilience and growth potential in the past. The company\u2019s market capitalization rebounded to $3.3 trillion in May 2025, following a steep drop earlier in the year. In June, Nvidia overtook Microsoft to become the world\u2019s most valuable publicly traded company, with a market cap of $3.4 trillion. The company\u2019s AI market leadership and growing opportunities in sovereign AI were showcased at GTC Paris, as noted by aJPMorgananalyst. These factors, coupled with the successful ramp-up of the Blackwell AI platform, underpin Barclays\u2019 bullish outlook on Nvidia. The revised price target of Barclays is based on increased earnings projections for the next calendar year and a higher valuation multiple in the analysts\u2019 model.

GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. Shares have climbed more than 3,000% over the past five years, and are currently trading near all-time highs. Rosenblatt Securities analyst Hans Mosesmann maintained a $200 price target this week, while UBS and Goldman Sachs pointed to Nvidia's dominant position in AI hardware as reason for long-term upside. Nvidia controls more than 80% of the AI accelerator market and reported a 427% year-over-year jump in data center revenue in its latest quarter. That segment is critical to generative AI and cloud infrastructure buildouts, bolstering Nvidia's top line and free cash flow which now exceeds Amazon's. The company's proprietary CUDA software, tight integration with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., and leading-edge GPUs like the H100 and upcoming Blackwell series reinforce its pricing power and market moat. Nvidia also reported more than $14 billion in quarterly profits, helping justify its $2.9 trillion market cap as of June 18. A doubling in valuation would place it in direct competition with Apple (AAPL,Financials) and Microsoft (MSFT,Financials) as the world's most valuable public firm.

        "header": "10 Reasons to Pass on Nvidia Stock From an Investor of 27 Years Who's Seen This Story Play Out Before",
        "content": "Not long after my 18th birthday, I opened my first brokerage account with E*TRADE. In just a few months,I'll be celebrating my 27th year as an investor, and my 28th, in total, following what makes stocks and the market tick. I can say, without question, there's always something new to learn and a stock that can prove a person wrong. For example, I've been decisively skeptical of the face of theartificial intelligence (AI)revolution,Nvidia(NVDA0.87%). All Nvidia has done is blow naysayer commentary out of the water and tack on more than $3 trillion in market cap since 2023 began. Nvidia's Hopper (H100) and Blackwell graphics processing units (GPUs) have been the undeniable top options by businesses operating AI-accelerated data centers. Image source: Getty Images. But I've also seen stories like Nvidia's play out before. While the hype surrounding game-changing innovations can appear insurmountable, there aretangible, historical, and statistical reasons to believe Nvidia is, indeed, fallible. What follows are 10 reasons to pass on Nvidia stock from an investor who's seen a lot of next-big-thing trends come and go over 27 years. History offers one the most compelling reasons to keep your distance from Nvidia stock. Since (and including) the advent of the internet in the mid-1990s, every major technological leap forward has resulted in an early stage bubbleeventually(keyword!) forming and bursting. Although it's impossible to know when this bubble will burst ahead of time,next-big-thing trends and bubbles have gone hand-in-hand for more than three decades. The simple fact that most businesses haven't yet optimized their AI solutions and aren't generating a profit on their AI investments strongly suggests that investors have, once again, overestimated the adoption rate and early innings utility of a game-changing innovation. That's bad news for Nvidia. Though Nvidia accounts for a near-monopoly like share of the GPUs currently deployed in AI accelerated data centers, it's unlikely to stay that way for long. Nvidia's has sold all the GPUs it can for 2025, which means hardware-hungry businesses will look elsewhere to gain an edge. External providers likeAdvanced Micro Devices(AMD-0.20%)arerapidly ramping up production and introducing new AI-accelerating chips. AMD's Instinct series chips are notably cheaper and more readily accessible than Nvidia's hardware, which suggests it should have no issue chipping away (pun fully intended) at Nvidia's leading data center market share. However, the argument can be made thatinternal competition is an even bigger threat to Nvidia's future-- and one of the top reasons to pass on its stock. Many of Nvidia's top clients by net sales are internally developing AI-GPUs and solutions to use in their data centers. While these chips won't be competing against Hopper and Blackwell externally, they will be taking up valuable data center real estate that Nvidia won't be able to win. Further, the internally developed hardware by Nvidia's leading customers is considerably cheaper than Hopper and Blackwell. Normally, innovation is everything for tech companies. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is sparing no expense to ensure that his company maintains its compute advantages. Huang is attempting to bring a new advanced AI-GPU to market annually, with Blackwell Ultra debuting later this year, followed by Vera Rubin and Vera Rubin Ultra in 2026 and 2027, respectively. The concern is thatHuang's accelerated innovation cycle will quickly depreciate prior-generation chipsand coerce businesses to trade down to less-costly options. Bringing a new chip to market annually might also irritate key customers, which may choose to delay their upgrade cycles.  NVDA Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly)data byYCharts. Nvidia's biggest competitive edge in AI has been its ability to exploit AI-GPU scarcity. As long as GPU demand overwhelms supply, Nvidia can notably increase its prices, boost its production, and benefit from both ends. Butwe're already observing evidence that AI-GPU scarcity is waning. Although world-leading chip fabrication companyTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturingstill can't satiate demand despite rapidly expanding its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate capacity, Nvidia has delivered four consecutive quarters of declining generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)gross margin. While the company expects a modest rebound in GAAP gross margin for the current quarter, this four-quarter decline points to external and internal competition reducing the AI-GPU scarcity Nvidia holds so dear. Another reason to consider passing on Nvidia stock is because of ongoing export restrictions to China, which is one of the company's most important individual markets and generates billions of dollars in quarterly sales. What makesexport restrictions on high-powered AI chipsso unique is that it's one of the few policies the Joe Biden administration and Donald Trump administration have seen eye-to-eye on. For three years, the federal government has stymied exports of Nvidia's top AI hardware to the world's No. 2 economy. With President Trump focused on national security and making the U.S. an artificial intelligence leader, it seems highly unlikely that these restrictions will be eased anytime soon. Image source: Getty Images. In addition to Nvidia having key products restricted for export to China, President Trump's tariff and trade policy threatens to throw a monkey wrench into the company's expansion plans. Implementing a sweeping global tariff, along with higher \"reciprocal tariff rates\" for select countries that have historically had adverse trade imbalances with America, runs the risk of worsening trade relations with key partners, and may incite anti-American sentiment toward certain goods. To boot, tariffs may be placed on semiconductors and/or various aspects of the AI supply chain, which can ultimately weaken Nvidia's gross margin. If you need another tangible excuse to pass on Nvidia stock, look no further than the company's insider trading activity, which is required to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In December 2020, two sons of Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress each purchased 100 shares of Nvidia. This purchase,which occurred more than 54 months ago, is the last time an executive, board member, or direct family member, bought shares. In comparison, there have been 172 separate sales by insiders since Kress's Form 4 was filed in 2020. While there are plenty of reasons to sell a stock (not all of which are worrisome), there's only one reason to buy: you believe shares will head higher. If Nvidia's insiders aren't buying, why should you? With one exception --billionaire Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management-- Wall Street's brightest billionaire money managers have been persistent sellers of Nvidia stock for more than a year. This includes Stanley Druckenmiller of Duquesne Family Office and Stephen Mandel of Lone Pine Capital, both of which completely exited their once sizable positions in this AI kingpin. Though billionaire investors are fully capable of being wrong, it's noteworthy that an overwhelming majority of big-money hedge funds have cashed in their chips ormeaningfully reduced their positions, as is the case with David Tepper of Appaloosa, Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management, and Israel Englander of Millennium Management. Some of the above factors may have played a role in their decisions to sell or reduce their exposure.  NVDA PS Ratiodata byYCharts. PS Ratio = price-to-sales ratio. Last but certainly not least, Nvidia's valuation isn't all it's cracked up to be. While its forward price-to-earnings ratio of 25 isn't egregiously high, its trailing-12-month (TTM)price-to-sales (P/S) ratioof 24 remains in nosebleed territory, relative to other megacap stocks that have been on the leading edge of next-big-thing trends. For instance, key players in the evolution of the internet, such asAmazon,Microsoft, andCisco Systems, all topped out with TTM P/S ratios ranging from 30 to 43 before the dot-com bubble burst. Perhaps not coincidentally, Nvidia's TTM P/S ratio peaked at 42 last summer. Nevertheless, aP/S ratio of 24 is still far too high, based on historical data, to be sustainable.",

        "content": "While there is still some uncertainty in the market related to tariffs, the U.S. economy, and a new conflict in the Middle East, now can still be a good time to invest in growth stocks. Investors just need to take a more cautious approach by investing smaller amounts, say $1,000, and then look to add to their positions later if the stocks dip in price. Let's look at five growth stocks investors might want to begin accumulating shares in right now with a $1,000 initial investment. Image source: Getty Images. Nvidia(NVDA0.87%)remains the clear leader in powering theartificial intelligence (AI)infrastructure buildout. With its powerful parallel processing capabilities, Nvidia'sgraphic processing units (GPUs)have become the main chips used to run AI workloads. Nvidia's real moat isn't its powerful chips, however -- it'sCUDA, its proprietary software platform that developers have been trained on for nearly two decades. Over time, Nvidia layered on CUDA X, a collection of AI tools and libraries that make its chips even more efficient for AI tasks. This combination of dominant hardware and sticky software helped Nvidia capture over 90% of the GPU market in the first quarter. As AI demand surged, Nvidia's data center revenue exploded, growing more than 9x in two years. That momentum shows no signs of slowing. Nvidia's new Blackwell chips are ramping faster than any product in the company's history, and demand for its full-stack AI \"factories\" continues to accelerate. In addition, it's gaining traction with automakers, offering a second potential growth engine. While a slowdown in data center spending is a risk, Nvidia remains the best way to invest in the AI infrastructure buildout. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(TSM-0.17%), more commonly known as TSMC, has quietly become one of the most important companies in the world. As the go-to manufacturer for advanced AI chips, it's playing a critical role in the AI infrastructure buildout. While Nvidia designs chips, TSMC is the one actually making them, and few other companies have its capabilities in this area. TSMC's chip manufacturing expertise is paying off. Efficiently making advanced semiconductors at scale is a difficult business that requires not only manufacturing expertise but also technological know-how. Chips for high-performance computing now make up nearly 60% of TSMC's business, and demand remains strong. TSMC continues to work closely with key customers like Nvidia to expand future capacity, which should help extend its lead. There are some near-term margin pressures from its U.S. fab ramp-up, but the company is already raising prices to help offset that and looks poised to be a long-term AI winner. Pinterest(PINS0.62%)has undergone a meaningful transformation over the past few years. The company has embraced AI and leaned into making the platform more shoppable, which is starting to pay off. Engagement is up,average revenue per user (ARPU)is improving, and the company is finally starting to better monetize its massive international user base through the help of a partnership withAlphabet's Google. The company's turnaround is a direct result of its new AI solutions, both on the front end and back end. Pinterest has invested heavily in AI-driven personalization, visual search, and recommendation systems, all of which are helping improve user engagement. Meanwhile, on the back end, its Performance+ solution integrates AI tools and automation to help advertisers run more effective campaigns and improve conversions. While the company is not immune to an economic and ad market slowdown, with a huge user base and growing momentum, Pinterest has strong upside in front of it. Eli Lilly(LLY-0.89%)continues to be one of the biggest winners from the explosive growth in GLP-1 drugs. Last quarter, its Mounjaro and Zepbound drugs drove a combined $6.1 billion in revenue, with Zepbound surging from just $517 million a year ago to $2.3 billion. The momentum behind GLP-1s shows no signs of slowing, and Lilly's expanding international rollout of Mounjaro should keep that trend intact. The bigger story for Lilly, though, could be orforglipron. The company's next-generation, oral GLP-1 drug cleared its first phase 3 trial and showed promising weight loss results. The drug has a couple of important advantages over most other GLP-1 drugs on the market. The first is that it is an oral medication, while the most effective GLP-1 weight loss drugs currently on the market are all injectables requiring a needle. Unlike injectable drugs, it also doesn't require injectable pens or need cold storage. So not only will the drug benefit from patients preferring pills to injections, but it's also easier to manufacture, ship, and scale. While pricing pressure from pharmacy benefit managers is a risk, Lilly's pipeline, strong GLP-1 portfolio, and manufacturing scale position it well for continued strong growth. e.l.f. Beauty(ELF-2.65%)is entering a new phase of growth following its $1 billionacquisition of Rhode, the skincare and cosmetics brand launched by Hailey Bieber. The deal gives e.l.f. a fast-growing, premium-priced brand that generated $212 million in sales over the past year despite Rhode only selling around 10 products through its website and having limited paid marketing. The acquisition is well timed, as e.l.f.'s growth cooled in fiscal Q4, with sales up just 4% year over year after surging 40% through the first nine months of the year. Meanwhile, with the majority of its products made in China, it also faces tariff pressures. That said, the Rhode acquisition should be a powerful growth engine for the company moving forward. With a limited product assortment and distribution, e.l.f. will have a huge opportunity to expand both. Rhode was already set to begin selling its products at Sephora later this year, while e.l.f. has strong relationships with retailersUlta BeautyandTarget. One of the best times to buy a consumer brand is when it's about to increase its distribution, so this is a great opportunity to buy e.l.f. shares.",

        "header": "Should You Buy Micron Technology Stock Before June 25?",
        "content": "The semiconductor industry is the beating heart of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, because most development happens in large data centers that are filled with thousands of graphics processing units (GPUs) from chipmakers likeNvidia(NVDA0.87%)andAdvanced Micro Devices(AMD-0.20%). Micron Technology(MU1.22%)is another leading chip company, but it doesn't supply GPUs, so it receives less attention than the likes of Nvidia. Instead, Micron makes memory and storage chips, which are becoming extremely important for processing AI workloads, not only in data centers, but also in computers and smartphones. Micron is scheduled to release its financial results for its fiscal 2025 third quarter (which ended on May 30) on June 25, and the company's guidance suggests the report could reveal substantial growth at the top and bottom line, driven by AI. Should investors buy the stock ahead of the release? Image source: Getty Images. GPUs are ideal forAI workloadsbecause they are designed for parallel processing, meaning they can handle multiple tasks at once with a high degree of efficiency. ButGPUsneed memory to store data in a ready state, so it can be called upon at a moment's notice to speed up processing time. Micron's HBM3E (high-bandwidth memory) for the data center is the best in the industry. In fact, Nvidia selected it to power its latest Blackwell and Blackwell Ultra GPUs, which aredesigned for next-generation \"reasoning\" AI models. These models require significantly more computing power and memory than traditionallarge language models(LLMs), because they spend more time thinking in the background to craft the most accurate responses for users. Micron expects the market for data center HBM to double to $35 billion this year, and then grow to $100 billion by 2030. The company is already completely sold out of HBM3E until 2026, and it's now working on HBM4E to stay ahead of the competition. This new solution will launch next year, and it could deliver a whopping 60% more bandwidth than its predecessor. But memory is also a critical component in computers and smartphones -- even more so now that some smaller AI workloads are designed to be processed on-device. In other words, chips are becoming powerful enough to run some AI applications (like chatbots) offline, so they don't need to lean on any computing power from external data centers. As a result, Micron says the minimum DRAM (memory) requirement in an AI personal computer is now 16 gigabytes, up from 12 gigabytes last year for non-AI computers. AI-enabled smartphones have also experienced a jump in memory demand to 12 gigabytes, compared to 8 gigabytes for their non-AI counterparts. During the fiscal 2025 second quarter (ended Feb. 27), Micron generated $8.1 billion in totalrevenue, which was a 38% increase from the year-ago period. That included $4.6 billion in compute and networking revenue -- where the company accounts for its data center memory sales -- which was up by a whopping 109%. Micron likely had another very strong three-month stretch in the third quarter of fiscal 2025, the results of which will be announced on June 25. The company forecast around $8.8 billion in revenue, which would be a 29% increase from the year-ago quarter. Management didn't offer any specific guidance for the compute and networking segment, but it has been the main driver of Micron's consistent strength over the past year, and that was likely the case again in Q3. Micron's surging revenue is also driving strong growth at its bottom line. The company delivered $1.56 innon-GAAP(generally accepted accounting principles)earnings per share(EPS) during the second quarter, a 271% increase from the year-ago period. Management's guidance suggests non-GAAP EPS came in at around $1.37 in Q3, which would be up 121% year over year. Based on Micron's $5.15 in trailing-12-month EPS, its stock is trading at aprice-to-earnings (P/E) ratioof just 23.3. That makes it much cheaper than Nvidia stock, which trades at a P/E ratio of 45.7. Since Micron's HBM3E is embedded intoNvidia's most powerful GPUs, investors who believe Nvidia's AI chip sales will continue to soar should also hold a positive view of Micron's business from here. Back in March, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said his company already had orders for 3.6 million Blackwell GPUs from just four customers alone, which suggests Micron's data center business could boom for the foreseeable future. Therefore, Micron's success won't hinge on any single quarter. I think the stock could be a great buy right now based on its valuation and the demand pipeline for its memory chips, irrespective of the upcoming June 25 report. As long as investors are willing to hold the stock for the long term, they give themselves a good chance to earn a positive return.",

The company has been at the forefront of artificial intelligence for at least a decade, acquiring the AI research lab DeepMind in 2014, and launching Google Brain, which merged with DeepMind in 2023, before that. The company has made AI a stated priority for at least eight years, and it's kept pace with advances in generative AI with Google Gemini, its AI model, and its AI assistant that is readily available on Google Search. In addition to the company's prowess in AI technology, the stock's valuation is also attractive at a price-to-earnings ratio of just 20, meaning it trades at more than a 20% discount to theS&P 500. Investors seem to be wary of the stock because of pressure on the regulatory front and concerns that generative AI chatbots pose a threat to the dominance of Google Search. The regulatory concerns might seem valid after the company was found in court to have a monopoly in both search and ad tech, and the company is now awaiting a decision on \"remedies\" for the search business, while its remedies trial for ad tech is set for September. Alphabet could receive a fine or be forced to divest part of its business, but at the current valuation, any risk looks sufficiently priced in. It's true that AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Perplexity pose a threat to Google Search, but thus far, Google has held its own, continuing to grow. In fact, growth in the business has been steady, and Google Cloud has also turned profitable. Overall, its competitive advantages remain intact, and its valuation is attractive. It looks like a classic Buffett stock set to deliver growth over the long term. Another wide-moat AI stock worth taking a look at isTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(TSM-0.17%), or TSMC for short. TSMC is the world's largest manufacturer of semiconductors. It's a contract chip maker and handles production for companies includingApple,Nvidia,AMD, andBroadcom. It handles more than half of the third-party chip production in the world and roughly 90% of advanced chip production, making it a key player in AI, as cutting-edge chip designers like Nvidia rely on TSMC's infrastructure and expertise to make its chips. Given the company's market share, there's no close second in third-party chip manufacturing, and leading integrated device manufacturers such asSamsungandIntelhave struggled of late. TSMC has also been a major beneficiary of the AI boom, as both revenue and profit have soared lately. In the first quarter, TSMC's revenue jumped 35.3% year over year to $25.5 billion, and net income rose 60% to $10.9 billion. TSMC's operating margin was 48.5% in the quarter, a clear sign of its pricing power and competitive advantage. Even with that growth rate, its profitability, and its competitive advantages, TSMC stock trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of just 25.6, in line with the S&P 500. Some consider TSMC risky because it's headquartered in Taiwan, a disputed territory, and some investors are wary of a Chinese invasion. While anything is possible in geopolitics, there are no imminent signs of an invasion, and TSMC has diversified away from Taiwan, opening plants in the U.S., Europe, and Japan, meaning those fears may be overblown. Based on its technological strength, growth rate, attractive valuation, and the tailwinds from AI, TSMC looks well-positioned for long-term growth.",

        "content": "So you'relooking for dividend income-- good for you! Dividend income can be a lifesaver in retirement and can provide cash for more investing when you haven't yet retired. You might also be wishing you were anNvidia(NVDA0.87%)shareholder -- because, let's face it, who wouldn't want to be? The semiconductor company has been on a tear in recent years,growing like gangbustersand averaging annual gains of 75% over the past five years and 51% over the past 15 years. Image source: Getty Images. If you're thinking maybe you can combine your quest for dividend income and for Nvidia shares, you might want to think again, though -- because while Nvidiadoespay a dividend, it isn't a very big one. It's currently a penny per share per quarter, totaling $0.04 per share over the course of a year. So if you're looking for, say, $500 in annual dividend income, you'd need alotof Nvidia shares. Divide $500 by $0.04, and you'll get 12,500 -- which is the number of shares you'd need to own to generate $500 per year in dividends. Here's the catch -- with shares recently at $142 apiece, buying 12,500 shares would cost you nearly $1.8 million. That could certainly bea terrific investment, but it's not the most efficient way to produce annual income of $500. So look elsewhere forgreat dividend investments, but do considerinvesting in Nvidia. It used to be known as a maker of gaming-chipsemiconductors, but it's nowa titan in the world of data center chips(often used forartificial intelligence(AI) operations and even cryptocurrency mining). It may grow via acquisitions, too. Better still, Nvidia's stock seems reasonably valued at recent levels. Its recentforward-looking price-to-earnings (P/E) ratioof 34, for example, is below its five-year average of 40. And its recentprice-to-sales ratioof 24 is close to its five-year average, though that's quite a steep level.",

        "header": "3 Best Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Buy in June",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) stocks have been the must-own stocks over the past few years, but we're still a long way away from full AI deployment, so many AI stocks are still worth buying, even at their current levels. At the top of my shopping list areNvidia(NVDA0.87%),Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(TSM-0.17%), andMeta Platforms(META-0.29%). These three each tackle AI in their own way and could be excellent long-term investments. Image source: Getty Images. Nvidia makes graphics processing units (GPUs), which are widely deployed to train and run AI workloads. Its market share dominance in this industry is impressive, with most estimates pegging it at around 90%. Due to unprecedented AI demand, the GPU market has grown massively, and Nvidia's growth has been nothing short of jaw-dropping. Nvidia put up impressive growth figures over the past few years, and although the growth rate is \"slowing,\" it's hard to say that seriously when Nvidia grew revenue 69% year over year to $44 billion in Q1. It also projects it to grow by 50% in Q2, underscoring its strength. As long as there's huge AI demand, Nvidia will be a successful investment. Even with shares trading at 33 times forward earnings, it's about in line with other big tech stocks. However, Nvidia's growth and potential are far greater than many of its big tech peers, which makes it a solid stock to scoop up in June. Taiwan Semiconductor is a huge beneficiary of the massive demand that Nvidia experienced. Nvidia doesn't have the ability to produce its own chips, so it outsources that work to Taiwan Semiconductor. Nvidia isn't the only company that does this; nearly every big tech company that makes hardware uses chips from Taiwan Semiconductor's factories. This allows Taiwan Semi to stay neutral in the AI arms race, while benefiting from the massive spending. Investing in TSMC isn't picking a winner in the AI arms race; it's a bet that there will be increased AI spending in the future. That seems like a surefire take, so the stock will stay at the top of my buy list for the foreseeable future. Another reason I'm a Taiwan Semi bull is its stock price. Despite benefiting from multiple tailwinds, its stock hasn't achieved a premium valuation. It trades at 22.9 times forward earnings -- the same as the broader market, as measured by theS&P 500. With big growth ahead for Taiwan Semi and a cheap starting price, it's a no-brainer AI stock to scoop up in June. Meta Platforms is likely better known by its former name: Facebook. Meta's social media platforms (like Facebook, Instagram, Threads, WhatsApp, and Messenger) are the business's cash cow, with 98% of revenue coming from advertising on these platforms. However, Meta is also massively investing in AI. Part of the focus with AI is improving the advertising on these platforms, which will boost existing revenue and profits. It's also developing AI capabilities internally to supplement its engineering team with AI agents, which will help save on operating expenses. However, Meta's most aspirational investments involve its AI glasses and other gadgets that will bring AI into the real world rather than just behind a computer screen. CEO and founder Mark Zuckerberg believes that AI glasses are the ideal form factor for deploying AI to the real world and that they will see widespread use in the next five to 10 years. While the verdict remains to be reached on these developments, Meta's stock only trades on its legacy ad business. At 27 times forward earnings, the market hasn't priced in any upside from one of Meta's ancillary bets paying off.  META PE Ratio (Forward)data byYCharts That's a fair price to buy for Meta's legacy business, but if one of its other investments works out, Meta's stock could turn into a massive winner in short order. As a result,it's one of my top AI picks for June.",

        "content": "No company has capitalized on the AI revolution more dramatically than Nvidia. Its revenue, profitability, and cash reserves have skyrocketed since the introduction of ChatGPT over two years ago \u2014 and the many competitive generative AI services that have launched since. And its stock price soared. During that period, the world\u2019s leading high-performance GPU maker has used its ballooning fortunes to significantly increase investments in all sorts of startups but particularly in AI startups. The chip giant ramped up its venture capital activity in 2024, participating in 49 funding rounds for AI companies, a sharp increase from 34 in 2023, according to PitchBook data. It\u2019s a dramatic surge in investment compared to the previous four years combined, during which Nvidia funded only 38 AI deals. Note that these investments exclude those made by its formal corporate VC fund, NVentures, which also significantly ramped up its investing in the last two years. (PitchBook says NVentures engaged in 24 deals in 2024, compared to just 2 in 2022.) In 2025, Nvidia has already participated in seven rounds. Nvidiahas statedthat the goal of its corporate investing is to expand the AI ecosystem by backing startups it considers to be \u201cgame changers and market makers.\u201d Below is a list of startups that raised rounds exceeding $100 million where Nvidia is a named participant since 2023, including new ones it has backed so far in 2025, organized from the highest amount to lowest raised in the round. OpenAI:Nvidia backed the ChatGPT maker for the first time in October, reportedly writing a$100 million checktoward a colossal $6.6 billion round that valued the company at $157 billion. The chipmaker\u2019s investment was dwarfed by OpenAI\u2019s other backers, notably Thrive, which according to the New York Times invested $1.3 billion. xAI:Nvidia participated in the $6 billion round of Elon Musk\u2019s xAI. The deal revealed that not all of OpenAI\u2019s investorsfollowed its requestto refrain from backing any of its direct competitors. After investing in the ChatGPT maker in October, Nvidia joined xAI\u2019s cap tablea few months later. Inflection:One of Nvidia\u2019s first significant AI investments also had one of the most unusual outcomes. In June 2023, Nvidia was one of several lead investors in Inflection\u2019s$1.3 billionround, a company founded by Mustafa Suleyman, who earlier founded DeepMind. Less than a year later, Microsoft hired Inflection AI\u2019s founders,paying $620 millionfor a non-exclusive technology license, leaving the company with a significantly diminished workforce and a less defined future. Wayve:In May, Nvidia participated in a$1.05 billion roundfor the U.K.-based startup, which is developing a self-learning system for autonomous driving. The company is testing its vehicles in the U.K. and the San Francisco Bay Area. Scale AI:In May 2024, Nvidia joined Accel and other tech giants Amazon and Meta to invest$1 billionin Scale AI, which provides data-labeling services to companies for training AI models. The round valued the San Francisco-based company at nearly $14 billion. Crusoe:A startup building data centersreportedlyto be leased to Oracle, Microsoft, and OpenAIraised $686 millionin late November, according to an SEC filing. The investment was led by Founders Fund, and the long list of other investors included Nvidia. Figure AI:In February 2024, AI robotics startup Figure raiseda $675 millionSeries B from Nvidia, OpenAI Startup Fund, Microsoft, and others. The round valued the company at $2.6 billion. Mistral AI:Nvidia invested in Mistral for the second time when the French-based large language model developer raised a $640 million Series B at a$6 billion valuationin June. Lambda:AI cloud provider Lambda, which provides services for model training, raised a$480 million Series Dat a reported$2.5 billion valuationin February. The round was co-led by SGW and Andra Capital Lambda, and joined by Nvidia, ARK Invest, and others. A significant part of Lambda\u2019s business involves renting servers powered by Nvidia\u2019s GPUs. Cohere:In June, Nvidia invested in Cohere\u2019s$500 million round, a large language model provider serving enterprises. The chipmaker first backed the Toronto-based startup in 2023. Perplexity:Nvidia first invested in Perplexity in November of 2023 and has participated in every subsequent round of the AI search engine startup, including the$500 millionround in December, which values the company at $9 billion, according to PitchBook data. Poolside:In October, the AI coding assistant startup Poolside announced it raised$500 millionled by Bain Capital Ventures. Nvidia participated in the round, which valued the AI startup at $3 billion. CoreWeave:Nvidia invested in the AI cloud computing provider in April 2023, when CoreWeave raised$221 millionin funding. Since then, CoreWeave\u2019s valuation has jumped from about $2 billion to$19 billion, and the company hasfiled for an IPO. CoreWeave allows its customers to rent Nvidia GPUs on an hourly basis. Together AI:In February, Nvidia participated in the$305 million Series Bof this company, which offers cloud-based infrastructure for building AI models. The round valued Together AI at $3.3 billion and was co-led by Prosperity7, a Saudi Arabian venture firm, and General Catalyst. Nvidia backed the companyfor the first timein 2023. Sakana AI:In September, Nvidia invested in the Japan-based startup, which trains low-cost generative AI models using small datasets. The startup raised a massiveSeries A round of about $214 millionat a valuation of $1.5 billion. Imbue:The AI research lab that claims to be developing AI systems that can reason and code raised a$200 million roundin September 2023 from investors, including Nvidia, Astera Institute, and former Cruise CEO Kyle Vogt. Waabi:In June, the autonomous trucking startup raised a$200 million Series Bround co-led by existing investors Uber and Khosla Ventures. Other investors included Nvidia, Volvo Group Venture Capital, and Porsche Automobil Holding SE. Ayar Labs:In December, Nvidia invested in the$155 million roundof Ayar Labs, a company developing optical interconnects to improve AI compute and power efficiency. This was the third time Nvidia backed the startup. Kore.ai: The startup developing enterprise-focused AI chatbots raised$150 millionin December of 2023. In addition to Nvidia, investors participating in the funding included FTV Capital, Vistara Growth, and Sweetwater Private Equity. Sandbox AQ:In April, Nvidia, alongside Google, BNP Paribas and others, invested$150 millionin Sandbox AQ, a startup developing large quantitative models (LQMs) for handling complex numerical analysis and statistical calculations. The investment increased Sandbox AQ\u2019s Series E round to $450 million and the company\u2019s valuation to $5.75 billion. Hippocratic AI:This startup, which is developing large language models for healthcare, announced in January that it raised a$141 million Series Bat a valuation of $1.64 billion led by Kleiner Perkins. Nvidia participated in the round, along with returning investors Andreessen Horowitz, General Catalyst, and others. The company claims that its AI solutions can handle non-diagnostic patient-facing tasks such as pre-operating procedures, remote patient monitoring, and appointment preparation. Weka:In May, Nvidia invested in a$140 millionround for AI-native data management platform Weka. The round valued the Silicon Valley company at $1.6 billion. Runway:In June of 2023, Runway, a startup building generative AI tools for multimedia content creators, raised a$141 million Series Cextension from investors, including Nvidia, Google, and Salesforce. Bright Machines:In June 2024, Nvidia participated in a$126 million Series Cof Bright Machines, a smart robotics and AI-driven software startup. Enfabrica:In September 2023, Nvidia invested in networking chips designer Enfabrica\u2019s$125 million Series B. Although the startup raised another $115 million in November, Nvidia didn\u2019t participate in the round. Editor\u2019s note: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that Nvidia is a backer of Safe Superintelligence and an investor in Vast Data\u2019s Series E round. Nvidia hasn\u2019t invested in Vast Data since the company\u2019s Series D.",

CNBC reports AWS will soon launch a Graviton4 update boasting 600 Gbps of network bandwidth, courtesy of its Annapurna Labs design, with availability expected by month's end. Later this year, AWS plans to roll out Trainium3, promising 50% better energy efficiency versus Trainium2, which underpins Anthropic's Claude Opus 4 model. While Nvidia's Blackwell GPU retains a rawperformance lead, Trainium2 already offers superior cost-performance ratios, according to AWS Senior Director Gadi Hutt. Developers eyeing Trainium will need to retool workloads away from Nvidia's CUDA ecosystem and validate modelaccuracy parity on AWS's frameworks. Nvidia has dominated AI compute thanks to unmatched throughput and the ubiquity of CUDA in developer toolchains. By delivering strong price-performance and energy gains via Graviton4 and Trainium3, AWS aims to lure hyperscalers and cost-sensitive enterprises that run massive inference fleets or large-scale training jobs. If AWS can minimize migration friction and prove equivalent accuracy, it could open the door for a meaningful shift in AI infrastructure spend. The real test will come when Graviton4 benchmarks are published and Trainium3 previews hit developer hands. Watch for cloudnative AI workloads running on non-CUDA stacks and for enterprise case studies highlighting total cost-of-ownership savings.

The updated forecast reflects a potential 38% gain from Nvidia's June 16 closing price of $144.69. Barclays cited fresh supply chain checks that suggest about $2 billion in revenue upside for July, prompting the firm to boost its full-year Compute revenue estimate to $37 billion from $35.6 billion. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. Although Blackwell chip production reached only 30,000 wafers per month in June, below the bank's earlier 40,000-wafer estimate, utilization rates remain solid. Barclays also highlighted continued progress on Blackwell Ultra, which is expected to enter mass production in the third quarter. System sales are picking up, projected to make up 25% of revenue in July and rising to nearly half by October. The analysts said higher volumes and the Ultra rollout should lift gross margins in the second half. Compute revenue projections were revised up for Q3 and Q4, to $42 billion and $48 billion, respectively.

        "content": "Over the last several months, a new pocket of the AI realm called quantum computing has started to garner quite a bit of attention from the investment community. What's unique, however, is that the usual suspects ofNvidia,Microsoft,Alphabet, andAmazonaren't really pegged to the rising interest in quantum computing technology. Rather, a new cohort of rising stars such asRigetti Computing,D-Wave Quantum, andIonQ(IONQ4.15%)are among the most popular quantum computing stocks right now. With shares down by 25% from their peak over the last year, IonQ stock trades for roughly $40 as of this writing. Is now a good opportunity to pounce on the stock? Quantum computing is not a widely used application in artificial intelligence (AI) today. Yet despite its developmental stage, global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company is forecasting thatquantum computing could be a $131 billion opportunityin the coming decades. With the potential for such enormous upside, it's not entirely surprising that investors were quick to look at which companies are involved with quantum computing development. One reason that I think IonQ has emerged as a favorite in the quantum computing market is the company's impressivepartnerships with cloud hyperscalersMicrosoft, Amazon, and Alphabet. With the stock sliding as of late, investors may be wondering if the sell-off is an opportunity to buy the dip. Image source: Getty Images. Despite working with major AI developers, IonQ has little to show in terms of tangible growth. Over the last year, the company has only generated $43 million in revenue. Meanwhile, the company's net losses are in the hundreds of millions (and worsening).  IONQ Revenue (TTM)data byYCharts In a way, this financial profile actually makes some sense. As I alluded to above, quantum computing is not yet commercially used in AI development. Given those dynamics, IonQ's revenue potential is fairly limited for the time being. The unfortunate reality is that the company will likely remain a high-cash-burn operation as it continues building out its platform. But still, for just $40 could IonQ be worth a look? Well, smart investors understand that the stock price alone does not determine the worth of a business. As of this writing, IonQ boasts a market capitalization of nearly $10 billion. This implies that IonQ is trading for aprice-to-sales(P/S) ratio of 195. IonQ's P/S ratio is not just high; it is multiples above what investors witnessed during the peak euphoria of the dotcom bubble in the late 1990s. I bring this up because the prospects of quantum computing and the appearance of a low share price might tempt investors into chasingmomentum-- mistakenly thinking they are buying a stock for a \"cheap\" price. The reality is that IonQ stock is anything but cheap. Given the mounting losses pictured above, I suspect that IonQ could have a tough time financing future projects -- further limiting its ability to monetize and grow. In my eyes, the current sell-off in IonQ stockcould lead to further plummetingin the shares. I would not be surprised if IonQ begins to witness a significant valuation correction as more growth investors come to understand that they have been investing in a narrative around the company as opposed to an actual, concrete long-term thesis. For these reasons, I would stay away from IonQ right now. Even with a 25% drop in share price, the valuation analysis explored above suggests the stock is still overbought and not yet trading for a reasonable price.",

The company expects these requirements to result in an $8 billion hit to Nvidia\u2019s revenue in Q2. May 28 \u2013AMD kicks off its acquisition spree. The semiconductor companyannounced that it acquired Enosemi, a silicon photonics startup. Enosemi\u2019s tech, which uses light photons to transmit data, is becoming an increasing area of interest for semiconductor companies. May 21 \u2013China\u2019s Commerce Secretary didn\u2019t like the U.S.\u2019s guidance, issued on May 13, that warned U.S. companies that using Huawei\u2019s AI chips \u201canywhere in the world\u201d was a U.S. chip export violation. The commerce secretaryissued a statement that threatened legal actionagainst anyone caught enforcing that export restriction. May 20 \u2013Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan seemingly got right to work on his plan to spin out Intel\u2019s non-core business units. The semiconductor giant is reportedly looking tooffload its networking and edge units, which makes chips for telecom equipment, and was responsible for $5.4 billion of the company\u2019s 2024 revenue. May 13 \u2013Just days before the Biden administration\u2019s Artificial Intelligence Diffusion Rule was set to go into place, theU.S. Department of Commerce formally rescinded it. The DOC said that it plans to issue new guidance in the future, and in the meantime companies should remember that using Huawei\u2019s Ascend AI chips anywhere in the world is a violation of U.S. export rules. May 7: Just a week before the \u201cFramework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion\u201d was set to go into place, the Trump administration plans on taking a different path. According to multiple media outlets, includingAxiosandBloomberg, the administration won\u2019t enforce the restrictions when they were supposed to start on May 15 and is instead working on its own framework. April 30:Anthropicdoubled down on its supportfor restricting U.S.-made chip exports, including some tweaks to the Framework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion, like imposing further restrictions on Tier 2 countries and dedicating resources to enforcement.An Nvidia spokesperson shot back, saying, \u201cAmerican firms should focus on innovation and rise to the challenge, rather than tell tall tales that large, heavy, and sensitive electronics are somehow smuggled in \u2018baby bumps\u2019 or \u2018alongside live lobsters.'\u201d April 22:Ahead of its Q1 earnings call, Intel said it was planning to lay off more than21,000 employees. The layoffs were meant to streamline management, something CEO Lip-Bu Tan has long said Intel needed to do, and help rebuild the company\u2019s engineering focus. April 15:Nvidia\u2019s H20 AI chip got hit with an exportlicensing requirement, the company disclosed in an SEC filing. The company added it expects $5.5 billion in charges related to this new requirement in the first quarter of its 2026 fiscal year. The H20 is the most advanced AI chip Nvidia can still export to China in some form or fashion. TSMC and Intel reported similar expenses the same week. April 9:Nvidia\u2019s CEOJensen Huang was spotted attending dinner at Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lagoresort, according to reports. At the time,NPR reportedHuang may have been able to spare Nvidia\u2019s H20 AI chips from export restrictions upon agreeing to invest in AI data centers in the U.S. April 3:Intel and TSMCallegedly reached a tentative agreementto launch a joint chipmaking venture. This joint venture would operate Intel\u2019s chipmaking facilities, and TSMC would have a 20% stake in the new venture. Both companies declined to comment or confirm. If this deal doesn\u2019t come to fruition, this is likely a decent preview of potential deals in this industry to come. April 1:CEO Lip-Bu Tan got to work right away. Just weeks after he joined Intel, the company announced that it was going tospin off noncore assetsso it could focus. He also said the company would launch new products, including custom semiconductors for customers. March 12:Intel announced that industry veteran, and former board member,Lip-Bu Tan would return to the company as CEOon March 18. At the time of his appointment, Tan said Intel would be an \u201cengineering-focused company\u201d under his leadership. February 28:Intel was supposed to start operating its first chip fabrication plant in Ohio this year. Instead,the company slowed down constructionon the plant for the second time in February. Now the $28 billion semiconductor project won\u2019t wrap up construction until 2030 and may not even open until 2031. February 3:U.S. senators, including Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass) and Josh Hawley (R-Mo), wrote a letter to Commerce Secretary Nominee-Designate Howard Lutnickurging the Trump administration to further restrictAI chip exports. The letter specifically referred to Nvidia\u2019s H20 AI chips, which were used in the training of DeepSeek\u2019s R1 \u201creasoning\u201d model. January 27:Chinese AI startupDeepSeekcaused quite the stir in Silicon Valley when it released theopen version of its R1 \u201creasoning\u201d model. While this isn\u2019t semiconductor news specifically, the sheer alarm in the AI and semiconductor industries DeepSeek\u2019s release caused continues to have ripple effects on the chip industry. January 13:With just a week left in office, former president Joe Bidenproposed sweeping new export restrictionson U.S.-made AI chips. This order created a three-tier structure that determined how many U.S. chips can be exported to each country. Under this proposal, Tier 1 countries faced no restrictions; Tier 2 countries had a chip purchase limit for the first time; and Tier 3 countries got additional restrictions. January 6:\u00a0Anthropic co-founder and CEO Dario Amodei co-wrote an op-ed inThe Wall Street Journalendorsing existing AI chip export controls and pointing to them as a reason why China\u2019s AI market was behind the U.S.\u2019. He also called on incoming president Donald Trump to impose further restrictions and to close loopholes that have allowed AI companies in China to still get their hands on these chips.",

        "content": "Artificial intelligence(AI) is the defining technological innovation of our era. In just a few short years, AI is expected to reshape every corner of society. Semi-autonomous robots may soon handle your laundry, then hop in a self-driving car to pick up groceries. Life is about to get radically different -- ideally, for the better. At the center of this so-called Fourth Industrial Revolution isNvidia(NVDA0.87%), the leading supplier of AI chips powering everything from data centers to robotics. Thanks to its central position within the AI value chain, Nvidia's stock has delivered a remarkable 829% return over the past 36 months, turning a $10,000 investment into $92,880. Image source: Getty Images. As incredible as that sounds,Palantir Technologies(PLTR1.22%)has done even better. Over the same 36-month period, Palantir has returned an astonishing 1,744%, transforming that same $10,000 investment into $184,370, nearly double Nvidia's impressive gains. Both companies are riding the same tidal wave -- but in different lanes. Nvidia builds the computational engine, while Palantir delivers the software layer that interprets the data and enables real-world decisions. Which of these top innovation stocks is the better buy as a core AI holding? Nvidia's Q1 fiscal 2026 results (ended April 27, 2025) showcased both massive scale and new headwinds. Revenue hit $44.1 billion, up 69% year over year, with data center revenue specifically climbing 73% to $39.1 billion. Still, the China situation is deteriorating rapidly. Nvidia lost $2.5 billion in H20 revenue in Q1 and expects to lose $8 billion in Q2 from new export licensing requirements. CEO Jensen Huang lamented that \"the $50 billion China market is effectively closed to us,\" with market share in the country falling from 95% to 50% under these restrictions. Palantir, meanwhile, is hitting \"escape velocity.\" Q1 2025 revenue of $884 million grew 39% year over year, accelerating from previous quarters. U.S. revenue surged 55% to $628 million, with U.S. commercial revenue exploding 71% to $255 million, surpassing a $1 billion annual run rate for the first time in company history. Palantir also raised full-year 2025 guidance to $3.89 to $3.9 billion, representing projected annual growth of about 36% year over year. The global AI market is projected to surpass $826 billion by 2030, even on conservative estimates. Within this vast opportunity, Nvidia and Palantir Technologies occupy distinct positions along the AI value chain. Nvidia leads the infrastructure layer, powering the compute backbone of AI. CEO Jensen Huang projects annual data center spending could exceed $1 trillion by 2028. The company is evolving from a chipmaker into a builder of AI factories, with new partnerships to construct AI supercomputers across the U.S., Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Taiwan. Its Blackwell Ultra architecture and DGX SuperPOD systems place Nvidia at the forefront of \"agentic AI reasoning\" -- a key step toward the emergence of autonomous, intelligent systems. Palantir, by contrast, operates in the application layer, helping enterprises deploy AI across real-world use cases. CEO Alex Karp described the company as being \"in the middle of a tectonic shift,\" as demand for large language models has \"turned into a stampede.\" Unlike many AI companies focused on research or infrastructure, Palantir is already monetizing AI through government contracts and commercial deployments, giving it a practical foothold in the race to bring AI into everyday operations. Despite commanding massive revenue and leading the AI infrastructure space, Nvidia trades at 46 times trailing earnings, well below its five-year averageprice-to-earningsratio (P/E) of 78. Its forward P/E of 30 suggests the market is accounting for China-related export risks and a natural deceleration in growth from its enormous base. Palantir, by contrast, trades at valuation levels that challenge traditional metrics. The stock has a trailing P/E exceeding 600 and a forward ratio exceeding 230. These elevated multiples reflect investor belief that Palantir is at a key inflection point. The market appears to be betting on the company's ability to sustain hypergrowth while expanding its margins, a high bar that leaves little room for missteps.  PLTR P/E Ratiodata byYCharts. Palantir stock has been a phenomenal performer, but at 600 times earnings, perfection is already priced in. Any execution slip or slowdown in growth could prompt a sharp repricing. While its $3.9 billion revenue run rate is expanding rapidly, it remains relatively small, compared to the multitrillion-dollar AI market. Nvidia offers a more compelling risk-reward profile. At 46 times earnings, roughly 40% below its recent historical average, the stock combines reasonable valuation with several powerful growth catalysts. The Blackwell product cycle is just beginning, and robotics -- a largely overlooked segment -- could become a significant driver over the next decade. Palantir remains a compelling long-term growth story, but its current valuation demands flawless near-term execution. In this match-up, Nvidia stands out as the stronger core AI investment.",

        "header": "Where Will AMD Stock Be in 5 Years?",
        "content": "The past year has been underwhelming forAdvanced Micro Devices(AMD-0.20%)investors as shares of the chipmaker have dropped more than 20% during this period, but the recent stock price action suggests that a turnaround is on the way. AMD stock hit a 52-week low on April 8. It has jumped an impressive 61% since then. But will this semiconductor giant be able to sustain its momentum in the long run and deliver solid gains to investors over the next five years? Image source: Getty Images. AMD's recent quarterly reports make it clear that the chipmaker's business is moving in the right direction. Its revenue in the first quarter of 2025 increased an impressive 36% year over year, while its guidance for the current quarter points toward another nice year-over-year increase of 27%. The chipamker's data center and client processor businesses are driving the bulk of this growth. The company's data centergraphics processing units (GPUs)and central processing units (CPUs) are in healthy demand from cloud computing customers who are deploying them in artificial intelligence (AI) servers for model training and inference. This explains the 57% year-over-year increase in AMD's data center revenue in Q1. Importantly, AMD sees a massive increase in its addressable opportunity in the data center segment over the next few years. At its recently held Advancing AI investor event, AMD pointed out that the data center AI accelerator market is on track to clock an annual growth rate of more than 60% through 2028, generating more than $500 billion in revenue by 2028. There is no doubt thatNvidiais the dominant company in this market with a share of 92%, but AMD is trying to catch up thanks to its product development moves. The chipmaker has just unveiled its MI350 series of data center GPUs, claiming that it packs 4 times more computing power than the previous generation offering, apart from achieving a 35-fold increase in AI inferencing. Analysts estimate that the new MI350 family of processors will help AMD close the gap with Nvidia's Blackwell offerings. Moreover, AMD's future product roadmap should allow it to keep pace with Nvidia as the former is forecasting a tenfold jump in performance with its MI400 series of processors that are scheduled for launch next year. So don't be surprised to see the adoption of AMD's data center GPUs increasing in the future thanks to the updated and more capable AI chips that they bring to the market. As a result, there is a good chance of AMD's data center GPU market share increasing from last year's level of 4%. If the company can carve out a share of even 10% of this market by 2030, its data center GPU revenue alone could increase to $50 billion (based on the company's AI chip revenue forecast mentioned above). That would be an increase of over 10x from the $5 billion in data center GPU revenue that AMD generated last year. Given that analysts are expecting AMD to end 2025 with just under $32 billion in revenue, the data center GPU business can alone turn out to be a terrific growth driver for the company over the next five years. This, however, is not the only catalyst that has the ability to supercharge AMD's growth over the next five years. The next generation of gaming consoles fromSonyandMicrosoft, which are expected to hit the market in 2027 and 2028, are likely to give AMD's business a nice lift over the next five years. AMD has reportedly landed the $30 billion contract to manufacture the chip for powering Sony's upcoming PlayStation 6 console. Microsoft's next-generation Xbox console is also expected to be powered by AMD hardware. As such, the company seems on track to capitalize on multiple multibillion-dollar markets through 2030. According to Yahoo! Finance, AMD has a price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG ratio) of just 0.69 based on the potential annual earnings growth it could deliver over the next five years. The PEG ratio is a forward-looking valuation metric that's calculated by dividing a company's trailing earnings multiple by its projected annual earnings growth. A reading of less than 1 means that a stock is undervalued when you take into account the potential growth it could deliver. AMD's reading shows that it is quite undervalued based on the growth that it could clock in the future. The following chart indicates that the company's bottom-line growth is expected to remain solid in 2026 and 2027.  AMD EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Yeardata byYCharts Assuming the company can clock an earnings growth rate of even 15% in the three years after 2027, its earnings could jump to $10.57 per share by the end of the decade (using 2027's forecast earnings of $6.95 per share as the base). AMD has a five-year average forward earnings multiple of 31. But even if it trades at a discounted 25 times earnings after five years and hits the estimated earnings per share calculated above, its stock price could jump to $264. That would be a 112% jump from current levels. So, investors looking to buy anAI stockthat could deliver healthy gains over the next five years can consider buying AMD given its solid prospects.",

There are 64 more trading days left between now and expiration, IV is at 107%, 8-9% short position relative to float. Currently nvda holds a 7% stake in coreweave and a strategic partnership, which was partially responsible for the run up. Below is a summary of the partnership from nvda:  \u201cThe general availability of NVIDIA GB200 NVL72-based instances on CoreWeave underscores the latest in the companies\u2019 collaboration, focused on delivering the latest accelerated computing solutions to the cloud. With the launch of these instances, enterprises now have access to the scale and performance needed to power the next wave of AI reasoning models and agents.  Customers can start provisioning GB200 NVL72-based instances through CoreWeave Kubernetes Service in the US-WEST-01 region using the gb200-4x instance ID. To get started, contact CoreWeave.\u201d  Coreweave owns data centers in the US and Canada including the fastest super computer in the world that is powered by nvda chips. The strategic partnership (as well as ownership stake) gives coreweave dibs on the latest nvda chips, which gives coreweave a leg up over its competitors. In addition to Nvda, Microsoft is another major client. It is my opinion that we are just at the beginning of an AI arms race, coreweave is in a fantastic position to reap  the benefits from money from both private and public sectors indiscriminately flowing into anything related to AI.   Biggest concerns include 1) 325% 3 months run making coreweave susceptible to major pull back, and 2) geopolitical tensions and tariff wars may tank the market.   However, the concerns are short term, and are alleviated by the large premium (my break even is $87.94), the stock would need to drop almost 50% from Wednesday close for me to incur a loss. Worst case scenario, I am forced to buy 3,100 shares at a loss, I will sell covered calls and wheel my way to profitability.   Best case scenario is that coreweave closes in the $150 range with high IV on 9/19 and I get to run it back again, while collecting more premium and interest.",

        "header": "Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller Made a Huge Mistake With Nvidia",
        "content": "Stanley Druckenmiller has shown he's a firm believer in the future of artificial intelligence (AI), as he's invested in several companies leading in this industry. Certain AI companies remain in his portfolio -- likeAmazon-- but he's recently exited others. He sold two of 2024's biggest AI winners,Nvidia(NVDA0.87%)andPalantir Technologies. He closed out his position in the former in the third quarter of last year and sold all of the latter in the first quarter of this year. Investors don't know the exact reason for the Palantir cut, though it's reasonable to guess valuation may have had something to do with it. The stock trades for 237x forward earnings estimates today, prompting some to say it's gotten too expensive and may be set for declines. Druckenmiller clearly cares about this element because he's said Nvidia's high valuation pushed him toward the exit door. Even though Nvidia's valuation has indeed climbed, this billionaire said selling Nvidia was a mistake. \"I'm licking my wounds from a bad sale,\" he told Bloomberg in an interview last year, and suggested he would consider buying the stock again at the right price. Druckenmiller hasn't done that yet -- but it's something to watch for in coming quarters as Nvidia's valuation has come down quite a bit over the past several months. Meanwhile, this top investor just made a huge move on another AI stock that has a close relationship with Nvidia. Here's a closer look. Image source: Getty Images. First, it's worth keeping your eye on Druckenmiller's moves as he has a strong track record of successful stock picking. This dates back to his 30 years of delivering a 30% average annual return -- and never posting a money-losing year -- as head of Duquesne Capital Management. Now he's leading the Duquesne family office and oversees $3 billion, and his moves could offer investors some inspiration when they go shopping for stocks. What sort of big AI move did Druckenmiller make in the first quarter? He increased his holding ofTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(TSM-0.17%)by 457% to 598,780 shares. TSMC is the company that brings some of today's most sought-after products to life: AI chips. Nvidia andAdvanced Micro Devices, two AI chip giants, design their chips but don't manufacture them. They and many other companies turn to TSMC for this. When demand for these chips is high, it not only benefits Nvidia and other chip designers, but also benefits TSMC. You can see that in the company'srevenue and profit, which have steadily climbed in recent years.  TSM Revenue (Annual)data byYCharts. In the first quarter, TSMC said revenue advanced 35% to more than $25 billion, and profitability on sales has been strong, too, with gross margin in the high 50% range. You might wonder: What's the advantage of investing in TSMC over one particularly strong chip leader? By investing in TSMC, you don't have to bet on one particular chip designer dominating throughoutthe AI boom. Instead, you can benefit from the successes of all of these players, since TSMC is producing their chips. TSMC also could see additional gains ahead as it's dramatically increased its investment in U.S. manufacturing, putting it right at the doorstep of major customers. Earlier this year, the company said it would boost its investment in chip manufacturing by $100 billion. This will fund three new fabs, two advanced packaging sites, and a research and development space. With this move, the company's total U.S. investment will reach $165 billion. Meanwhile, TSMC has been trading at a bargain price since the start of the year, with the stock at less than 25xforward earnings estimates. Considering all of these points, it's not surprising that Druckenmiller significantly lifted his position in the stock. This buy might be seen as a bet on Nvidia, too, as strong demand for the company's chips will likely lead to higher revenue for TSMC as the manufacturer of those chips. With this purchase, Druckenmiller may be setting himself up for a Nvidia-driven win once again.",

        "content": "Arm HoldingsARM is increasingly at risk of slower growth in China due to the country\u2019s accelerating pivot toward RISC-V architecture. In fiscal 2025, China was the company\u2019s second-largest revenue source after the United States, contributing 19% of its total sales. However, revenues from China rose only 7.5% year over year, a concerning signal in a country with deep chip demand and vast industrial needs. This sluggish pace appears tightly linked to China\u2019s growing ambition to localize its semiconductor ecosystem. As part of this strategy, the Chinese government is preparing to promote RISC-V, an open-source chip architecture, as an alternative to Arm\u2019s and x86\u2019s proprietary models. Because RISC-V enables customization without licensing fees, it offers significant cost advantages and design flexibility, which are key priorities for China as it seeks to reduce dependence on Western technologies amid ongoing geopolitical tensions. The Chinese ecosystem is already moving fast. Major tech firms such as Alibaba Cloud, Huawei, Tencent and ZTE are premier members of RISC-V International. Alibaba\u2019s XuanTie and Nuclei System Technology are leading domestic providers of RISC-V chips, and the recent unveiling of RIVAI Technologies\u2019 high-performance Lingyu server chip demonstrates China\u2019s growing capabilities in advanced RISC-V innovation. As the Chinese government finalizes policy guidance to back this transition, Arm\u2019s foothold may weaken further, especially if local champions continue gaining traction. While Arm may feel the brunt of China\u2019s RISC-V push, NVIDIA NVDA and AMD AMD are watching closely. NVIDIA has a deep exposure in AI hardware and data centers, both critical segments where RISC-V could encroach if local alternatives scale effectively. Its ecosystem depends on international design freedom \u2014 something RISC-V threatens in China\u2019s closed-loop ambitions. Meanwhile, AMD faces a similar challenge. Its EPYC server chips compete directly with China\u2019s new Lingyu RISC-V server chip. If adoption accelerates in China, AMD\u2019s market share in hyperscale and enterprise deployments could erode. Both NVIDIA and AMD now must navigate a dual challenge \u2014 innovation and geopolitical barriers. With China leaning into RISC-V, both companies will likely reassess their regional strategies as Arm\u2019s struggles become theirs as well.

        "content": "Welcome back to The Week in AI. I'm Kevin Cook, your field guide and storyteller for the fascinating arena of artificial intelligence.On Friday, my colleague Ethan Feller and I ran through a dozen developments that are transforming the economy right before our eyes. Here were 7 of the highlights...1) Jensen at NVIDIA GTC Paris: \"We are going to sell hundreds of billions worth of GB200/300.\"CEO Jensen Huang has forecast spending on AI-enabled data centers will double to $2 trillion over the next four to five years. As Grace Blackwell systems deploy, with 208 billion transistors per GPU -- or nearly 15 trillion per GB200 NVL72 rack system --NVIDIANVDA engineers are building the roadmap for Rubin and Feynman systems with likely orders of magnitude greater power.This is something I've talked about repeatedly for the past year: Wall Street analysts and investors are vastly underestimating the potential of the AI economy and the upgrades in infrastructure that need to occur to support self-driving cars, humanoid robots, and other autonomous machines.And this doesn't include sovereign nation-states that need to build their own AI infrastructure for security and growth.If you ever need clarity about the AI Revolution, or just to recalibrate your expectations and convictions, there is one place you need to visit: the NVIDIA Newsroom -- especially around a GPU Tech Conference (GTC). (I show you where in the video.)For last week's Paris GTC, they rolled out 6 press releases and 19 blogs covering as many new innovations and partnerships across industry, enterprise, science and healthcare.Nobody Wanted AI GPUs in 2016Jensen also retells the story of the first DGX-1 in 2016. It was the mini supercomputer about the size of a college dorm fridge and it held 8 Volta GPUs with 21 billion transistors each.And nobody wanted it. Except a little startup called OpenAI.I like to use this story as an example of how NVIDIA has been in a very unique position ever since. They don't have to find \"product-market fit\" like most companies. Instead, they have been inventing a stack that developers didn't know they needed.Get the whole story in the replay of last Friday's The Week in AI: The Reasoning Wars, Sam's Love Letter, Zuck's Land Grab.Even if you don't have time for the 60-minute replay, at least do a quick scroll of the comments where I post all the relevant links to the topics we discussed.With over 25 links, you are guaranteed to find something that answers your top questions about the AI revolution!2) The New Civil War In AI: Not Safety, But EfficacyThere are many exciting debates going on in \"the revolution\" right now. A recent hot conflict is over whether or not the LLMs (large language models) are doing real reasoning, and even thinking.This one heated up afterAppleAAPL researchers released their paper \"The Illusion of Thinking: Understanding the Strengths and Limitations of Reasoning Models.\"We are amazed by the research, writing, pattern-finding and puzzle-solving of these models. But Apple researchers found some limitations where the models \"give up\" on large problems without enough context.And it's worth pondering if they are simply \"token prediction\" machines that eventually get wrapped around their own axles.I've experienced this with some of the \"vibe-coding\" app developer tools like Replit and Bolt.But then other analysts and papers quickly responded and surfaced with the \"limitations\" of the Apple research, suggesting that the imposed cost expenditure limits imposed were the defining factor in the models giving up.One of the rebuttal papers was titled \"The Illusion of the Illusion of Thinking.\" Again, all these links are in the comments section of The Week in AI.3) Google Offers Buyouts: AI Headcount Crunch Beginning?My third topic was once again about the employment impact from generative AI and agentic AI being adopted in corporations.I ran a query on ChatGPT for the \"top 100 jobs most likely to be disrupted\" in the next 3 years. You can find the link in the comments of the X Space.Another tangible angle on job displacement was the revolutionary ad during the NBA finals by the prediction market platform Kalshi. It was created using the new Veo 3 graphics creator from Google by a filmmaker named PJ Ace.Ethan and I discussed how this innovation is certain to disrupt advertising, marketing, and film as the machines can do in minutes what it used to take a team of people weeks.And wait until you see the new Veo 3 ad from a Los Angeles dentist that is taking social media by storm. We'll talk about that in this Friday's Space.Welcome to the MachineBut the most eye-opening news flash for me was the story on a company called Mechanize. While lots of job displacement will happen organically, this outfit is like a mercenary going after headcount.The New York Times titled their article \"This A.I. Company Wants to Take Your Job.\"And here's how an X post described the piece about the startup that wants to automate white-collar work \"as fast as possible\"...\"Mechanize wants to abolish all jobs. They make no secret of this. They are developing an AI program that is extremely promising and is being financed by everyone from Google to Stripe.\"Then there is Anthropic co-founder Ben Mann saying we'll know AI is transformative when it passes the \"Economic Turing Test:Give an AI agent a job for a month. Let the hiring manager choose: human or machine? When they pick the machine more often than not, we've crossed the threshold.\"I have several posts in the comments of the \"The Week in AI\" X Space on the employment wars. Plus, just about every post is from a particular source of AI insight or expertise whose account you should be following on X.4) Marc Andreessen: \"All incumbents are gonna get nuked. Everything gets rebuilt.\"Translation:AI isn't an economic upgrade. It's a total reset.Which brings me to my favorite part of our Friday X Space...Cooker's RANT of the WEEK: \"The Magical AI Transformation Won't Be So Gentle.\" Here I take the other side of Sam Altman's blog post from last week titled \"The Gentle Singularity.\"I call it his \"love letter\" not to make fun of him, but to highlight his optimism in the face of brewing storms.A few weeks ago it was Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei warning us about the rapid disruption of work and its impacts on citizens and families, not just the economy. Then the old wise-man of AI, Geoffrey Hinton, shared these sentiments in a recent interview...The best-case future is a \"symbiosis between people and AI\" -- where machines handle the mundane, and humans live more interesting lives.But in the kind of society we have now, he warns, AI won't free most people. It will concentrate power, and as massive productivity increases create joblessness, it will mostly benefit the rich.This sober view instantly made me think of the 2016 book by Yuval Noah Harari Homo Deus in which the historian described how technology usually gets concentrated in the hands of the rich and powerful. It's just how economics works, no matter the political flavor.In this way, AI can move quickly beyond issues of personal safety, to those of economic security. In the X Space replay and the comments below it, I discuss the implications of \"post-labor economics\" as well as share more expert resources on these topics.Be sure to catch the replay of The Week in AI to hear my sense of the \"not-so-gentle\" transition we are headed into.5) Apple WWDC: The Non-Event of the Week in AIFor what to expect (or not) from Apple in AI innovation, I always turn to Robert Scoble on X @Scobleizer. Here were some of his summary posts...Cynical take on Apple's WWDC: just doing things Microsoft did back in 2003. Liquid glass. Menus on tablets.Dark take on it: it's way behind in AI, and didn't demonstrate any attempt to catch up.Light take: Lots of new AI features, like your phone will wait on hold for you now.Hopeful take: the new design joins Apple Vision Pro into its ecosystem, showing that the Apple Vision Pro is the future of Apple.Scoble adds: I really hate the recorded product demos and the old people showing new features and attempting to be \"hip.\"On a more Apple-positive note, Scoble is looking forward to the next devices which should be coming in the AR space...Later this year both Apple and Google are introducing heavyweight category wearables. Lighter than the first Vision Pro.We will judge them by who has the best AI inside.That is more important than resolution.Google, today, looks like it is way ahead and pulling further away because this is a game of exponents.I will buy both anyway. :-)(end of @Scobleizer rants)Many experts are sensing thatAlphabetGOOGL is \"firing on all cylinders across AI\" as we've discussed previously. From Gemini 2.5 Pro and the astonishing new Veo 3 to building AI capabilities with their own with TPUs (instead of relying on NVIDIA GPUs), they're the only vertically-integrated player across all realms of tech.Google will probably also figure out the shift from classic search to generative search, as Daniel Newman of the Futurum technology research group says. Reports of Google's demise have been greatly exaggerated according to @DanielNewmanUV and I wish I was listening before I sold my shares on the last \"search is dead\" scare.6) Zuck Splashes the Pot with $14.3 BillionMeta PlatformsMETA plunked down that amount for only 49% of a private company called Scale AI. But the price tag made it the biggest pure-AI acquisition, following OpenAI's $6 billion purchase of Jony Ive's company.Just like Sam wasn't waiting around to find out what AI-native device Apple will build, so too Zuck isn't waiting around for permission to have access to the premier company in the data supply chain -- what some are calling the oil refinery of the AI economy.What does that mean? Well if you think about data as various grades of crude oil, it needs to be cleaned and prepped in a number of ways before it can be \"mined and modeled\" for quality results.That's where Scale AI comes in with data prep and labeling because major AI models need structured and labeled training data to generate knowledge tokens, insights, and deep learning.Scale AI is a San Francisco-based artificial intelligence company founded in 2016 by Alexandr Wang and Lucy Guo. The company specializes in providing high-quality data labeling, annotation, and model evaluation services that are essential for training advanced AI models, including large language models (LLMs) and generative AI systems.Scale AI is known for its robust data engine, which powers AI development for leading tech firms, government agencies, and startups worldwide. Its research division, the Safety, Evaluation and Alignment Lab (SEAL), focuses on evaluating and aligning AI models for safety and reliability7) AMD Unveils AI Server Rack, Sam on Stage with LisaI am still shaking my head at all the stuff that happened last week! As if all of the above wasn't enough,Advanced Micro DevicesAMD held its annual Advancing AI conference last Thursday with a product roadmap for hyperscale inferencing that caught investor attention.In addition to leaps forward in performance for the existing Instinct MI350 Series GPU systems, AMD CEO Lisa Su unveiled the Helios AI Rack-scale architecture supporting up to 72 MI400 GPUs, with 432GB of HBM4 memory per GPU and 19.6 TB/sec bandwidth. Available in 2026, this is clearly an answer to NVIDIA's GB200/300 series rack systems.AI Market Growth: CEO Lisa Su projected an 80% increase in AI inference demand by 2026, driven by the rapid adoption and expansion of AI applications in enterprise and cloud environments.Roadmap: AMD reaffirmed its commitment to an annual cadence of AI chip releases, with the MI400 and MI450 series already in development and expected to challenge Nvidia\u2019s flagship offerings in 2026 and beyond.And then Sam Altman showed up during Lisa's keynote. Since he clearly can't get enough compute or GPUs, he's as tight with Lisa as he is with Jensen.Lisa welcomed the founder and CEO of OpenAI as a key design partner for AMD's upcoming MI450 GPU who will help shape the next generation of AMD's AI hardware. OpenAI will use AMD GPUs and Helios servers for advanced AI workloads, including ChatGPT.And AMD's other happy customers continue to come back for more with Meta deploying AMD Instinct MI300X GPUs for Llama 3/4 inference and collaborating on future MI350/MI400 platforms.Meanwhile Microsoft Azure runs proprietary and open-source models on AMD Instinct MI300X GPUs in production and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure will deploy zettascale AI clusters with up to 131,072 MI355X GPUs, offering massive AI compute capacity to customers.This event made AMD shares a clear buy last week -- and this week if you can still grab some under $130!OLD RANT: The Fundamental DifferenceFinally, did you hear what another OpenAI co-founder said at the University of Toronto commencement address? Ilya Sutskever, the OpenAI architect and deep learning pioneer who in 2024 started his own model firm, Safe Superintelligence, spoke these words to the new grads...\"The day will come when AI will do all the things we can do. The reason is the brain is a biological computer, so why can't the digital computer do the same things?\"It's funny that we are debating if AI can truly think or give the illusion of thinking, as if our biological brain is superior or fundamentally different from a digital brain.\"I had to dig out my old rant about the fundamental difference(s) between human brains and computer \"thinking.\" If you haven't heard me on this, you owe it to yourself so you can easily explain the differences to other \"intelligence experts\" telling you how consciousness works.Bottom line:To stay informed in AI, listen to The Week in AI replay, or just go to that post to see all the links and sources.

        "content": "Bill GatesbackedTerraPower has closed a $650 million round led by Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) NVentures to fuel its first Natrium reactor as AI's power demands surge. The funding, which brings Nvidia's venture arm alongside existing investors like Gates and HD Hyundai, comes as TerraPower advances toward regulatory approval for its Natrium plantpoised to be the U.S.'s inaugural commercial advanced nuclear facility with modular, streamlined construction. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. Non-nuclear work kicked off last year, and with construction ramping up, this capital infusion will cover engineering, licensing and early site development. UBS (NYSE:UBS) served as the exclusive placement agent, and TerraPower remains privately held. As AI and data centers gobble electricity, reliable, carbon-free power is critical. Nvidia's entry signals tech leaders betting on next-gen nuclear to meet soaring energy needs. If Natrium succeeds, it could reshape the energy landscapeproviding stable baseload that complements intermittent renewables and fuels compute-hungry AI. Watch for TerraPower's licensing milestones and initial reactor blueprints next year. Success could pave the way for similar modular plants worldwideand cement nuclear's role in powering tomorrow's AI revolution. This article first appeared onGuruFocus.",
