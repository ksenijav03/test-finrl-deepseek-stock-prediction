        "content": "Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)-backed OpenAI has no active plans to use Alphabet unit Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) tensor processing units, or TPUs, the company said following media reports that the AI startup was planning to use rival Google's chips to meet growing demand, Reuters reported.  A spokesperson for OpenAI told the news agency that OpenAI is in early testing with some of Google's TPUs, but it has no plans to deploy them at scale right now, the report added.  OpenAI is actively using Nvidia's graphics processing units, or GPUs, and AMD's (NASDAQ:AMD) AI chips to power its growing demand, the report noted.  A potential deal for Google's TPUs could have marked a supplier diversification for OpenAI, which has relied on Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) chips in the past to train its AI models and for inference computing. On Monday, analysts from Morgan Stanley said in a research note that potential usage of Google's chips for inferencing OpenAI's AI workloads would have been a significant endorsement of Google's hardware.  Over the weekend, it was reported that OpenAI has started using Google-made AI chips to build its products. However, it was noted that Google was not providing the most powerful TPUs to OpenAI, signaling its plans to use its most advanced versions to power the company's internal projects, including its own large language model Gemini.  Last month, OpenAI, reportedly, signed a deal with Google Cloud for the AI company's computing needs.",

        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) stocks are shaping up to be the biggest stocks of the decade. Stocks likeNvidiaandPalantirhave generated huge returns and created massive fortunes already. However, there are other, less well-known AI stocks, too. Today, let's examine one from the fascinating field of voice AI,SoundHoundAI(SOUN-2.33%). Image source: Getty Images. To get started, let's examinethe reasonswhy SoundHound stock looks like a buy right now. First, the company is growing incredibly fast. As of its most recent quarter (for the three months ending on March 31, 2025), SoundHound reported eye-poppingrevenuegrowth of 151%, with quarterly revenue rising from $11.6 million to $29.1 million. The automotive and restaurant sectors remain key drivers of SoundHound's growth, and thesewere highlightedduring its earnings release: In addition, the company announced the expansion of several existing partnerships and the start of numerous new pilot programs across theretail,healthcare, andfinancial servicessectors. Thisongoingmomentum points toward the potential growth of SoundHound'stotal addressable market (TAM),as organizations continue to reimagine how they can use AI tocutcostsand increase productivity. Finally, the analyst community remains bullish on SoundHound stock.Accordingto data compiled by Yahoo! Finance, five of the eightsell-side analystscovering SoundHound stock rate it as a \"strong buy\" or \"buy.\" None rate it as a sell. The average analyst price target is $11.81, implying19% upside as of this writing. Now, let's examine the bear case and risks for SoundHound stock. First, one must remember that SoundHound is a very young andverysmallcompany.Its total revenue over the last 12 months amounted to $102 million. For comparison,Meta Platformsgenerates five times as much revenueevery day. Accordingly, SoundHound isn't yet profitable, and, crucially, it doesn't generate positive free cash flow. Over the last 12 months, SoundHound reported a net loss of $188 million and free cash flow of negative $107 million. However, these risksare somewhat offsetby the fact that SoundHound has a solid balance sheet, with more than $245 million in cash and only $5 million in debt. In addition to its lack of profits, the company's competitive situation raises other concerns. The AI ecosystem isextremelydynamic, with deep-pocketed companies eagerly jumping into new businesses.It'squite possible that bigtech giants likeMicrosoft,Amazon,Alphabet, Meta,orothers could become fierce competitors for SoundHound.On the other hand, any of theaforementioned companiescould also gobble up SoundHound -- its current market cap of less than $4 billion is but a rounding error for the tech giants. Finally, SoundHound's deep penetration of the automotive and hospitality sectorsisa double-edged sword.With much of the company's revenue coming from those industries, any downturns within those sectors couldputadamperonSoundHound's rapid growth, leaving investors out in the cold. SoundHound is a young company in a dynamic and fast-changing industry. However, it's not a stock for every investor. Its high valuation -- at the time of this writing its price-to-sales(P/S) ratiois 36 -- puts it well out of reach for value-minded investors. However, for growth-seeking investorswho arelooking for a mid-cap stock with plenty of upside, SoundHound is worth considering. A dollar-cost averaging approach, combined with a buy-and-holdmindset,could pay off as the voice AI market continues to grow in the years to come.",

        "header": "Can Nvidia Stock Reach $200 This Year?",
        "content": "Nvidia(NVDA-2.87%)stock is back in the market's good graces after plunging earlier this year. Despite reassurances from management, investors were worried about the company's future when China's DeepSeek chatbot came out and further concerned about impact of new tariffs. As Nvidia continues to report stellar earnings results and upgrade its technology amid a pause on many of the new tariffs, investors are feeling more love toward Nvidia stock. As of this writing, Nvidia stock trades just north of $150, and it's back to beating the market. Can it reach $200 before the end of the year? Nvidia makes the semiconductor chips necessary to drive generative artificial intelligence (AI), or the apps that \"think\" and create. There are two basic stages to that process: training and inference. The large-language models that run the data and produce output need a tremendous amount of power for these processes, training on millions of data points that are constantly updated and running through tons of algorithms to create accurate content and images. Nvidia's chips make that happen. Image source: Getty Images. Since so many tech companies want to use generative AI in their operations today, Nvidia's chips are in great demand. Although there are alternatives, Nvidia has between 70% and 95% of the market, depending on who you ask. Even at the lower end, that's a huge lead over the competition. As the gold standard, Nvidia is relied upon by the biggest companies likeMicrosoftandAmazonas a partner. This is where the greatest opportunity is. Amazon, for one, has its own line of budget options for smaller companies, but the large, brand-name clients it services need Nvidia's powerful chips. The demand is only expected to increase. According to Statista, the AI opportunity is expected to increase at acompound annual growth rateof 26.6% over the next five years, reaching $1 trillion. A huge portion of that is likely to go to Nvidia. Management continues to launch new products that can handle higher data loads, making them more attractive to clients. Its Blackwell technology, which launched last year to replace the Hopper architecture, is already moving into Blackwell Ultra, and management is planning to release a new range of chips next year under the Rubin name. In the near term, Nvidia continues to report phenomenal results despite serious setbacks. U.S. regulations mean it can't ship its best chips to China, stymying progress in that market, and Nvidia took a hit to its earnings in the fiscal 2026 first quarter (ended April 27) related to a charge for orders it couldn't fulfill. Yet the first-quarter results were outstanding. Revenue increased 69% year over year, and earnings per share (EPS) were up from $0.60 last year to $0.76 this year, inclusive of the one-time charge. Management is guiding for growth to decelerate in the second quarter but remain high at a 50% increase year over year.Wall Streetis looking for EPS of $1, up from $0.68 last year. For the full year, Wall Street is expecting $200 billion in revenue and $4.29 in EPS, up from $130 billion (a 54% increase) and $2.99 (a 43% increase) over last year. If the valuation remains constant, Nvidia stock will rise along with its earnings. If it rises 54% from where it started out this year, it will reach $212. If it rises 43%, it will reach $197. If nothing much changes and Nvidia meets Wall Street's expectations, the stock should surpass $200 by the end of the year. However, Nvidia tends to beat expectations. If that happens, it could rise further. High-growth stocks can also carry higher valuations. If Nvidia's valuation rises, the price could also rise further. At the current price, Nvidia stock trades at aprice-to-earnings ratioof 50 and aprice-to-sales ratioof 26. Those aren't cheap numbers, but they're pretty reasonable for Nvidia's growth. The likelihood is that Nvidia hits at least $200 before the end of the year, or shoots 27% higher than the price at the time of this writing.",

        "content": "By Max A. Cherney, Jeffrey Dastin and Stephen Nellis SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -Intel's new chief executive is exploring a big change to its contract manufacturing business to win major customers, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters, in a potentially expensive shift from his predecessor's plans. If implemented, the new strategy for what Intel calls its \"foundry\" business would entail no longer marketing certain chipmaking technology, which the company had long developed, to external customers, the people said. Since taking the company's helm in March, CEO Lip-Bu Tan has moved fast to cut costs and find a new path to revive the ailing U.S. chipmaker. By June, he started voicing that a manufacturing process that prior CEO Pat Gelsinger bet heavily on, known as 18A, was losing its appeal to new customers, said the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. To put aside external sales of 18A and its variant 18A-P, manufacturing processes that have cost Intel billions of dollars to develop, the company would have to take a write-off, one of the people familiar with the matter said. Industry analysts contacted by Reuters said such a charge could amount to a loss of hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars. Intel declined to comment on such \"hypothetical scenarios or market speculation.\" It said the lead customer for 18A has long been Intel itself, and it aims to ramp production of its \"Panther Lake\" laptop chips later in 2025, which it called the most advanced processors ever designed and manufactured in the United States. Persuading outside clients to use Intel's factories remains key to its future. As its 18A fabrication process faced delays, rival TSMC's N2 technology has been on track for production. Tan's preliminary answer to this challenge: focus more resources on 14A, a next-generation chipmaking process where Intel expects to have advantages over Taiwan's TSMC, the two sources said. The move is part of a play for big customers like Apple and Nvidia, which currently pay TSMC to manufacture their chips. Tan has tasked the company with teeing up options for discussion with Intel's board when it meets as early as this month, including whether to stop marketing 18A to new clients, one of the two sources said. The board might not reach a decision on 18A until a subsequent autumn meeting in light of the matter's complexity and the enormous money at stake, the person said. Intel declined to comment on what it called rumor. In a statement, it said: \"Lip-Bu and the executive team are committed to strengthening our roadmap, building trust with our customers, and improving our financial position for the future. We have identified clear areas of focus and will take actions needed to turn the business around.\" Last year was Intel's first unprofitable year since 1986. It posted a net loss attributable to the company of $18.8 billion for 2024. The Intel chief executive's deliberations show the enormous risks - and costs - under consideration to move the storied U.S. chipmaker back onto solid footing. Like Gelsinger, Tan inherited a company that had lost its manufacturing edge and fell behind on crucial technology waves of the past two decades: mobile computing and artificial intelligence. The company is targeting high-volume production later this year for 18A with its internal chips, which are widely expected to arrive ahead of external customer orders. Meanwhile, delivering 14A in time to win major contracts is by no means certain, and Intel could choose to stick with its existing plans for 18A, one of the sources said. Intel is tailoring 14A to key clients' needs to make it successful, the company said. AMAZON AND MICROSOFT ON 18A Tan's review of whether to focus clients on 14A involves the contract chipmaking portion of Intel, or foundry, which makes chips for external customers. Regardless of a board decision, Intel will make chips via 18A in cases where its plans are already in motion, the people familiar with the matter said. This includes using 18A for Intel's in-house chips that it already designed for that manufacturing process, the people said. Intel also will produce a relatively small volume of chips that it has guaranteed for Amazon.com and Microsoft via 18A, with deadlines that make it unrealistic to wait for the development of 14A. Amazon and Microsoft did not immediately comment on the matter. Intel said it will deliver on its customer commitments. Tan's overall strategy for Intel remains nascent. So far, he has updated his leadership team, bringing in new engineering talent, and he has worked to shrink what he considered bloated and slow-moving middle management. Shifting away from selling 18A to foundry customers would represent one of his biggest moves yet. The 18A manufacturing process includes a novel method of delivering energy to chips and a new type of transistor. Together, these enhancements were meant to let Intel match or exceed TSMC's capabilities, Intel executives have previously said. However, according to some industry analysts, the 18A process is roughly equivalent to TSMC's so-called N3 manufacturing technology, which went into high-volume production in late 2022. If Intel follows Tan's lead, the company would focus its foundry employees, design partners and new customers on 14A, where it hopes for a better chance to compete against TSMC. Tan has drawn on extensive contacts and customer relationships built over decades in the chip industry to arrive at his view on 18A, the two sources said. (Reporting by Jeffrey Dastin, Max A.

        "content": "Ford (F) shares jumped Tuesday after the automaker reported a big jump in U.S. sales and an increase in market share in the second quarter. The company said that sales rose 14.2% in the second quarter versus a year ago, as demand for pickup trucks and SUVs surged. Ford estimated that its market share grew 1.8 percentage points from the first quarter to 14.3%. The solid numbers come amid concerns about possible declines in new car sales over the coming months as manufacturers incorporate tariff costs into vehicle prices.\u00a0When Ford released its first-quarter financial results in May, the company said itwould not provide full-year earnings guidanceamid uncertainty about the impact of tariffs. Ford shares have gained nearly 15% since the start of the year, handily outpacing theS&P 500\u2019s 5% return over the same period. The stock rose 4.6% to $11.35 on Tuesday. Below, we take a closer look at Ford\u2019s chart and usetechnical analysisto point out price levels that investors will likely be watching.

Further buying could see the shares test overheadresistancearound $11.50. The shares may face selling pressure in this area near the May 2024 trough, which also closely aligns with a series ofpeaksthat formed on the chart between August and November last year. The next higher area to watch lies at $13. This location may provide resistance near minor peaks that developed on the chart last year in March and April. A close above this area could drive a move toward $13.60. Investors who bought the stock at lower levels may look tolock in profitsin this region near a range of prices situated just below the April 2024 high and an area that preceded last July\u2019s prominentstock gap.

        "content": "Nvidia(NVDA0.29%)andMicrosoft(MSFT-0.62%)shares have advanced 18% year to date, while theS&P 500(^GSPC-0.11%)has gained 6% as of June 30. Some Wall Street analysts expect that momentum to carry the companies to a major milestone in the coming months. Specifically, both could achieve market values of $5 trillion before the end of 2026. Here's what investors should know about Nvidia and Microsoft. Image source: Getty Images. Nvidia develops accelerated computing solutions. The company is best known forgraphics processing units, chips that accelerate complex data center workloads likeartificial intelligence(AI). Nvidia accounts for about 90% of AI accelerator sales today and analysts generally expect the company to maintain its market dominance for the foreseeable future despite competition fromBroadcomandAMD. Beyond that, Nvidia is also the market leader in networking gear used to supportgenerative AIworkloads. The company recently added two major customers inAlphabet's Google Cloud andMeta Platforms, both of which will deploy Nvidia Spectrum-X Ethernet networking platform in their data centers. The company also has a burgeoning software and services business. Nvidia reported first-quarter financial results that beat expectations on the top and bottom lines. Revenue rose 69% to $44 billion due to robust demand for AI infrastructure, andnon-GAAPnet income increased 33% to $0.81 per diluted share. Importantly, earnings would have increased more quickly had it not been for newchip export restrictionsrelated to its China business. Wall Street expects Nvidia's adjusted earnings to increase at 41% annually through the fiscal year ending in January 2027. That makes the current valuation of 50times adjusted earningslook reasonable. And if Nvidia's earnings do increase at 41% annually, its market value could hit $5 trillion in the next year while its price-to-earnings multiple falls to 46. Patient investors should feel comfortable owning Nvidia at its current price. Microsoft generates most of its revenue from enterprise software and cloud computing. While the company is best known for its leadership in office productivity software, it also has a strong position in enterprise resource planning, business intelligence, and several cybersecurity software verticals. Also, Microsoft Azure is the second largest public cloud in terms of infrastructure and platform services spending. Central to the company's growth strategy is artificial intelligence. Microsoft 365 Copilot is a generative AI assistant that can summarize content and make recommendations in office applications like Word and Excel. Copilot Studio is a low-code platform that lets customers design custom AI agents. And Azure AI Foundry is a cloud service that lets developers train machine learning models and build AI applications. Microsoft reported solid financial results in the third quarter of fiscal 2025, which ended in March. Revenue increased 13% to $70 billion on particularly strong momentum in Azure, driven by demand for AI services. In addition, the number of customers using Microsoft 365 Copilot increased threefold. Meanwhile,GAAPnet income increased 18% to $3.46 per diluted share. Grand View Research estimates software-as-a-service revenue will grow at 12% annually through 2030, while cloud services sales increase at 20% annually during the same period. So, Microsoft has a reasonably good shot at achieving double-digit annual revenue growth through the end of the decade. Indeed, Wall Street estimates Microsoft's earnings will increase at 13% annually through the fiscal year ending in June 2026. However, that consensus still makes the current valuation of 38 times earnings look expensive. Microsoft may reach $5 trillion in the next 18 months, but I would personally avoid buying the stock until the price is more reasonable.",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Investors may be tempted to imagine how much higher the S&P 500 Index would be if three of its most influential stocks weren\u2019t lagging behind. Most Read from Bloomberg Struggling Downtowns Are Looking to Lure New Crowds California Exempts Building Projects From Environmental Law What Gothenburg Got Out of Congestion Pricing New York Port Authority Shut Down Due to Multi-Bus Accident Apple Inc., the third-most-valuable company in the S&P 500, has seen its shares drop 17% this year amid tariff concerns and problems developing artificial intelligence services. Alphabet Inc., the $2.1 trillion internet advertising giant, is down 7% amid fears that AI chatbots will eat into its lucrative Google search business. Meanwhile, Tesla Inc. is down 26% amid slumping electric vehicle sales. Those three stocks have been a more than 120 point drag on the market-capitalization weighted S&P 500, which closed on Tuesday with a gain of about 5% on the year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. All else equal, if the trio were to at least erase losses for 2025, the benchmark would be about two percentage points higher. \u201cThe rally is broadening, but the Mag 7 make up such a massive proportion of the overall market that if they stall, by definition the market will struggle,\u201d said Paul Stanley, chief investment officer at Granite Bay Wealth Management. After leading the market higher for more than two years, Magnificent Seven stocks have diverged in 2025 with Microsoft Corp., Nvidia Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc. all up 14% or more. The most common difference between winners and losers in 2025 has been AI: firms such as Nvidia have capitalized on computing infrastructure spending while those like Meta have utilized the technology to drive revenue growth. On the other hand, Apple has struggled to integrate AI features into its devices since unveiling its vision of \u201cAI for the rest of us\u201d over a year ago. The stock is up more than 3% this week after Bloomberg News reported it\u2019s considering using AI technology from Anthropic or OpenAI to power a new version of its Siri assistant. \u201cIt makes sense that people aren\u2019t pouring additional dollars into Apple right now until they have some kind of blueprint for what they\u2019re going to be doing with AI,\u201d said Paul Marino, chief revenue officer of Themes ETFs. While Microsoft, Nvidia and Meta have been responsible for roughly half of the S&P 500\u2019s gains this year, Netflix Inc., Broadcom Inc. and Palantir Technologies Inc. have also been big contributors. The index is trading near a record high. The Magnificent Seven, which also includes Amazon.com Inc., accounts for about a third of the S&P 500, roughly the same as the combined weighting of 7 of the benchmark\u2019s 11 main sectors. Amazon shares are roughly flat in 2025. While a broadening of the rally is encouraging, Granite Bay\u2019s Stanley says it\u2019s unlikely to overcome the drag from the likes of Apple if the underperformance continues in the second half of the year. \u201cYou would really need to see a strong broad market to compensate for weakness in the Mag 7 and I don\u2019t know what can break the rest of the Mag 7 out of their range,\u201d Stanley said. Tech Chart of the Day China faces growing calls from policy advisers and economists to explore using stablecoins for cross-border payments, as the US moves to entrench the dollar\u2019s dominance through the still-emerging technology. While China maintains a sweeping ban on crypto activities, recent remarks from senior central bank officials have given fresh momentum to discussions about their potential role in global payments.

        "content": "Nvidia(NVDA0.29%)is now the largest publicly traded company in the world, with a market capitalization of nearly $4 trillion. Wall Street is swooning over the stock in the days of major artificial intelligence (AI) investment. \"We are entering the next 'Golden Wave' of Gen AI adoption, and NVDA is at the front-end of another material leg of stronger than anticipated demand,\" says Ananda Baruah, an analyst at Loop Capital. \"We remind folks that NVDA remains essentially a monopoly for critical tech, and that it has pricing (and margin) power.\" Despite the fanfare, there's actuallyanothermajorAI stockthat has quietly outperformed Nvidia this year. Most people have heard of this business, but few understand how well it is positioned for the next decade of artificial intelligence growth. Investors have been referring toIBM(IBM-0.28%)as \"Big Blue\" for decades. In the past, the company was known as a technology heavyweight. Over time, however, many of its business segments stalled, being overtaken by more nimble competition. IBM never stopped investing in critical sectors like AI, however. Today, those investments are paying off big. IBM'sgenerative AIbusiness is already producing $6 billion in annual revenue. Considering demand for AI solutions is expected to grow by more than 30% over the next decade, this could soon become one of IBM's biggest profit drivers. Quantum computing is also an exciting business opportunity for IBM. The firm recently unveiled its \"Quantum Starling\" roadmap, which anticipates a large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computer by 2030. In layman's terms, IBM thinks it will be one of the first, if notthefirst, to launch a flexible quantum computer that can handle complex requests at scale -- a historic breakthrough.  NVDAdata byYCharts \"While still in the early stages of playing out, IBM is taking this multibillion-dollar quantum computing industry head-on by providing improved software and hardware capabilities to create increased use cases for various sectors,\" analysts at Wedbush recently wrote. Considering quantum computing can initiate an entirely new wave of AI innovation, IBM's dual focus on both AI and quantum computing could give it a serious long-term edge on competitors focusing on just one arena. This all begs the question: Should you ditch Nvidia stock for IBM? The answer might surprise you. Image source: Getty Images. IBM is an exciting AI stock. But there are a few things you should understand about the business versus Nvidia. First, IBM is a large, diversified company. Only a fraction of its business is currently exposed to AI tailwinds directly. That's why analysts predicts just 5.5% revenue growth for IBM this year, versus 53% revenue growth for Nvidia. While IBM does seem to be investing in all the right areas, it will take time for these investments to become meaningful drivers of both sales and profits. Second, IBM is more focused on software than hardware. Nvidia's AIGPUsare widely considered to be the best in the business. And due to its CUDA developer platform, the company has been able to maintain a market share of more than 90% for data center GPUs. IBM, meanwhile, is arguably in a much more competitive field, at least over the near term. As an analyst from Zack's Research concludes, \"IBM faces stiff competition in most of its markets.\" So while Nvidia's products remain the go-to infrastructure for the AI industry, IBM's services are merely an option among a large variety of choices. In summary, AI investors shouldn't ditch Nvidia for IBM just yet. But having exposure to both companies in your portfolio ensures that you're betting on the entire supply chain of AI -- everything from the hardware the AI revolution is being built on to the software that end consumers use.",

        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven,\" the group of stocks comprising Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOG,GOOGL), Tesla (TSLA), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Apple (AAPL), fueled market gains in 2023 and 2024. Washington Crossing Advisors senior portfolio manager Chad Morganlander and Senior ReportersBrooke DiPalmaandAllie Canaljoin Opening Bid hostBrian Sozzito take a closer look at Meta and Nvidia, examining which Magnificent Seven name is better positioned for the second half of 2025. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Catalystshere. Meta just hit a record high on Monday. Nvidia's 17% surge the past month has it knocking on the door of a $4 trillion market cap. My question is this, should you own both Meta and Nvidia in the face of their face ripping rallies? Chad, I'll start with you here. If you had to pick one of these two names in the back half of the year, which one is it? I would perhaps go with Meta, uh, there seems as if they have a continual competitive advantage and it doesn't look like they're going to be in the crosshairs of the DOJ anytime soon. Uh, with that said, I'm sorry, I'm going to pivot, uh, you want to own other companies within the MAC 7 that perhaps their valuations have been drastically discounted. Brooke, uh, you mentioned earlier on this new super intelligence unit for Meta and it sounds great. It's led by Alexander Wang, uh, who who led Scale AI sounds exciting on paper. What I can't figure out is how is this going to impact Meta's earnings this year? I don't know if it will. Well, what Mark Zuckerberg says that this is the necessity of the company. Of course, Mark Zuckerberg, the founder, the CEO of Meta, formerly known as Facebook. But what he really said here was that he believes that this is beginning of a new era for humanity and he's fully committed to doing what it takes for Meta to lead the way. Of course, Meta looking to get ahead in this AI revolution that so many companies are looking to jump on board. And as you mentioned, he's brought in top executives from AI, uh, Scale AI CEO Alexander Wang. He also brought in former GitHub CEO, uh, as well as Nat, that's Nat Friedman there. He also brought in 11 new hires who are really focused around this AI trade and he's really saying here, you know, investors really need to jump on and understand that this is not a want, a desire. This is a necessity for the company to compete in the near term and really long term here, Brian. All you know, who's really driving the future of AI? That's Jensen Huang, Nvidia. Make the case for Nvidia. Yeah, Nvidia, baby, the godfather of AI here. And we've seen mega cap stocks, especially Nvidia outperform. We were just talking about the share price move that we've seen up about 15%. We are nearing closer and closer to that $4 trillion market cap. And just a little context here, Brian. If Nvidia hits those levels, that would be valued 36% higher than the entire British stock market. That's the FTSE 100 and just 18% below the total value of Japan's Nikkei 225. So that just goes to show the sheer enthusiasm around this company, around this stock. Of course, earnings, that's huge for this company. If we see any deterioration on that front when it comes to demand along with the hyperscalers, if they hint at any sort of demand headwinds, Blackwell, obviously a big focus for a lot of those investors. If we see that, we could have a pullback in the stock. But so far, earnings have been relatively steady, moving to the upside, and I think that is the big next test for Nvidia. But I'm bullish here and I think that Nvidia is going to continue to see a lot of those gains.",

        "content": "The three best-performing stocks on theS&P 500index over the past three years, as of June 30, arePalantir Technologies(PLTR-4.09%)with a 1,403% return;Super Micro Computer(SMCI0.91%), 1,116%; andNvidia(NVDA0.29%), 943%. The S&P 500 returned 71.6% over this period. Beyond all beingartificial intelligence(AI) stocks, these three have one key commonality to which investors should give more attention: They're led by a founder-CEO. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang during his 2025 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) keynote address. Screenshot by author. Data sources: Various company data. IPO = initial public offering. **Palantir had a direct listing rather than a traditional IPO. Palantirstock's powerful performance has been driven by strong demand for the company's AI-powered software platforms for data analytics. The company sells to both government and commercial clients. Co-founder Alex Karp is its CEO. Shares of Supermicro, as the company is commonly called, have had a super run-up thanks to robust demand for the company's servers optimized for AI applications. Founder Charles Liang is CEO. Nvidiastock's stellar gains have been fueled by ferocious demand for the company's market-leading graphics processing unit (GPU) chips for training AI models and running AI applications. Co-founder Jensen Huang is CEO. It might not be just coincidental that the three biggest S&P stock winners over the last three years are all led by one of the company's founders. Studies show that founder-led companies tend to outperform the market over the long term. This makes common sense. Nobody -- not even the most loyal, hardest working person -- is going to care as much about a company's success as its founders, or at least its founders that are still involved with the company. It's likely a lot of their ego is tied up in the success of their companies -- and that can be a powerful motivating force. I recall Nvidia CEO Huang saying in an interview years ago that he was either working or thinking about work whenever he wasn't working. And many of us have probably heard thatTesla(TSLA3.49%)CEO Elon Musk has slept at theelectric vehicle(EV) pioneer's factories during critical times, such as during retooling. (While Musk isn't technically a Tesla founder, he's legally considered one. For all intents and purposes, he's acted as a founder, as he joined the company in its early days and invested huge sums of money to keep it going.) There are many factors that make a stock a good investment, so I'm certainly not suggesting that folks only invest in founder-led companies. That would leave out a huge number of well-established companies that have succeeded over many decades or even over a century. What I am suggesting is that you consider the question, \"Is this company led by a founder?\" when you're contemplating investing in a company that's young enough that it could have a founder-CEO. This factor would just be one consideration in your investing decision. The \"Magnificent Seven\" are Big Tech companies that are widely considered the market's current leaders in driving technological innovation. Their stocks have all outperformed the market -- some have absolutely crushed it -- over the long term. That all seven of them have had decent-length periods in which they were led by one of their founders lends support to the theory that founder-led companies tend to outperform over the long term. A partner at Bain & Company, a top management consulting firms, wrote this on the topic in the Harvard Business Review: \"[H]ow founders built their companies on the inside, from the start, influenced their companies' success on the outside,for a long time.\" [Emphasis mine.] Data sources: Various company sources and Wikipedia. IPO = initial public offering. Listed in order of IPO date. **Tesla CEO Elon Musk was on the company's board and its chief product architect beginning in 2004 and a major early investor before becoming CEO in 2008. Apple is unique among this group in that one of its founders -- Steve Jobs -- didn't become CEO for many years (about two decades) after the founding. But he led Apple during its most innovative period during which it released the iPod, iPhone, and iPad, and set the stage for the stock's strong, sustained run-up. In short, studies show founder-led companies tend to outperform the market over the long term -- and investors should use this knowledge in their stock-picking.",

        "header": "These Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Have Quietly Outperformed the Market All Year",
        "content": "Someartificial intelligence (AI) stocksinspire tons of headlines. You probably know exactly whatNvidia(NVDA0.29%)andMicrosoft(MSFT-0.62%)are doing in the AI space, whether their stocks are doing well or not. And then there's the quiet bunch. I can assure you thatIBM(IBM-0.28%)andMicron Technology(MU-1.39%)do plenty of AI-related business, and that they stand to benefit from this ongoing boom in generative AI. Their stocks have been outperforming theS&P 500(^GSPC-0.11%)in 2025, apart from a couple of short-lived glitches. But how often do you see them mentioned among the top AI stocks to own for the long haul? Not a whole lot, I bet. So let me tell you what these tech veterans are doing to earn consistently market-beating performance this year -- without dominating the press. Micron is not the largest memory-chip maker in the world, but it has an advantage over sector leadersSK HynixandSamsung(SSNL.F9.01%)right now. The Idaho-based chip maker is first to market with the fourth generation of high bandwidth memory (HBM) -- a key component in the latest and greatest AI accelerator platforms. Samsung and Hynix have their own HBM4 solutions, but Micron is already shipping these chips to its most important customers. AI hardware leaderNvidia(NVDA0.29%)includes Micron's HBM4 memory on its Blackwell family of AI accelerators. Runner-upAMD(AMD0.19%)also selected Micron's top-of-the-line memory for its next two generations of Instinct accelerators. As a result, Micron's market share is growing while Samsung is sliding back. Now, Micron's sales are limited by the company's in-house production capacity, as the HBM chips are sold out for the rest of 2025. That's why Micron has invested $10.2 billion in capital expenses over the last three quarters, up from $5.3 billion in the same year-ago period. These costly chip-factory upgrades will be the foundation of Micron's long-term growth opportunity. So Micron is a leading supplier of AI-grade memory solutions. The stock has gained a market-beating 47% in the first half of 2025. Now you know why. Do you still see IBM as a one-stop shop for corporate computing needs? That would be a mistake. The company refocused on AI,cloud computing, and consulting services long before it was cool. The strategy shift led to many years of disappointing shareholder returns, but the big payoff is finally coming in. And of course, Big Blue's fortunes are built around AI. In the recent first-quarter update, IBM posted an order book of more than $6 billion in the WatsonXgenerative AI service. That's up from roughly $1 billion in the year-ago quarter. That's a big jump. And here's the fun part -- only 20% of this incoming contract portfolio comes from software licenses. The rest springs from consulting services. Image source: Getty Images. This is a unique business advantage. IBM's technical expertise goes far beyond its own software tools. When your company's employees need training on a new technology, or hands-on expertise from IT consultants, you're likely to look at IBM's consulting services. Yes, other tech giants can support their in-house software and services, but they're less likely to offer broad technology support. This isn't a new trend. Before the Fool, two different employers sent me to IBM's training centers around the country to keep me up to date with networking standards and programming tools. That was 20 years ago and nothing has changed -- except IBM's heavier focus on high-value topics such as AI systems and cloud computing. IBM's stock has gained 33% in 2025, and the underlying business results were largely based on consulting services in the AI market. If you knew that five minutes ago, you were already ahead of the game. If not, you just earned an edge on most AI investors.",

        "content": "Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the10 Buzzing AI Stocks on Wall Street Right Now.On July 1, Bernstein raised the firm\u2019s price target on the stock to $235 from $230 and kept an \u201cOutperform\u201d rating on the shares. The modest price target raise follows firm expectations that constraints facing the stock will begin easing throughout the year. As per the firm, AWS growth has decelerated sequentially in Q1 to +17% year-over-year. Meanwhile, AI contribution continued to expand at a triple-digit pace year-over-year from a relatively smaller base vs Azure. The company continues to face supply constrained on chips, motherboards, and other components, similar to their CSP counterparts. This is why, despite strong demand indications, there is a near-term cap on topline growth. The firm is positive that these constraints will ease throughout the year. In particular, a May 15th press release has highlighted more NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs coming online, implying that improvements may already begin in Q2. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

        "content": "July 2 -Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) CEO Lip?Bu Tan is weighing ending marketing of its 18A process tonewfoundry clients and refocusing resources on 14A technology. Tan, who took charge in March, noted that 18A, which was championed by former CEO Pat Gelsinger, has struggled to win new external customers. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with INTC. Under the potential shift, Intel Foundry would accelerate development of its 14A node, where it believes it can better rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE:TSM), and court major clients such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Sources say shelving external sales of 18A and its 18A?P variant could force Intel to take a one?time write?off of several hundred million to potentially over a billion dollars. The board is not expected to decide on the matter until its fall meeting, reflecting the complexity and financial stakes involved. Intel declined to comment on what it described as market speculation, adding that Intel itself remains the primary user of 18A, with Panther Lake processors built on the node slated for production later in 2025. The company will also honor 18A commitments to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) under existing agreements. Investors will be watching whether a pivot to 14A can deliver the performance gains and customer wins Tan is targeting. Based on the one year price targets offered by 32 analysts, the average target price for Intel Corp is $21.20 with a high estimate of $28.30 and a low estimate of $14.00. The average target implies a downside of -7.20% from the current price of $22.85. Based on GuruFocus estimates, the estimated GF Value for Intel Corp in one year is $23.86, suggesting a upside of +4.42% from the current price of $22.85. Gf value is Gurufocus' estimate of the fair value that the stock should be traded at. it is calculated based on the historical multiples the stock has traded at previously, as well as past business growth and the future estimates of the business' performance.

        "content": "TAIPEI,July 2, 2025/PRNewswire/ -- TrendForce reports that major North American CSPs remain the primary drivers of AI server market growth. Steady demand is also being bolstered by tier-2 data centers and sovereign cloud projects in theMiddle EastandEurope. With sustained demand from North American CSPs and OEM customers, global AI server shipments are projected to maintain double-digit growth in 2025. However, geopolitical tensions and US export restrictions impacting the Chinese market have led TrendForce to slightly revise its forecast, projecting a 24.3% YoY increase in global AI server shipments for the year. Microsoft continues to focus investments in AI this year, which has partially suppressed purchases of general-purpose servers. For its AI infrastructure, Microsoft primarily adopts NVIDIA GPU-based solutions, while progress on its in-houseASICdevelopment has been comparatively slow. Its next-generation Maia chips are expected to begin ramping up in 2026. Meta has significantly increased its demand for general-purpose servers in response to the completion of new data centers, with most servers based on AMD platforms. The company is also actively expanding its AI server infrastructure and in-houseASICdevelopment. Shipments volumes for its MTIA chips are expected to double by 2026. Google has seen a notable increase in server demand, driven by sovereign cloud initiatives and the completion of new data centers in SEA. As a company with a relatively high adoption rate of self-developed chips, Google has begun mass deployment of its AI inference-focused TPU v6e chips, which have become mainstream in the first half of 2025. AWS is currently centered on the Trainium v2 platform for its in-house chips. TrendForce notes that AWS has initiated development of multiple versions of Trainium v3, which are slated to begin mass production in 2026. Thanks to its expanding the Trainium platform and accelerated in-house AI strategy, AWS is expected to double its self-developedASICshipments in 2025, leading among US CSPs. Oracle, compared to the other four CSPs, is more focused on purchasing AI servers and in-memory database (IMDB) servers. In 2025, Oracle plans to step up AI server infrastructure deployment and integrate its core cloud database services with AI applications. In response to sovereign cloud projects in the US, the company has also seen increased demand for NVIDIA's GB Rack NVL72 solutions. Additionally, many server enterprise OEMs are reassessing their market strategies for the second half of 2025 due to recent changes in international tariff policies. Currently, TrendForce estimates that total server shipments\u2014including both general-purpose and AI servers\u2014will see a YoY growth of approximately 5%, in line with previous projections.

        "content": "Intel's (INTC)new CEO Lip-Bu Tanis considering a shift away from marketing its 18A chip-manufacturing process, potentially focusing more on an in-development process known as 14A, according toReuters. The shift inIntel's foundry businesswould be an expensive one, likely leading to writing off hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars worth of chipmaking technology as a loss,Reutersreported late Tuesday. A focus on the next-generation 14A process would be part of an effort to win major customers like Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL), as Intel works to catch other chipmakers like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM), who have beat Intel to the manufacturing of smartphone and AI-focused chips, perReuters. Intel did not immediately respond toInvestopedia'srequest for comment. Multiple sources toldReutersthat the 14A process could give Intel advantages over TSMC's processes, which 18A was supposed to do before itfaced delaysand was eventually found to be roughly similar quality as TSMC's N2 method. Intel's board will likely discuss the future of the 18A process at its coming meetings this month and again in the fall,Reutersreported. In addition to weighing its chipmaking options, Intel is bolstering its partnerships. On Monday, the company announced a deal to provide Finnish tech giant Nokia with processors in its newest products. Intel shares, down 1% in premarket trading, entered the day up about 13% since the start of the year, but are still down more than 25% over the last 12 months.",

        "header": "These Are the Must-Watch Stocks, ETFs, and Crypto in the 24-Hour Trading Arena",
        "content": "The launch of 24X National Exchange is likely to alter the nature of financial markets across the U.S. This exchange, which received critical SEC approval in 2024, aims for nearly round-the-clock trading and has inspired long-standing rivals Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to announce plans to expand trading hours as well. Supporters of a 24-hour trading model might highlight its appeal to modern investors accustomed to being connected at all hours of the day. This is particularly true for traders engaged with international stocks that may trade in markets with normal trading hours misaligned with traditional U.S. trading windows. Having continuous trading opportunities around the clock during the week\u2014assome brokers have already started to offer\u2014brings both advantages and some new risks for investors. Traders preparing to adapt to a24-hour cyclewill need to not only learn how to work with systems and platforms that facilitate this trading but also engage with particular stocks,exchange-traded funds(ETFs), cryptocurrencies, and other assets that are likely to see notable activity in this space. Even prior to news about the launch of 24X, there were already systems and platforms helping investors around the world to access U.S. markets during hours beyond the traditional 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Eastern window available on the Nasdaq and the NYSE. One example is the Blue Ocean Alternative Trading Systems platform (BOATS). BOATS has allowed investors to trade U.S. equities between 8:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m. Eastern time five days a week, offeringreal-time price discovery, live quotes, and continuous market access. Extended-hours tradingmay be conducted throughelectronic communication networks (ECNs), which are systems that match buy and sell orders without traditional exchanges. While ECNs offer numerous advantages for investors seeking a smooth trading process outside of the core trading session hours each day, they have limitations as well, includingaccess fees and commissions. A number of brokers are currently offering 24-hour (or nearly 24-hour) trading. These include Charles Schwab, Interactive Brokers, Webull, and others. Not all securities that are traded during typical trading session hours may also be available around the clock. However, many brokerages offer access to financial instruments, including stocks and ETFs, in overnight trading. Stocks, including those found in the S&P 500, theNasdaq 100, and theDow 30, are typically available, as are hundreds of the most popular ETFs. Specialized markets are also available for trading either round-the-clock or on an extended schedule, including cryptocurrencies and forex. One of the main concerns investors have with overnight trading is that volume will be low, potentially meaning that liquidity and spreads will be disadvantageous for retail traders. In an effort to avoid this issue, investors might consider keeping an eye on stocks that typically have high activity and interest during standard trading sessions. These includetech giantslike Nvidia Corp. (NVDA), Apple Inc. (AAPL), and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT). Another key type of company that could appeal to investors looking for 24-hour trading is one that is likely to see significant news break overnight. Certainly, any company with significant overseas business activity would be one to watch\u2014Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) is one example. Finally, some companies are likely to garner round-the-clock investor interest based on their prominence in the U.S. news cycle throughout the day. As of June 2025, companies in the steel industry that are adapting tonews of a major partnership with Japan\u2019s Nippon Steelwould fall into this category. Similarly, data analytics firm Palantir Technologies (PLTR) is a likely candidate as of mid-2025. Investors should be mindful of which firms are generating headlines when they plan to explore 24-hour trading. Some brokerages, like Robinhood, allow investors to place limit orders on whole shares of popular ETFs on a 24/5 schedule from Sunday evening through Friday evening each week.Investors should expect to find many of the most-traded ETFs available in this manner, although specialized and niche funds may not be widely accessible in 24-hour markets. The brokerage Webull offers a range of ETFs for overnight trading, including popular equities ETFs like Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) and bond funds like the Direxion Daily 20+ Year Treasury Bull 3X ETF (TMF). Other ETFs to watch in 24-hour markets include those likely to respond to off-hour breaking news, including cryptocurrency funds like the iShares Ethereum Trust (ETHA) or the ProShares Bitcoin ETF (BITO). Finally, traders with a high risk tolerance may also be interested in watching funds providing leveraged exposure to big-name stocks, including the Direxion Daily TSLA Bull 2X Shares ETF (TSLL), which offers 2X exposure to Tesla (TSLA). Cryptocurrencies can generally be traded 24 hours a day already throughdedicated crypto exchanges. This means that the addition of 24-hour crypto trading to traditional brokerages is not likely to have a significant impact on the cryptocurrency market. Still, there are shifts in liquidity and pricing that may correspond with the time of day. The top crypto assets to watch in 24-hour markets include many of thetop cryptocurrenciesby trading volume and market capitalization. As of June 24, 2025, the leading cryptocurrencies by market value are Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, XRP, and BNB, while the top coins by 24-hour trading volume are Tether, Bitcoin, Dai, Ethereum, and USDC. As with leading stocks above, investors should closely monitor the cryptocurrency space to see whether particular tokens are trending based on recent news or trading activity when they go to watch 24-hour markets. Keep in mind also that traditional brokerages may offer a limited selection of cryptocurrencies compared with dedicated crypto exchanges that already offer round-the-clock transactions. The best broker for an individual investor will depend on a number of factors, but popular brokers for 24-hour trading include Charles Schwab, Robinhood, Interactive Brokers, and Webull. Some of the risks of 24-hour trading include lower liquidity and wider price fluctuations during less active periods. Twenty-four-hour trading provides investors the opportunity to trade in response to breaking news. It also allows investors outside of the U.S. to access the space at times that may be more convenient for non-local traders. Twenty-four-hour trading may also help to minimize price gaps that occur between core trading sessions. Retail investors should be aware that extended-hours trading is often dominated by institutional investors, posing additional risks to individuals. Still, the advent of 24-hour trading may shift this dynamic. Investors with an atypical schedule who may prefer to transact overnight and those interested in accessing the U.S. market from other parts of the world are both likely to benefit from this new trading schedule. Twenty-four-hour trading is likely to impact each portfolio differently. Investors may be more inclined to trade more frequently if they have access to trading around the clock, which can actually eat away at a portfolio due to transaction fees. There is a tangible shift toward expansive trading hours taking place in U.S. markets. New exchanges like 24X aim for nearly round-the-clock trading during the week, prompting legacy exchanges like the Nasdaq and the NYSE to increase trading hours as well. The result is that many investors will now need to adapt to a new schedule and the novel risks and opportunities it carries. Investors interested in exploring 24-hour trading might look to some of the most popular stocks, ETFs, and cryptocurrencies as a place to start, as these may be more likely to experience sustained liquidity and minimal price disruptions at all hours of the day.",

        "content": "For investors, the first half of 2025 was a rollercoaster ride that ended happily. Market watchers think the rest of the year could look much the same. Stocks underwent one of theirworst sell-offs in decadesafter President Donald Trump announced his \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs on April 2. That was followed a week later by one of theirbest days in decadeswhen Trump paused those tariffs. In the end, the S&P 500 rose more than 10% over the second quarter, finishing the first half of the yearat a record high. The rebound was aided by easing economic uncertainty. A preliminary trade deal with the U.K. andde-escalation with Chinaboosted optimism that tariff rateswill ultimately settlebelow their \"Liberation Day\" levels. Despite mounting fears of a growth slowdown and resurgent inflation, data throughout the second quarter suggested the labor marketwas resilientand tariffs were having onlya modest impacton inflation. Taken together, investors now see reasons to hope that the Federal Reserve will resume interest rate cuts in the second half, which could further lift shares. Several banks havelifted their year-end S&P 500 targetsin recent weeks, with many restoring estimates they slashed after \"Liberation Day.\" The path ahead for stocks could turn largely on questions about trade. The clock is tickingfor the White House to strike bilateral trade deals by July 9, when the 90-day tariff pause ends. Trump has hinted he\u2019s open to extending the deadline, which could keep businesses and Wall Street in an uncertain position for some time. \"I expect stock markets to be noisy in the coming months, because many companies are frozen in place until they have more clarity on where global trade is headed,\" said Cheryl Frank, portfolio manager at Capital Group. Still, Frank said, noise and headline-driven volatility, like April's tariff rout, can create buying opportunities. \"In periods of disruption, markets have tended to punish good companies as well as bad,\" she said. \"A lot of companies will appear to be on sale.\" Historically high valuations may keep a lid on the S&P 500's gains in the second half, according to some market watchers. The S&P 500\u2019sprice-to-earnings ratiorebounded sharply off April\u2019s lows and was recently near a cycle high. At the same time, earnings estimates have declined this year, though only to a degree that reflects expectations for a moderate slowdown. \u201c\u200b\u200bThis tells me that markets are no longer priced for an adverse outcome,\u201d wrote Jurrien Timmer, director of global macro at Fidelity\u2019s Global Asset Allocation Division. \u201cThis matters, because the sunnier the market\u2019s expectations, the harder it is to beat them.\u201d Higher valuations for stocks \"will remain a psychological hurdle for some investors,\u201d which could limit the market\u2019s upside potential, wrote JPMorgan analysts Dubravko Lakos-Bujas and Bhupinder Singh in a recent research note. High valuations themselves are rarely a reason stocks decline, say Lakos-Bujas and Singh; instead, they wrote, they set prices up to fall faster and further when things go awry. If stocks slip in the coming months, it will most likely be because the economy slows, according to Lakos-Bujas and Singh.Hard datalike employment and consumer spending could deteriorate as the effects of tariffs, immigration crackdowns, and federal spending cuts take their toll. U.S. stocks have had a strong start to the year. International ones have done even better. Where's an investor to turn? The MSCI World ex. USA Index, which tracks large and mid-cap stocks in 22 non-American developed markets, more than tripled the S&P 500\u2019s 5.5% return through June. Yet despite their outperformance, international stocks remain inexpensive ona price-to-earnings basiscompared to their U.S. counterparts. \u201cAttractive valuations may persuade investors to reallocate money away from the U.S. in their portfolios,\u201d according to strategists at Charles Schwab.That could sap the U.S. market of some upside potential. Global stocks may also be helped by recent policy changes. Trump\u2019s insistence that allies rely less on U.S. security guarantees has led most European countries to boost defense and infrastructure spending. Japan late last year approved a 9% increase in defense spending. \u201cThis move should spur more economic activity in those regions and potentially narrow the gap in global growth,\u201d possibly drawing more interest from domestic and international investors, said Bernstein analysts. TheMagnificent Sevenstocks had a rough start to the year. They were first hammered by concerns aboutoverspending on AI infrastructureand then by tariff fears. The Bloomberg Magnificent 7 Total Return Index inched up just 0.3% this year through June, while only three of the seven stocks finished the first half in the green. However, market watchers remain bullish on Big Tech, whose healthy balance sheets and cash flows should help them weather extreme uncertainty. \u201cWe are Overweight Tech on the back of tariff de-escalation, along with the Big Beautiful Bill\u2019s support for investment spending and high-end consumption,\u201d wrote JPMorgan analysts. Within Tech, the firm favors semiconductors, the Mag 7, and stocks tied to AI themes, including data center buildouts, power providers, and cybersecurity. There\u2019s room for retail investors to up their exposure to the Mag 7, according to Charles Schwab analysts Liz Ann Sonders and Kevin Gordon. The group\u2019s share of retail investor inflows hasdeclined to multi-year lowsthis year, according to Sonders and Gordon's assessment of data from Vanda Research. \u201cIt doesn't suggest the mega caps are under-owned entirely,\" they said. \"But we wouldn't be surprised to see them make an attempt at reasserting their dominance in the second half.\"",

The shift would lead Intel to change what manufacturing processIntel's foundry businessfocuses on selling to new customers. The change would be expensive, likely leading to writing off hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars worth of chipmaking technology used to develop the so-called \"18A\" manufacturing process as a loss,Reutersreported late Tuesday. A focus on the next-generation \"14A\" process would be part of an effort to win major customers like Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL), as Intel works to catch other chipmakers like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM), who have beat Intel to the manufacturing of smartphone and AI-focused chips, perReuters. Intel did not immediately respond toInvestopedia'srequest for comment. Multiple sources toldReutersthat the 14A process could give Intel advantages over TSMC's processes, which 18A was supposed to do before itfaced delaysand was eventually found to be roughly similar quality as TSMC's N3 method. Intel's board will likely discuss the future of the 18A process at its coming meetings this month and again in the fall,Reutersreported. In addition to weighing its chip-making options, Intel is bolstering its partnerships. On Monday, the company announced a deal to provide Finnish tech giant Nokia with processors in its newest products. Intel shares, down 5% shortly after markets opened, are up about 8% since the start of the year, but are still down more than 25% over the last 12 months.

        "content": "Like many high-growth stocks,Nvidia(NVDA2.62%)shares looked expensive on a fundamental basis over the last three years, even as its price shot higher by almost 980%. Now, some investors likely feel they've missed out because shares trade at what would be considered a relatively high price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. However, there's an argument to be made that Nvidia is still an inexpensive stock. Here's a look at both sides of the discussion, including one chart that really tells the story that investors should focus on. Image source: Getty Images. Even with the stock's resounding three-year gain, its valuation has decreased when looking atprice-to-free cash flow(P/FCF) and P/E ratios. That makes sense with sales exploding thanks to unprecedented demand for itsGPU chipsand other products supporting artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure. Both of those financial metrics hit one-year lows as recently as early April. The stock has surged higher since then, but both P/FCF and trailing P/E remain below their respective averages over the past 12 months. A P/E of almost 50 based on last year's earnings still may seem excessively high to some, but investors need to look forward, not back. An estimated forward P/E of about 35 is much more reasonable fora growth stocklike Nvidia. And growth is what is driving the story. Ongoing global data center construction is driving unprecedented demand for Nvidia products. Clusters of servers containing its GPUs, networking products, and AI architecture power these centers. That's led to rocketing sales in Nvidia's data center segment. A visual display of that growth is what should give investors confidence to buy the stock at recent levels. Data source: Nvidia. Chart by author. Nvidia's data center sales continue to increase to record levels every quarterly period. The company plans to release next-generation chips on an annual cadence as well. That should keep sales thriving and the stock moving higher as a result.",

Markets thrashed on news the U.S. had reached a trade deal with Vietnam and that the private sector lost 33,000 jobs in June. Markets on Wednesday continued their rocky but unmistakably upward trajectory. The S&P 500 rose 0.5% and hit a new intraday high of 6,224.61; tech giants likeNvidiaandTeslahad strong sessions aftersinking the day before; and theNasdaqticked up 0.9%. TheDowJones had a choppy day, sinking in the morning, shooting up 0.5% shortly before noon, and ultimately closing the day down 11 points. Several Magnificent Seven companies rebounded. Nvidia rose 2.6% andApplewas up 2.2%. Tesla shares climbed 5% on reports that apoor sales quarterwas not as bad as expected. Markets also welcomed news the U.S. had agreed to a framework for a trade deal with Vietnam. The outlines of the deal includes a 20% tariff on all imports from Vietnam. In exchange, Vietnam will roll back trade barriers on American goods, President Donald Trump announced in a social-media post. \u201cWe will be able to sell our product into Vietnam at ZERO Tariff,\u201d Trump wrote. Apparel stocks jumped on the news.GapInc, Lululemon, andNikeall shot up immediately once the deal became public. All three companies have major manufacturing operations in Vietnam. In the minutes after the announcement, Gap rose 2.4% and Lululemon 2.8%. Both then dropped precipitously before evening out in the session\u2019s later hours. At market close, Gap and Lululemon shares were up both up 0.5%. However, Nike had a similar up-and-down in the span of minutes before recovering much faster. Nike shares closed 4.1%. Across the markets, the reaction to the Vietnam trade deal was somewhat muted after an abysmal private-employment report. ADP\u2019s June print of theprivate sector said it lost 33,000 jobsthat month, when analysts had expected an increase of 100,000. That said, ADP numbers have not always been reliable indicators of what the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 monthly reports will show. Investors will still be wondering whether June\u2019s private-sector job losses may be an initial sign of weakness in the labor market. A slackening in the labor market was expected as analysts lowered growth estimates for the year. \u201cWe expect the unemployment rate to edge higher in the second half of 2025 as the labor market softens in response to slower growth, with the full force of tariffs working through the economy,\u201d wrote Oxford Economics\u2019 lead U.S. economist Nancy Vanden Houten in a Wednesday note. The next BLS report will influence the Fed\u2019s rate decisions at its upcoming July meeting, especially if it proves to be as disappointing as Wednesday\u2019s. Although contrary to what might be expected, investors seem to be brushing off the lackluster jobs report precisely because it might induce the Fed to resume cutting rates. \u201cIndeed, this morning\u2019s huge miss on ADP jobs is not worrying anyone about the health of the cycle,\u201d said Interactive Brokers senior economist Jos\u00e9 Torres. \u201cIt appears to be just the opposite, with participants excited that the Fed may assume an increasingly dovish posture in order to defend the labor market.\u201d This story was originally featured onFortune.com",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- OpenAI has agreed to rent a massive amount of computing power from Oracle Corp. data centers as part of its Stargate initiative, underscoring the intense requirements for cutting-edge artificial intelligence products. The AI company will rent additional capacity from Oracle totaling about 4.5 gigawatts of data center power in the US, according to people familiar with the work who asked not to be named discussing private information. That is an unprecedented sum of energy that could power millions of American homes. A gigawatt is akin to the capacity from one nuclear reactor and can provide electricity to roughly 750,000 houses. Earlier this week, Oracle announced that it had signed a single cloud deal worth $30 billion in annual revenue beginning in fiscal 2028 without naming the customer. This Stargate agreement makes up at least part of that disclosed contract, according to one of the people. Stargate \u2014 OpenAI\u2019s project with partners including Oracle and SoftBank Group Corp. to invest $500 billion in AI infrastructure \u2014 was first announced in January at the White House. So far, Oracle has developed a massive data center in Abilene, Texas, for OpenAI alongside development partner Crusoe. To meet the additional demand from OpenAI, Oracle will develop multiple data centers across the US with partners, the people said. Sites in states including Texas, Michigan, Wisconsin and Wyoming are under consideration, in addition to expanding the Abilene site from a current power capacity of 1.2 gigawatts to about 2 gigawatts, they said. OpenAI is also considering sites in New Mexico, Georgia, Ohio and Pennsylvania, one of the people said. These new projects will be part of Stargate, and details of the plans may still change, according to a person familiar with the plans. OpenAI and Crusoe declined to comment on the plans. Oracle didn\u2019t return a request for comment. Oracle shares climbed following the news and closed up 5% to $229.98, a record high. The stock has jumped 38% this year, fueled by investor enthusiasm for its cloud business. Oracle, known for its database software, has gained traction in the market for renting out computing power and storage over the internet, in part by targeting clients focused on AI work. This has led to a jump in revenue and expenses. The $30 billion deal is more than the current size of its entire cloud infrastructure business. Credit ratings firm S&P wrote Wednesday that Oracle\u2019s cloud infrastructure building spree was straining cash flow and that the current spending pace is higher than anticipated. Still, it viewed Oracle\u2019s cloud strategy favorably over the long term. OpenAI said in May it was helping develop a Stargate project in the United Arab Emirates with Oracle, Crusoe, AI chipmaker Nvidia Corp, Cisco Systems Inc. and G42, an AI company backed by the country\u2019s sovereign wealth fund. --With assistance from Josh Saul, Min Jeong Lee and Naureen S.

        "content": "Shares ofArm Holdings(ARM-1.09%)shot up last month on a broader bullish trend in the semiconductor industry that lifted peers likeNvidiaandAMDas concerns around tariffs and a potential recession simmered down, and the risk-on artificial intelligence (AI) trade returned. There was no single news item that drove Arm stock higher, but several events combined to send the stock up 30% by the end of the month, according to data fromS&P Global Market Intelligence. As you can see from the chart below, the stock marched steadily higher over the course of the month, easily outperforming theS&P 500.  ARMdata byYCharts There was relatively little company-specific news out on Arm last month, but the company, which is best known for power-efficient CPU architecture, is a close partner of tech giants likeAppleand Nvidia, giving it a broad range of exposure across the tech industry. The company, which licenses its architecture to those partners, is also sensitive to the economic cycle, which can drive demand. So it responded favorably to signs that the U.S. economy remained resilient, according to data, even with new tariffs in place. In fact, one of Arm's best days last month came from Apple's World Wide Developer Conference (WWDC), where Apple announced a number of new features to its iOS software and Apple Intelligence. Apple is a major customer for Arm, and the news was enough to drive Apple stock up 4.1% on the day on its second-highest trading volume day of the month. After Arm stock dipped briefly, it surged over the last full week of June in line with broader market gains as Mideast tension tamped down, and inflation remained modest through May, showing that tariffs had not yet had a meaningful impact on prices. Arm closed out the month receiving a bullish note from Guggenheim, which maintained a buy rating on the stock and raised its price target from $147 to $187. Image source: Getty Images. Arm stock has fallen over the first two days of July as the valuation is arguably stretched following last week's gains. The company's competitive advantages are formidable due to its technological edge in power efficiency, but significant growth is already baked into the stock as it trades at aprice-to-sales ratioof 41. While the business looks like a good bet to continue growing, investors may want to wait for a more attractive price point before buying the stock.",
