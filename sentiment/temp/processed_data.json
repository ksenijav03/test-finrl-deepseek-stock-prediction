        "content": "Intel (INTC) shares soared on Tuesday,pacing gains on the S&P 500, as chip stocks rallied amid hopes that curbs on exports to China could be eased. Thegains for chip stocks\u2014the PHLX Semiconductor Index has risen 2% in each of the past two sessions\u2014come as theU.S. and China hold trade talksthis week in London, where officials are reportedly discussing restrictions on exports of various products, including rare earth minerals and chips. Intel shares gained nearly 8% on Tuesday, closing at just above $22. The stock is up about 10% so far in 2025, outpacing the gains of the S&P 500, but has lost nearly 30% of its value over the past 12 months amiduncertainty over the chipmaker\u2019s strategic directionand inability to capitalize on the booming AI chip market. CEO Lip-Bu Tan, whotook over the top spot in mid-March, has launched a major restructuring effort. Below, we take a closer look at Intel\u2019s price and usetechnical analysisto identify crucial price levels that investors will likely be watching. Intel shares have remainedrangeboundsince gapping sharply lower last August. More recently, the stock found buying interest around the lower levels of thetrading range, with the price closing above both the 50- and 200-day moving averages on Tuesday. Importantly, the move higher occurred on the highest dailyvolumesince early April, indicating buying conviction from larger market participants. Moreover, the rally thrust therelative strength indexback above its neutral threshold to signal accelerating price momentum. Let\u2019s identify three crucial overhead areas to watch if the stock continues to trend higher and also locate a majorsupport levelworth monitoring duringpullbacks. It\u2019s initially worth watching the $23 level. This area on the chart may attract selling interest near last month\u2019sswing highduring an attempt to reclaim the 200-day MA. Buying above this level could see the shares rally toward $26. Tactical traders who employ rangebound strategies may seekexit pointsin this area near three prominentpeaksthat formed on the chart between November and March, a location that also marks the top of the stock\u2019s multi-month trading range. A convincingbreakoutabove the trading range could trigger a rapid move to the $33 level. We projected this target by using themeasuring principle, a technique that analyzeschart patternsto forecast future price movements. When applying the analysis to Intel\u2019s chart, we calculate the distance of the trading range inpointsand add that amount to its top trendline. For example, we add $7 to $26, which projects a target of $33, nearly 50% above Tuesday\u2019s closing price. During pullbacks in the stock, investors should closely monitor the $19 level. Intel shares would likely attract significant support in this location near the trading range\u2019s lower trendline.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Some investors are questioning the amount of cash Big Tech is throwing at artificial intelligence, fueling concerns for profit margins and the risk that depreciation expenses will drag stocks down before companies can see investments pay off. Most Read from Bloomberg Trump\u2019s Military Parade Has Washington Bracing for Tanks and Weaponry NY Long Island Rail Service Resumes After Grand Central Fire NYC Mayoral Candidates All Agree on Building More Housing. But Where? Senator Calls for Closing Troubled ICE Detention Facility in New Mexico NJ\u2019s Sherrill, Ciattarelli Win Primaries in Governor\u2019s Race \u201cOn a cash flow basis they\u2019ve all stagnated because they\u2019re all collectively making massive bets on the future with all their capital,\u201d said Jim Morrow, founder and chief executive officer at Callodine Capital Management. \u201cWe focus a lot on balance sheets and cash flows, and so for us they have lost their historical attractive cash flow dynamics. They\u2019re just not there anymore.\u201d Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Microsoft Corp. are projected to spend $311 billion on capital expenses in their current fiscal years and $337 billion in 2026, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That includes a more than 60% increase during the first quarter from the same period a year ago. Free cash flow, meanwhile, tumbled 23% in the same period. \u201cThere is a tsunami of depreciation coming,\u201d said Morrow, who is steering clear of the stocks because he sees profits deteriorating without a corresponding jump in revenue. Much of the money is going toward things like semiconductors, servers and networking equipment that are critical for artificial intelligence computing. However, this gear loses its value much faster than other depreciating assets like real estate. Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta posted combined depreciation expenses of $15.6 billion in the first quarter, up from $11.4 billion a year ago. Add in Amazon, which has pumped more of its cash into capital spending in lieu of buybacks or dividends, and the number nearly doubles. \u201cPeople thought AI would be a monetization machine early on, but that hasn\u2019t been the case,\u201d said Rob Almeida, global investment strategist at MFS Investment Management. \u201cThere\u2019s not as fast of AI uptake as people thought.\u201d AI Bounce Of course, investors still have a hearty appetite for the technology giants given their dominant market positions, strong balance sheets and profit growth that, while slowing, is still beating the rest of the S&P 500. This explains the strong performance of AI stocks recently. Since April 9, the day President Donald Trump paused his global tariffs and turned a stock market swoon into a boom, the biggest AI exchange-traded fund, the Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF, is up 34%, while AI chipmaker Nvidia Corp. has soared 49%. Meta has gained 38%, and Microsoft has climbed 33% \u2014 all topping the S&P 500\u2019s 21% jump and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index\u2019s 28% bounce. Just Tuesday, Bloomberg News reported that Meta leader Mark Zuckerberg is recruiting a secretive AI brain trust of researchers and engineers to help the company achieve \u201cartificial general intelligence,\u201d meaning creating a machine that can perform as well as humans at many tasks. It\u2019s a monumental undertaking that will require a vast investment of capital. And in response Meta shares reversed Monday\u2019s decline and rose 1.2%. But with more and more depreciating assets being loaded on the balance sheet, the drag on the bottom line will put increased pressure on the companies to show bigger returns on the investments. Dealing With Depreciation This is why depreciation was a frequent theme in first-quarter earnings calls. Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Anat Ashkenazi warned that the expenses would rise throughout the year, and said management is trying to offset the non-cash costs by streamlining its businesses. \u201cWe\u2019re focusing on continuing to moderate the pace of compensation growth, looking at our real estate footprint, and again, the build-out and utilization of our technical infrastructure across the business,\u201d she said on Alphabet\u2019s April 24 earnings call. Other companies are taking similar steps. Earlier this year, Meta Platforms extended the useful life period of certain servers and networking assets to five and a half years, from the four-to-five years it previously used. The change resulted in a roughly $695 million increase in net income, or 27 cents a share, in the first quarter, Meta said in a filing. Microsoft did the same in 2022, increasing the useful lives of server and networking equipment to six years from four. When executives were asked on the company\u2019s April 30 earnings call about whether increased efficiency might result in another extension, Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said such changes hinge more on software than hardware. \u201cWe like to have a long history before we make any of those changes,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re focused on getting every bit of useful life we can, of course, out of assets.\u201d Amazon, however, has taken the opposite approach. In February, the e-commerce and cloud computing company said the lifespan of similar equipment is growing shorter rather than longer and reduced useful life to five years from six. To Callodine\u2019s Morrow, the big risk is what happens if AI investments don\u2019t lead to a dramatic growth in revenue and profitability. That kind of market shock occurred in 2022, when a contraction in profits and rising interest rates sent technology stocks plummeting and dragged the S&P 500 lower. \u201cIf it works out it will be fine,\u201d said Morrow. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t work out there\u2019s a big earnings headwind coming.\u201d Top Tech Stories Nintendo Co. sold 3.5 million-plus units of the Switch 2 in just four days, a record-breaking start for the company\u2019s first new console in eight years. Snap Inc. plans to launch its first consumer pair of augmented-reality glasses next year, beating a planned release from rival Meta Platforms Inc. by several months. After years of anticipation and broken promises, Tesla Inc. said its robotaxi service is tentatively set to roll out later this month. Options traders aren\u2019t ready to buy the hype yet. Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s chief security officer joined officials at other major tech companies in calling for fewer regulations in artificial intelligence, warning that government involvement in this rapidly emerging area risks narrowing the scope of the company\u2019s work.

        "content": "Leading Global Pharma Joins Danish Enterprises, Startups and Public Health Systems Using AI Factories to Improve Drug Discovery and Healthcare Novo Nordisk / DCAI PARIS, June 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --NVIDIA GTC Paris at VivaTech\u2014NVIDIA today announced a collaboration with Novo Nordisk to accelerate drug discovery efforts through innovative AI use cases. The work supports Novo Nordisk\u2019s agreement withDCAIto use the Gefion sovereign AI supercomputer. The companies aim to create customized AI models and agents that Novo Nordisk can use for early research and clinical development and to apply advanced simulation andphysical AItechnologies. \u201cAI is essential for every industry, and there\u2019s no other field that will benefit more from acceleration than drug discovery,\u201d said Rory Kelleher, senior director of business development for life sciences at NVIDIA. \u201cWorking with Novo Nordisk, we\u2019re advancing critical R&D applications with fundamental tools that can harness the full potential of generative and agentic AI to improve pharmaceutical development.\u201d Novo Nordisk Taps Advanced AI to Accelerate InnovationDCAI\u2019s Gefion supercomputer, powered byNVIDIA DGX SuperPOD\u2122, provides Novo Nordisk anAI factoryfor running drug discovery and agentic AI workloads. Novo Nordisk will useNVIDIA BioNeMo\u2122 for generative AI-powered drug discovery,NVIDIA NIM\u2122 andNVIDIA NeMo\u2122 microservices for building customized agentic workflows, and theNVIDIA Omniverse\u2122 platform to create physically accurate simulation environments for developing physical AI applications. Novo Nordisk researchers will focus on several AI research programs, including using single-cell models to predict cellular responses to drug candidates and structures, as well as designing models to build molecules with drug-like properties. The companies will also collaborate on tapping Novo Nordisk\u2019s vast global scientific literature to build biomedical large language models, enabling researchers to uncover correlations between genes, proteins and diseases. \u201cBy coupling NVIDIA\u2019s accelerated computing platform and expertise with Novo\u2019s deep expertise in life sciences research and development, we aim to build custom models that will aid our scientists in developing new medicines faster and more efficiently,\u201d said Mishal Patel, senior vice president, AI and digital innovation at Novo Nordisk. \u201cGefion will allow us to run experiments at an unprecedented scale.\u201d Advancing Denmark\u2019s Healthcare EcosystemDCAI owns and operates Gefion, Denmark\u2019s flagship AI supercomputer. DCAI is helping lower the barrier for accessing advanced computing capabilities and enabling companies in Denmark to pursue research and development across healthcare and drug discovery. \u201cWith Gefion\u2019s computational power, we can tackle the toughest R&D challenges, with the ultimate goal of unlocking new possibilities for pharmaceutical research and development,\u201d said Nadia Carlsten, CEO of DCAI. \u201cBy combining Gefion\u2019s capabilities with NVIDIA\u2019s expertise, our customers can accelerate innovation even further.\u201d Gefion has already been used by multiple customers to advance healthcare and drug discovery. Teton, a Danish startup and member of theNVIDIA Inceptionprogram for cutting-edge startups, is tapping into Gefion to accelerate the development of its AI care companion for hospitals, using cameras and sensors installed in patient rooms to create real-time 3Ddigital twins. This allows nurses to monitor patients remotely and receive alerts about potential health issues. Teton\u2019s technology aims to reduce workload burden on nurses \u2014 freeing them up for higher-value tasks \u2014 and improve patient care, with early trials showing up to a 25% reduction in nightshift duties. Last month, DCAI announced that one of the first pharma companies to use Gefion will tap the supercomputer to accelerate drug discovery and development in neurological and psychiatric disorders. Another venture-backed company is using Gefion to accelerate the development of oral alternatives to widely used biologics and to target proteins that are currently difficult or impossible to drug with available compounds. Gefion will also be used as part of an effort by Danish health organizations to unite previously siloed health data into a single national analysis platform, which will provide researchers with secure access to interconnected health data. Along with supercomputing resources, this will make it easier to analyze large datasets, identify disease patterns earlier and develop more personalized treatments.

        "content": "Investing.com -- Shares of several quantum computing companies have risen premarket on Wednesday after Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang reiterated that quantum technology is at an \"inflection point.\" Huang\u2019s comments, made at the VivaTech conference in Paris, have ignited optimism across the sector. Quantum Computing Inc. has risen 7.3%, followed by IonQ up 3.55%. D-Wave Quantum increased by 1.6%, Arqit Quantum by 2.7%, and Rigetti Computing climbed 3.9%. Huang emphasised that quantum calculations hold the potential to solve problems that would currently demand years of processing from even Nvidia\u2019s most advanced AI systems. He stated that quantum computing will tackle \"some interesting problems\" in the coming years. The Nvidia chief\u2019s remarks echo similar sentiments he expressed in March at Nvidia\u2019s annual software developer conference. In March, he also announced a new quantum computing research lab in Boston in collaboration with Harvard and MIT scientists. The comments marked a shift from his January comments, where he had suggested useful quantum computers were still two decades away, now signalling a much closer horizon for practical applications.

        "header": "Prediction: Nvidia Stock Will Get a Boost From an Increase in Acquisition Activity",
        "content": "Nvidia(NVDA0.86%), which dominates theartificial intelligence(AI) chip and related technology space, seems poised to increase its acquisition activity in the near-term to medium-term. Nvidia has proven very savvy in making prior acquisitions. Notably, its largest acquisition ever -- its $6.9 billion purchase of high-performance networking specialist Mellanox Technologies in 2020 -- has proven to be a huge winner. So, investors should be able to count on future acquisitions also being shrewd and helping to boost Nvidia's profit growth and, hence, its stock price.  Image source: Getty Images. Two main reasons for my prediction are statements that CFO Colette Kress made last December and my periodic reviews of Nvidia's job ads, which suggest the company is beefing up its mergers and acquisitions (M&A) capabilities. Moreover, it just makes sense that the company will ramp up its acquisition activity because it has a ton of cash. Sure, it's generating interest income, but some of that cash should be able to be put to better use. In addition, Nvidia's top management team and its board of directors know that smart acquisitions can help drive profit growth, which should drive stock price growth. And these folks surely want the stock's good times to continue as they all have very sizable to massive wealth tied to Nvidia stock. For instance, CEO Jensen Huang, longtime board member Cox Tench, and CFO Kress's Nvidia stock holdings were worth more than $122 billion, $3.5 billion, and $792 million, respectively, as of the market close on Monday, June 9. \"We can also think about that in terms of our work, of bringing on great teams in some M&A [merger and acquisition] form... That is a great opportunity for us to do,\"Tom's Hardwarereported Kress as saying at the UBS Global Technology and AI Conference in December. About a month ago, I came across the following Nvidia human resources (HR) job opening: We are now looking for a M&A and integration activities lead for HR. In this role you will partner closely with the corporate M&A team from due diligence to post-close integration and work closely with all HR organizations globally as well as company functional leaders to ensure a strong target company assessment and develop integration strategy! Last week, I came across an M&A-related accounting job opening that was posted in late May: This is an outstanding chance to be part of NVIDIA's finance team, contributing significantly to our growth strategy. We are looking for a Senior Manager, M&A Accounting to evaluate complex and high-impact M&A transactions, ensuring proper accounting, financial integration, and achieving efficient accounting and finance outcomes for our organization. I periodically review Nvidia's job postings, as it's a great way to gain insight into the company's direction and strategies. And I've not seen two M&A-related job postings within such a brief period before. In fact, I can't even recall seeing one such opening. Sure, it's possible these openings could be to replace employees who have left Nvidia, but I tend to think that at least one of them, if not both, is for an entirely new position. Nvidia has extremely low turnover.  Data by YCharts. Nvidia has a mighty balance sheet with about $52.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents and only $8.5 billion in long-term debt. Moreover, the company generates a ton of free cash flow (FCF). Over its last four reported quarters, it's generated about $72 billion in FCF, with last quarter generating more than $26 billion. Nvidia's combined balance sheet and FCF generation is superior to three of its major competitors,Advanced Micro Devices(AMD0.80%),Intel(INTC-2.90%), andBroadcom(AVGO-0.25%). This gives Nvidia a competitive advantage in several ways, including in the acquisition realm.  Data by YCharts. AMD has a solid balance sheet, though its cash position is much less than Nvidia's. Intel not only has a large long-term debt load relative to its cash position, its negative FCF means that it's burning through cash. Broadcom generates strong cash flows for its size, but it has a large long-term debt load relative to its cash position, so it's using a good amount of cash to service its debt. How do these companies compete with Nvidia? AMD and Intel also make discrete graphics processing units (GPUs) for processing AI workloads in data centers. Nvidia had a 92% share of this market in 2024, according to market research firm IoT Analytics. Moreover, AMD competes with Nvidia in the gaming GPU market. Broadcomcompetes with Nvidia in the data center networking space. It also makes application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), which are custom chips, for several hyperscalers (companies that operate huge data centers). For some use cases, these chips are being used instead of GPUs. In short, Nvidia seems poised to increase its acquisition activity to help it continue to grow at a robust pace. The company has proven very skilled at making acquisitions, and there's no reason to believe its great track record won't continue.",

        "content": "By Stephen Nellis SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -Nvidia and artificial intelligence search firm Perplexity on Wednesday said they are partnering with more than a dozen AI firms in Europe and the Middle East to refine those firms' AI technologies and distribute them to local businesses. Nvidia said it will work with model makers in France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain and Sweden to help make AI models in local languages become what are called reasoning models, which are capable of carrying out more complicated tasks. AI technologies built in English and Chinese have started to shift to that technology, but that transition is more difficult in languages where less training data is available. Kari Briski, vice president of generative AI software for enterprise at Nvidia, said the company will help model makers generate new data - known as synthetic data - in local languages to help improve them. \"We're doing a lot of synthetic data generation to bring to these low-resource languages and translating our reasoning data so that they can train on it,\" Briski said in an interview Tuesday. \"Europe needs strong models that reflect each nation's unique language and culture.\" Once those local models are trained, Perplexity will help distribute them in Europe, where businesses can run them in local data centers and use them to carry out business tasks such as researching a new topic. Perplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas said Germany is already Perplexity's second largest market by revenue. \"That's the kind of system we are heading to in the future, where models are basically doing a few hours' worth of work in one single prompt,\" Srinivas said. The deal was part of a number of announcements Nvidia made at an AI conference in Paris on Wednesday. Nvidia and Perplexity did not disclose any financial terms of the deal.

        "content": "Chicago, IL \u2013 June 11, 2025\u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights NVIDIA NVDA, Innodata INOD and Broadcom AVGO. The AI trade has jumped back into favor over recent weeks following some strong quarterly releases, with AI favorites such asNVIDIA,InnodataandBroadcomall seeing big gains. For those interested in momentum, let's take a closer look at each. NVIDIA Remains Stellar We've all been accustomed to NVIDIA's recent story, with its historical growth fueled by unrelenting demand for its Data Center products. The tech titan continued to fire on all cylinders throughout its latest release concerning its Data Center, with sales of $39.1 billion up 73% from the $22.5 billion print in the same period last year. As shown below, NVDA's Data Center results have regularly blown away our consensus Data Center expectations over recent periods. CEO Jensen Huang again provided a bullish statement in the latest release, stating \u2013 \"Global demand for NVIDIA's AI infrastructure is incredibly strong. AI inference token generation has surged tenfold in just one year, and as AI agents become mainstream, the demand for AI computing will accelerate. Countries around the world are recognizing AI as essential infrastructure \u2014 just like electricity and the internet \u2014 and NVIDIA stands at the center of this profound transformation.\" The stock overall still reflects one of the strongest AI plays out there, with shares also not overly expensive. Shares currently trade at a 30.1X forward 12-month earnings multiple, a fraction of the 106.3X five-year highs and well beneath the 50.0X five-year median. The current PEG ratio works out to a fair 1.1X, again well beneath five-year highs and the five-year median. Innodata Sees Triple-Digit Growth Innodata is a global data engineering company that provides a range of transferable solutions, platforms, and services for Generative AI / AI builders and adopters. Like those above, Innodata has been enjoying supercharged growth, with sales of $58.3 million throughout its latest period climbing 120% year-over-year. Importantly, the company reiterated its FY25 revenue growth guidance of 40% or more, a critical announcement given the all-around uncertainty lingering stemming from tariffs. Many companies were unable to provide or reaffirm guidance outlooks throughout the Q1 cycle, but Innodata cleared the crucial hurdle. Analysts have maintained their bullish sales outlooks following the release, with the $242 million in sales expected for its FY25 up more than 50% over the last year. Broadcom Reports Record Sales Broadcom is evolving a broad portfolio of technologies to extend its leadership in enabling next-generation AI infrastructure. This includes foundational technologies and advanced packaging capabilities aimed at building the highest performance, lowest power custom AI accelerators. The stock currently sports a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), with its earnings outlook inching higher across several timeframes over recent months thanks to strong quarterly results. Concerning its latest quarterly release just last week, AI revenue of $4.4 billion moved 46% higher year-over-year. The quarter's results were driven by robust demand for its AI solutions, with the company forecasting AI semiconductor revenue of $5.1 billion for its Q3. Notably, AVGO posted a record $15.0 billion in sales, which grew a strong 20% year-over-year. Its cash-generating abilities also saw a nice boost, with free cash flow of $6.4 billion also reflecting a record and climbing 44% year-over-year. The AI trade has jumped back into favor recently, with all three companies above seeing big gains over the past month. All three companies posted strong results in their latest quarterly releases, with the positivity driven by red-hot demand stemming from the AI frenzy. For those seeking momentum paired with AI exposure, all three provide precisely that. Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

        "content": "(Bloomberg) \u2014 Nvidia Corp. Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang projected that Europe\u2019s artificial-intelligence computing capacity will increase by a factor of ten over the next two years, with more than 20 so-called AI factories in the works. Most Read from Bloomberg Trump\u2019s Military Parade Has Washington Bracing for Tanks and Weaponry NY Long Island Rail Service Resumes After Grand Central Fire NYC Mayoral Candidates All Agree on Building More Housing. But Where? Senator Calls for Closing Troubled ICE Detention Facility in New Mexico NJ\u2019s Sherrill, Ciattarelli Win Primaries in Governor\u2019s Race \u201cEurope has now awakened to the importance of these AI factories,\u201d said Huang, whose company is supplying chips for virtually every major AI-computing project under construction on the continent. Several of massive data centers will have more than a gigawatt of capacity, potentially ranking them among the largest in the world, he said during a company event jointly held with the VivaTech tech conference in Paris. \u201cThe researchers, the startups, your AI shortage, your GPU shortage will be resolved for you soon,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s coming.\u201d Europe lags behind the US in developing the infrastructure for AI and hasn\u2019t matched the spending committed by other regions. Huang said at an event in London on Monday with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer that a lack of infrastructure was holding back growth in a country that otherwise had the expertise and startups to be a global competitor in AI. His visits to London and Paris are part of a globe-trotting campaign to promote the adoption of AI and his company\u2019s products. While in Paris, Huang announced a raft of projects aimed at bolstering AI infrastructure across Europe. Nvidia is teaming up with Mistral AI to use local computing to run the startup\u2019s services. \u201cWe\u2019re going to build an AI cloud together,\u201d Huang said. An offering called Mistral Compute will tap 18,000 new Grace Blackwell chips from Nvidia. It will be developed in Mistral\u2019s data center in Essonne, France, and the company plans to roll it out to other locations in Europe. The chipmaker is trying to expand the market for AI accelerators \u2014 the processors used to develop and run AI models. Nvidia is pushing for countries to deploy technology on a national level and trying to make it easier for individual companies to get the benefits from AI. In the UK, AI firms Nebius Group NV and Nscale Global Holdings Ltd. will use thousands of such semiconductors for their own platforms. Other countries, including Italy and Armenia, also are installing new hardware, Nvidia said. In Europe, Nvidia is working with 1.5 million developers and 9,600 businesses, as well as 7,000 startups in what the company calls its inception program. \u201cThe only thing that\u2019s missing is infrastructure\u201d for Europe to keep pace in AI, Dion Harris, Nvidia\u2019s director of data center and high-performance computing, said in a briefing ahead of the presentations. Nvidia is working with cloud and telecommunications companies across Europe, he said. Huang also announced Wednesday that Nvidia will be building what he called \u201cthe world\u2019s first industrial AI cloud,\u201d which would be used to design and simulate the construction of everything from wind tunnels to robots to cars. Nvidia said in a statement that the Germany-based project will feature 10,000 graphics processing units, as well as several of its systems and servers. Santa Clara, California-based Nvidia has transformed its fortunes over the last three years and now earns almost as much revenue per quarter as Intel Corp., its longtime nemesis, does in a year. About half of its sales come from AI accelerator chips, which are used by many of the world\u2019s biggest companies, including Microsoft Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc., to develop AI software and services. The chipmaker is looking to reach a wider market by promoting the use of smaller-scale systems by companies and countries. Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s AWS, Mistral and others are joining its Lepton service, which helps connect AI developers with the computing hardware they need, according to Nvidia. It previously said cloud computing providers CoreWeave Inc. and SoftBank Group Corp. used the service. Nvidia said that European countries need help to get AI models deployed that are based on local languages and data. It\u2019s providing software and services that will accelerate those efforts. Separately, Nvidia said that vehicles using its chips and software are starting to appear on the road \u2014 the result of years of work. Mercedes-Benz Group AG\u2019s CLA models and forthcoming vehicles from Volvo and Jaguar will rely on its Drive platform. \u2014With assistance from Rachel Metz.

Rising housing costs pushed inflation up, while falling gas prices kept it from rising more than it did. \"Core\" inflation, which excludes volatile prices for food and energy, rose 2.8% over the year, the same as in April. Forecasters had expected core inflation to rise 2.9% annually, according to a survey of economists byDow Jones NewswiresandThe Wall Street Journal.

Prices for goods other than food and energy, the category with the most heavily-tariffed items, were up only 0.1% for the month. Prices for new cars fell 0.3% over the month despite foreign cars being subject to a 25% tariff.

Instead of spending it right away, consider one or more of these four smart strategies to grow your gift funds so you can achieve important life goals down the road. Even if you choose to skip the other strategies, any graduate who plans to hold on to some gift money should open a high-yield savings account. Your regular bank may offer little to no interest, but today\u2019s20 best savings accountspay 4.30% to 5.00% APY. By stashing your gift money in ahigh-yield savings account, you can watch it grow\u2014a gift your future self will appreciate\u2014while maintaining the flexibility to withdraw it whenever you need it. Just keep in mind that interest rates aren\u2019t set in stone. Banks andcredit unionscan adjust rates at any time, often without notice. With theFederal Reserveexpected to lower interest rates in 2025, savings account rates could drop as well. Since you never know when your current savings rate could drop, there's another option that's great if you don't need your savings for a little while: acertificate of deposit (CD). A CD is a type of bank or credit union account that involves an agreement between you and the institution: You agree to leave your money untouched until the CD'smaturitydate\u2014whether that\u2019s in a few months or a few years\u2014and the bank guarantees you a fixed interest rate for that duration. This means that even if interest rates drop due to Federal Reserve changes, the rate on your CD stays the same. No future moves by the Fed can change your locked-in CD rate. And right now, thebest nationwide CDsare offering 4.50% to 4.60% on terms ranging from a short 3 months to a 21-month certificate that promises its rate until early 2027. The trade-off with a CD is that cashing it out before maturity comes with anearly withdrawal penalty, which can vary from harsh to mild. So even though you've recently graduated from school, you'll still want to do your homework to determine what the early withdrawal penalty is for any CD you're considering. For some savers, the penalty for early CD withdrawal is a helpful deterrent, encouraging you to leave your money untouched for a set period to avoid spending on unplanned purchases. If you want to put some of your grad money to work for the long haul,consider investingit instead of simply saving it with a fixed interest rate. Stocks orETFsin a brokerage account could potentially offer much higher returns. And you don\u2019t need to be an expert\u2014investing in abroad-based index fundthat tracks the U.S. stock market is a simple, hands-off approach to get started. Keep in mind that investing is for the long term. The stock market can fluctuate, and there\u2019s no guarantee of short-term gains. But if you're saving for goals like a wedding, a down payment on a home, or long-term financial milestones, abrokerage accountcould be a smart way to grow your money over 5 to 10 years. Plus, you can continue to add to your investment account over time, either when you have extra funds or through regularautomated contributions. If you earn income this year from a job that reports wages to the IRS, you cancontribute to a Roth IRA\u2014a special investment account with tax-saving benefits that can help you build long-term wealth. In 2025,you can contribute up to $7,000, so long as you have at least that much in earned income. If you earned less, you can contribute up to the amount you made. For younger individuals with lower incomes, a Roth IRA can be especially beneficial. That's because Roth IRAs must be funded with post-tax money, but if you have a low income, you won't actually paymuch or any taxes. Meanwhile, money later withdrawn from a Roth IRA\u2014as well as all of its growth over the years\u2014will not be taxed. Put the two together and you could find yourself both contributingandwithdrawing from a Roth completely tax-free. Keep in mind that a Roth IRA is a retirement account, so there are restrictions on withdrawals. You can access your contributions at any time, but to withdraw earnings without tax or penalty, you need to be at least 59\u00bd years old. However, if you've had the Roth IRA for at least five years, you can withdraw up to$10,000 of earnings penalty-freefor a first-time home purchase. One important thing to note: The Roth IRA contribution limit of $7,000 (or your earned income for the year, whichever is less) resets every year. If you don\u2019t opt to contribute the full amount in the calendar year, you can\u2019t carry it over to put in more the next year. Eligible for a Roth IRA but can't contribute the full amount? If your parents, grandparents, or other loved ones are willing to help,they can boost your contributionto the maximum allowed. They could offer it as a direct gift or even match what you contribute yourself. If you're unsure how to use your graduation money but want to ensure some is saved for the future, consider combining strategies from above. For example, you could put part of your gift money into a high-yield savings account for easy access when needed, while allocating another portion to a longer-term option, such as a CD, brokerage account, or Roth IRA\u2014turning your graduation money into a gift that keeps giving for years to come. We update these rankings every business day to give you the best deposit rates available: Every business day, Investopedia tracks the rate data of more than 200 banks and credit unions that offer CDs and savings accounts to customers nationwide and determines daily rankings of the top-paying accounts. To qualify for our lists, the institution must be federally insured (FDICfor banks,NCUAfor credit unions), and the account's minimum initial deposit must not exceed $25,000. It also cannot specify amaximumdeposit amount that's below $5,000. Banks must be available in at least 40 states to qualify as nationally available. And while some credit unions require you to donate to a specific charity or association to become a member if you don't meet other eligibility criteria (e.g., you don't live in a certain area or work in a certain kind of job), we exclude credit unions whose donation requirement is $40 or more.

        "content": "As electric vehicles (EVs) go mainstream, now may be a good time toinvest in this growing industry. Not only are EVs heavily subsidized by the government, but consumers are becoming increasingly willing to pay a premium for sustainable products\u2014a recipe for long-term growth.Fortunately, there are many ways to gain exposure to the EV market. Read on to learn how. In 2025, more than 1 in 4 cars sold will be electric. By 2030, EVs\u2019 market share is expected to exceed 40% as they become even more affordable.As an investor, this is good news. It means you can ride this wave of growth to earn high potential returns. Here are some ways to invest directly in the EV industry: EV automaker Tesla (TSLA) is an obvious investment choice. The company launched in 2003 and released its first electric car, the Roadster, in 2008. Since then, Tesla has become the most well-known EV brand with a market capitalization that often exceeds that of all major American automakers combined. As of May 30, 2025, Tesla\u2019s market cap was $1.12 trillion. You can trade Tesla stock on the Nasdaq stock exchange through abrokeragelike Vanguard or Fidelity. Simply open an account and start buying shares (or fractional shares) of the company. While Tesla\u2019s stock value has been highly volatile over the last few years, it stands to gain from any long-term growth of the EV industry. Other publicly traded EV manufacturing companies include Rivian (RIVN), NIO (NIO), Li Auto (LI), XPeng (XPEV), and Lucid Motors (LCID). Alternatively, you can invest in legacy manufacturers who have added EVs to their car lineup. Among others, these include General Motors (GM), Toyota (TM), Honda (HMC), and Ford (F). Another way to invest in the EV industry is to invest in EV parts. For example, the battery is the most expensive part of an electric car. Most EV manufacturers use lithium-ion batteries sourced from suppliers like Plug Power (PLUG), QuantumScape (QM), and Solid Power (SLDP). You can also invest in other EV parts like chips, such as those made by NVIDIA (NVDA) and Ambarella (AMBA); lidar sensors, such as those made by Luminar (LAZR); or EV drivetrains, such as those made by Hyliion (HYLN). EV batteries rely heavily on raw materials (aka commodities) like lithium, copper, nickel, iron, silver, aluminum, and graphite. As a result, demand for them may rise as the EV industry grows. You can invest in metal production and distribution through companies like Sociedad Quimica y Minera S.A. (SQM) or Vale S.A. (VALE). While you can charge most EVs with a standard wall outlet (Level 1 charging), it\u2019s much slower than using a Level 2 or Direct Current Fast Charging (DCFC) station.Across the U.S., there are over 200,000 public charging stations\u2014a network well ahead of schedule to meet a national goal of 500,000 chargers by 2030. To invest inEV charging infrastructure, consider buying stock shares of companies like Blink Charging (BLNK), EVgo (EVGO), and ChargePoint (CHPT). EV charging stations are likely to grow in tandem with the EV industry as a whole. On January 10, 2025, the U.S. The Department of Transportation\u2019s Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) announced $635 million in grants to continue building electric vehicle charging and alternative fueling infrastructure with funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. This will add over 11,500 electric charging ports across 27 states, four Federally Recognized Tribes, and the District of Columbia. To invest in the EV industry without picking individual stocks, consider investing in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that follow EV-related indexes. This is a great way to spread your risk across multiple EV companies, so your returns don\u2019t depend on any one company. Instead, you\u2019ll capture any growth or contraction across the broader industry. Another benefit of ETFs is that they can be traded on the stock market just like stocks. This makes them highly liquid, so you can easily adjust your investment positions during market hours as needed (though abuy-and-hold strategymay yield better long-term returns). Some EV-related ETFs to choose from include: It can be. Many experts believe the EV industry will continue to grow due to rising consumer demand and government incentives. However, every investment carries risk, so carefully study the industry before deciding. In the case of EV investment, risk includes the possibility that future legislation will deprioritize green investment. Some risks include high market volatility, fierce competition between EV companies, uncertainty over how the technology will evolve, supply chain issues, and changing regulatory environments. Yes, you can invest through EV-focused ETFs, which follow the performance of multiple EV companies through an index. Stocks offer higher potential returns (and risk) from individual companies, while ETFs provide diversification across the industry, resulting in lower potential returns but less volatility. Among other things, look for innovation, sizable market share, healthy financial performance, and strategic partnerships that could boost the company\u2019s growth. Possibly. Electric vehicles are becoming increasingly popular, with global EV sales growing rapidly and projections showing they could make up over 40% of new car sales by 2030. The electric vehicle market is growing fast. Whether you invest directly in automakers, battery suppliers, raw materials, or charging infrastructure\u2014or take a broader approach with EV-focused ETFs\u2014there are many ways to gain exposure to the industry. To get started, assess your risk tolerance and choose a strategy that aligns with your financial goals. Don\u2019t be afraid to diversify your investments to balance potential rewards with long-term stability.",

        "header": "Biotech Boom: How Revolutionary Advancements Are Shaping Stock Market Trends",
        "content": "More people need better medicines, and there is a rising demand for food and sustainable solutions. This is why governments and privateinvestorsare spending more on research and development in the biotechnology industry. The biotech market is expected to grow from $1.74 trillion in 2025 to $5.04 trillion by 2034, with an annual growth rate of 12.5%. This \"biotech boom\" reflects rapid scientific innovation, surging capital inflows, and growing demand for medical and agricultural breakthroughs. From gene-editing therapies to AI-driven drug discovery, these advancements are creating new opportunities and risks for investors. The biotech boom refers to a period of unprecedented growth in biotechnology, marked by scientific breakthroughs, increased funding, and widespreadcommercializationof innovations. Unlike traditional sectors,biotech merges biology with technologyto solve challenges in medicine, food production, and environmental sustainability. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted its potential, with mRNA vaccines developed in record time. Today, advancements such as CRISPR gene editing and personalized cancer therapies are propelling the sector into mainstream markets, attracting both institutional and retail investors.The ongoing impact is profound: new drugs and therapies are improving quality of life, while economic opportunities are expanding through job creation, investment, and the emergence of new markets. Biotechnology\u2019s recent breakthroughs are reshaping the industry and investor expectations. Notable advancements include: These new technologies are also helping other fields, such as agriculture and environmental science. Genetically modified crops can grow better and resist pests, helping farmers to produce more food. Biotech methods are also used to clean up pollution and protect the environment. The biotech boom has brought in large amounts of money from many types of investors.Venture capitalfunding for biotech start-ups more than doubled from 2020 to 2021, reaching over $48 billion. Even though investments slowed in 2023, there is still strong interest in new biotech ideas, especially in rare diseases and new technologies. Research and development spending is also rising in the biotech industry. In 2023, U.S. biopharmaceutical companies spent about $96 billion on research, which was more than 20% of their total sales. This focus on research helps companies create new medicines and stay ahead in the market. Public markets are also seeing more activity from biotech companies. In 2024,biotechIPOs increased, and follow-on stock offerings were up 64% compared to 2023. This means more biotech companies are raising money by selling shares to the public. Mergers and acquisitions are another big trend in biotech investing. Large pharmaceutical companies are buying smaller biotech firms to add new products and keep their businesses strong. This is especially important as older drugs lose their patents and face more competition. The global biotechnology market was valued at $1.74 trillion in 2025 and is expected to reach $5.04 trillion by 2034.Many factors drive this rapid rise, helping biotechnology reach more people and industries. One major driver is the growing demand for better health care solutions. More people have chronic diseases, and there is a greater need for personalized medicine that fits each person\u2019s unique needs. Biotechnology companies are developing new drugs and treatments to meet these health challenges. Agriculture is also seeing significant changes thanks to biotechnology. Genetically modified crops and tissue culture technologies help farmers grow more food and use resources more efficiently.These advances make farming more sustainable and help feed a growing world population. Environmental science is another area where biotechnology is making a difference. New biotech solutions are helping to control pollution, manage waste, and create materials that are better for the planet. These efforts support a cleaner and more sustainable environment. Collaboration is helping the biotechnology market grow even faster. Companies and research institutions are working together to share knowledge and lower the costs of developing new products. These partnerships speed up innovation and quickly bring new solutions to the market. North America, especially the United States, is still the leader in biotech innovation and investment. However, the Asia-Pacific region is growing quickly, led by China, India, Japan, and South Korea, thanks to government support, skilled workers, and cost advantages. Europe is also strong, with important biotech hubs in Switzerland, Germany, and the U.K., and a focus on rare diseases and research partnerships. Emerging markets in Latin America and Africa are investing more in biotech, mainly for agriculture and fighting infectious diseases.Major companies are expanding their networks and forming partnerships to reach these fast-growing markets. This global expansion is helping biotech companies find new opportunities and drive innovation worldwide. The regulatory landscape is evolving to keep pace with rapid biotech innovation: Biotech\u2019s economic footprint is expanding rapidly: Gene editing (CRISPR), AI-driven drug discovery, and precision medicine are leading trends, transforming health care, agriculture, and environmental science. Many analysts believe the sector is entering a new cycle of innovation and investment, making it an attractive area for long-term investors. However, the sector remains volatile and requires careful stock selection. Biotech investing carries significant risks, including regulatory hurdles, clinical trial failures, and intense competition. Investors should conduct thorough research and consider diversification. Current top biotech stocks include CRISPR Therapeutics, Illumina, Regeneron, Vertex, and Bayer, each with strong pipelines and leadership in their respective niches. The biotech boom is transforming not only the stock market but also the way we approach health, food, and the environment. Revolutionary technologies, robust investment, and global expansion are driving unprecedented growth, while evolving regulations and economic impact ensure the sector\u2019s influence will continue to expand. For investors, the opportunities are significant\u2014but so are the risks. Staying informed about trends, innovations, and market dynamics is essential for anyone looking to capitalize on biotechnology\u2019s next wave.",

        "header": "The Basics of Tech Stocks: 10 Tips Every New Investor Needs To Know",
        "content": "Just as technology is foundational to our modern way of life, the tech sector is the backbone of today\u2019s global economy. With a totalmarket capitalizationof roughly $19 trillion, it also offers investors the potential for exceptional returns, led by industry titans like Apple, Microsoft, and NVIDIA. At the same time, tech is one of the most volatile and fast-moving stock market areas, making it challenging to navigate\u2014especially for beginners. Let\u2019s explore what new investors should know about tech stocks, including 10 practical tips to help you harness their potential while managing risk. Thetechnology sector contains companiesinvolved in the research, development, support, and distribution of technology-based goods and services. It covers a range of industries, including electronics manufacturing, software, social media, information technology, and more. Because of its central role in business and consumer markets, the tech sector is often one of the most attractive areas forgrowth investing. It has historically outperformed, especially during periods of economic expansion. For example, between January 2017 and June 2025, it returned 441.79% compared to just 151.14% from the S&P 500. In recent years, a small group of dominant companies known as theMagnificent Seven(Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, NVIDIA, Meta, and either Broadcom or Tesla) has been responsible for a significant portion of the S&P 500\u2019s overall performance. As of May 2025, they represent roughly 30% of the S&P 500\u2019s overall weighting. What makes the tech sector unique is its consistent innovation and disruption. New technologies can rapidly reshape industries, consumer behavior, and the global economy. For example, in 2025,developments in artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and automation are transforming how businesses operate across nearly every sector. Stock picking\u2014and even sector picking\u2014are inherently risky strategies, especially for new investors. It can lead to concentration risk, missed opportunities, or emotional decision-making during downturns. When asked what advice he\u2019d give to a new investor interested in tech stocks,Lawrence Sprung, CFP, founder of Mitlin Financial, said: \u201cI would probably try to steer them away from trying to pick individual stocks, especially newer names. It's difficult to figure out over the next three, five, or 10 years, who the biggest winners are going to actually be. I would even say that in terms of sectors too. AI is the term that everybody's talking about, but maybe that changes three years from now.\u201d The tech sector also carries its own set of specific risks. Because innovation and disruption are central to its industries, competition is intense, andvolatilitycan be high. Many tech companies must also navigate evolving government regulations, especially in data privacy,antitrust enforcement, and oversight of emerging technologies. Environmental impact is another growing concern. Technology-based operations are often energy-intensive or generate significant electronic waste, which may invite future restrictions or pushback from consumers with sustainability concerns. Avoiding investments that conflict with your values\u2014and purchasing those that align with them\u2014is a practice known asethical investing. One of the primary ways to evaluate tech stocks is throughfundamental analysis. This involves studying its financial metrics, such as revenue, earnings, cash flow, andprice-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. These figures can help you assess a company\u2019s growth, profitability, and valuation compared to competitors. It can also be beneficial to consider other types of performance metrics. For example, many tech firms are in software, streaming, or social media, making measures likemonthly active users (MAU)especially valuable for assessing market share and long-term potential. \u201cTech stocks can be thrilling, but don't let excitement override due diligence,\u201d saidJordan Gilberti, CFP, founder of Sage Wealth Group. \u201cThe allure of rapid growth in tech can tempt investors to overlook fundamentals. For tech companies, consistent revenue growth indicates market demand, while healthy profit margins and positive cash flow suggest operational efficiency and financial stability.\u201d When evaluating tech stocks, considercompany liquidityduring your broader fundamental analysis. That refers to its ability to meet its short-term obligations\u2014typically those due over the next 12 months\u2014usingcurrent assets, like cash, accounts receivable, and inventory. Liquidityis especially significant in the fast-moving tech world, where companies must respond quickly to shifting regulations, emerging competitors, or new technological developments. Without sufficiently liquid resources, even profitable firms could stumble when they need to pivot. Two popular liquidity measures are thecurrent ratio and the quick ratio. The current ratio compares all current assets to current liabilities, while the quick ratio excludes inventory for a more conservative perspective. Ratios above one generally indicate a company is liquid enough to cover its short-term debts, but consider comparing a company\u2019s metrics to those of similar firms for more context. Comparing company metrics to broad sector averages can be misleading, especially in tech, where capital structures vary significantly betweenindustries. Another critical area of fundamental analysis issolvency, which refers to a company\u2019s ability to meet its long-term obligations beyond the next 12 months. Tech companies often take on significant debt to fuel growth during early stages and aggressive expansion periods. While some leverage may be necessary, excessive debt can increase financial risk, especially when interest rates rise. To evaluate solvency, investors can look at ratios likedebt-to-equity (D/E)anddebt-to-assets (D/A), which compare a company\u2019s total liabilities to its equity and assets, respectively. In both cases, a lower ratio is generally better, but as with liquidity, it\u2019s best to compare solvency metrics to similar firms within the same tech niche. In addition to analyzing historical data, it\u2019s important to monitor what tech companies expect. Fortunately, public companies regularly issue earnings guidance, which includes projections for upcoming performance targets. Third-party analysts also frequently release forecasts based on market conditions and company signals. Not only can theseforward-looking estimateshelp inform your understanding of a company\u2019s financial strength and performance, but they can also significantly influence stock prices. For example, a company that beats expectations may see its stock rise, while one that falls short may see declines. Because these predictions are only estimates, take them with a grain of salt. \u201cOverly optimistic projections without clear execution plans can signal potential overvaluation,\u201d Gilberti said. \u201cInvestors should be wary of companies prioritizing growth at the expense of profitability, as this can lead to unsustainable business practices.\u201d In addition to keeping up with company-specific developments, it\u2019s important to pay attention to news that affects the entire tech sector. For example, regulatory changes, broader economic shifts, and technological breakthroughs can all cause widespread disruptions that impact individual stocks. Ground-breaking developments may arise more frequently in the tech sector, which moves faster than most. To stay current, consider following reputable financial news outlets, subscribing to tech-focused newsletters, and setting alerts for key topics or companies. Many brokerage platforms, like Fidelity and Charles Schwab, offer tools that can provide real-time news tailored to your portfolio. When evaluating a tech stock, don\u2019t overlook the people steering the ship. \u201cLeadership's ability to foster innovation while maintaining operational discipline can significantly influence a company's long-term performance,\u201d said Gilberti. In some cases, iconic leaders like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk have become synonymous with their companies, contributing to brand prestige and investor confidence. You can learn a lot by researching a CEO\u2019s background and studying how they operate through public interviews, earnings calls, and shareholder communications. \u201cA strong management team demonstrates vision, adaptability, and a track record of executing strategies successfully,\u201d said Gilberti. Because tech is one of the most exciting sectors in the stock market, it\u2019s easy to get carried away and allow it to dominate too much of your portfolio. As Gilberti said, \u201cOverconcentration in popular tech stocks is a frequent misstep.\u201d New investors often gravitate toward big names like the Magnificent Seven, but even the strongest companies can falter unexpectedly. \u201cI would encourage folks, if they're interested in the tech sector, to go about it in a diversified fashion,\u201d said Sprung. \u201cBy investing in various companies within various areas, they can really mitigate their risk.\u201d For example, the rightindex fundcould provide exposure to the entire tech sector with a single asset. Diversifyinginto assets that respond differently to the same event may reduce the impact of any one risk, but it can\u2019t eliminate the possibility of losses. The tech sector can be highly reactive to headlines, earnings reports, and emerging trends, making it tempting to chase short-term gains. \u201cThe fast-paced nature of the tech sector can elicit strong emotional responses, leading to impulsive decisions,\u201d said Gilberti. However, that approach often results in buying high and selling low\u2014the opposite ofthe famous adage\u2014and weaker long-term returns. To stay grounded, follow along-term investment strategyaligned with your goals,risk tolerance, andtime horizon. \u201cEmotional discipline is as important as analytical rigor in investing. Remember, successful investing often involves staying the course amidst market noise,\u201d said Gilberti. Ironically, one of the best ways to invest in the tech sector is to leverage technology yourself. Modern investing platforms offer many tools to help you stay informed, reduce emotional decision-making, and manage your portfolio more efficiently. For example, as Gilberti said, \u201cUtilizing tools like automatic portfolio rebalancing and setting predetermined criteria for buying or selling can help maintain objectivity.\u201d These tools are only getting more sophisticated, especially with theincorporation of AI. For example, you can now buy AI-managed ETFs or invest through AI-powered robo-advisors. Keeping up with these advancements\u2014and learning to leverage them\u2014may give you an edge in the very sector that creates them. Tech stocks are popular for their high growth potential, strong track record of outperformance, and connection with attention-grabbing innovations. The tech sector is also deeply embedded in nearly every aspect of modern life, and many top tech companies are led by popular CEOs who attract investor attention. Two of the most common ways to evaluate a tech stock include fundamental and technical analysis. Fundamental analysis involves assessing a stock\u2019s intrinsic value based on company metrics, like revenue and profit margin. Technical analysis involves predicting a stock\u2019s future price movements based on its historical performance. Adding tech stocks to your portfolio can give you exposure to one of the most historically lucrative and exciting areas of the stock market. However, while the tech sector offers high growth potential, it\u2019s important to have a well-diversified portfolio and avoid overconcentration risk. The tech sector plays a central role in the modern global economy and offers enticing growth potential for investors. However, successful tech stock investing requires careful analysis of company-specific fundamentals and broader market dynamics, along with healthy diversification and the discipline to keep up a long-term investing strategy.",

        "content": "Software company Oracle (ORCL) is scheduled to report fiscal fourth-quarter earnings after the bell on Wednesday, and traders see potential for the stock to hit a record high on the results. Oracle shares are expected to move about 7.2% in either direction by the end of the week, according to options pricing data. That would put shares at about $190, their highest price this year and just 1% shy of a record, or about $164, which would erase the stock\u2019s gains so far this month. Oracle stock has climbed steadily in recent weeks as investors have embraced the AI trade amid waning economic uncertainty. Shares are up about 45% since hitting a year-to-date low in mid-April, and about 7% since the start of the year. Oracle shares have moved an average of 8.6% the day after its four most recent earnings reports. Oracle has missed sales and adjusted earnings estimates in each of its last two reports, causing shares to fall 3.1% after earningsin Marchand 6.7%in December. Shares jumped double digits in the two prior quarters after announcing cloud computing deals withAmazon(AMZN),Microsoft(MSFT), OpenAI, and Alphabet\u2019s (GOOGL) Google. Wall Street is split onthe outlook for Oracle stock. Of the 13 Oracle analysts tracked by Visible Alpha, 6 recommend buying the stock and 7 have assigned it a \u201chold\u201d rating.

The retailer said Wednesday that its comparable sales decline by 5.7% in the quarter, compared to the 3.9% drop that analysts had forecast, according to estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. J.Jill's first-quarter sales came in narrowly below estimates at $153.62 million, while adjusted earnings per share of $0.88 was in line with the analyst consensus. \"Given the increased uncertainty with respect to the macroeconomic environment, along with the Company\u2019s recent leadership transition, the Company is withdrawing its prior guidance for fiscal 2025 and is temporarily suspending its practice of providing forward guidance with the exception of total capital expenditures and net new store openings,\" the company said. The company announced the hiring of a new CEO in February, with Mary Ellen Coyne taking over at the start of May following the retirement of CEO Claire Spofford. J.Jill also said it expects capital expenditures of $20 million to $25 million in this fiscal year, and expects to record a net gain of one to five new stores this year, after it closed three stores in the first quarter.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp. Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang projected that Europe\u2019s artificial-intelligence computing capacity will increase by a factor of ten over the next two years, with more than 20 so-called AI factories in the works. Most Read from Bloomberg Trump\u2019s Military Parade Has Washington Bracing for Tanks and Weaponry Shuttered NY College Has Alumni Fighting Over Its Future NYC Renters Brace for Price Hikes After Broker-Fee Ban NY Long Island Rail Service Resumes After Grand Central Fire NYC Mayoral Candidates All Agree on Building More Housing. But Where? \u201cEurope has now awakened to the importance of these AI factories,\u201d said Huang, whose company is supplying chips for virtually every major AI-computing project. Several of massive data centers will have more than a gigawatt of capacity, potentially ranking them among the largest in the world, he said during a company event jointly held with the VivaTech tech conference in Paris. \u201cThe researchers, the startups, your AI shortage, your GPU shortage will be resolved for you soon,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s coming.\u201d Europe lags behind the US in developing the infrastructure for AI and hasn\u2019t matched the spending committed by other regions. Huang said at an event in London on Monday with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer that a lack of infrastructure was holding back growth in a country that otherwise had the expertise and startups to be a global competitor in AI. His visits to London and Paris are part of a globe-trotting campaign to promote the adoption of AI and his company\u2019s products. Huang didn\u2019t say how much he thought the planned AI factories in Europe would ultimately cost. He estimated later in his speech that a single one could cost as much as $50 billion. In February, the European Union announced a new \u20ac20 billion ($23 billion) fund for five AI gigafactories dedicated to development and training of next-generation AI models, each with over 100,000 processors. While in Paris, Huang announced a raft of projects aimed at bolstering AI infrastructure across Europe. Nvidia is teaming up with Mistral AI to use local computing to run the startup\u2019s services. \u201cWe\u2019re going to build an AI cloud together,\u201d Huang said. An offering called Mistral Compute will tap 18,000 new Grace Blackwell chips from Nvidia. It will be developed in Mistral\u2019s data center in Essonne, France, and the company plans to roll it out to other locations in Europe. French President Emmanuel Macron cheered the tie-up between the two firms, asking French and European companies to use the new AI computing offering. \u201cI want to encourage all the large companies and startups to join this team,\u201d Macron said at an event, making it part of a \u201cfight for sovereignty and strategic autonomy.\u201d Nvidia is trying to expand the market for AI accelerators \u2014 the processors used to develop and run AI models. The chipmaker is pushing for countries to deploy technology on a national level and trying to make it easier for individual companies to get the benefits from AI. \u201cI\u2019m here to make it possible for every country to have their own sovereign AI. AI starts with data,\u201d Huang told reporters at a briefing. \u201cYou got to take that data. Don\u2019t export it. Just buy a machine.\u201d In the UK, AI firms Nebius Group NV and Nscale Global Holdings Ltd. will use thousands of such semiconductors for their own platforms. Other countries, including Italy and Armenia, also are installing new hardware, Nvidia said. In Europe, Nvidia is working with 1.5 million developers and 9,600 businesses, as well as 7,000 startups in what the company calls its inception program. \u201cThe only thing that\u2019s missing is infrastructure\u201d for Europe to keep pace in AI, Dion Harris, Nvidia\u2019s director of data center and high-performance computing, said in a briefing ahead of the presentations. Nvidia is working with cloud and telecommunications companies across Europe, he said. Huang also announced Wednesday that Nvidia will be building what he called \u201cthe world\u2019s first industrial AI cloud,\u201d which would be used to design and simulate everything from wind tunnels to robots to cars. Nvidia said in a statement that the Germany-based project will feature 10,000 graphics processing units, as well as several of its systems and servers. Santa Clara, California-based Nvidia has transformed its fortunes over the last three years and now earns almost as much revenue per quarter as Intel Corp., its longtime nemesis, does in a year. About half of its sales come from AI accelerator chips, which are used by many of the world\u2019s biggest companies, including Microsoft Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc., to develop AI software and services. The chipmaker is looking to reach a wider market by promoting the use of smaller-scale systems by companies and countries. Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s AWS, Mistral and others are joining its Lepton service, which helps connect AI developers with the computing hardware they need, according to Nvidia. It previously said cloud computing providers CoreWeave Inc. and SoftBank Group Corp. used the service. Nvidia said that European countries need help to get AI models deployed that are based on local languages and data. It\u2019s providing software and services that will accelerate those efforts. Separately, Nvidia said that vehicles using its chips and software are starting to appear on the road \u2014 the result of years of work. Mercedes-Benz Group AG\u2019s CLA models and forthcoming vehicles from Volvo and Jaguar will rely on its Drive platform. --With assistance from Rachel Metz.

        "content": "Intel CorporationINTC stock plunged 70% post chip foundry venture, yet Lip-Bu Tan\u2019s appointment as new CEO and recent 10% stock rise hint at a potential turnaround. Is it a good buy now? Let\u2019s see. Both Intel andNVIDIA CorporationNVDA produce graphics processing units (GPUs) that are essential for modern computing, including machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI). However, NVIDIA\u2019s CUDA software and Blackwell chips are highly sought after by developers and customers. The superior products from NVIDIA have allowed the company to secure a substantial share in most major AI segments, including data centers (read more: Is NVIDIA's Rise in Value a Sign to Invest in NVDA Stock?). Of course, it\u2019s challenging for Intel to compete with NVIDIA, but the former has more room to grow with a market capitalization of under $100 billion compared to NVIDIA\u2019s $3 trillion plus. Moreover, Intel\u2019s affordable AI accelerators can rival NVIDIA\u2019s. Intel is spending billions of dollars on enhancing its AI capabilities and may enter the market with energy-efficient chips. In the last two years, Intel has spent over $50 billion on upgrading its chip-manufacturing facilities. Such staggering infrastructure costs have made investors nervous due to the unprofitable foundry business. Intel\u2019s foundry business continues to face tough competition from the likes ofTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company LimitedTSM, or TSMC, and Samsung. However, TSMC and Samsung located in Southeast Asia, have manufacturing centers in China. The ongoing trade tensions between the United States and China could disrupt their business. In contrast, Intel\u2019s chip-making hubs are primarily in the United States, allowing domestic semiconductor companies to send chip orders to these facilities and bypass trade restrictions. Despite losing the top semiconductor title, Intel generated revenues of $12.7 billion in the first quarter of 2025, outpacing arch-rivalAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.\u2019s AMD $7.4 billion. This serves as a clear indication that Intel is making strides in the semiconductor industry and is well-positioned for a comeback. Last but not least, Lip-Bu Tan\u2019s appointment as the CEO of Intel has been well-received by market pundits, as his stint in the semiconductor industry has been productive. Tan\u2019s initiatives to streamline operations, deliver a competitive AI platform, and spin-off assets would restore stability at Intel and help the company return to its past glory. With Lip-Bu Tan leading Intel\u2019s foundry recovery and AI accelerators gaining ground among competitors through cost advantages, holding onto INTC stock seems judicious. Intel\u2019s business revival is becoming more probable, and brokers are showing optimism by increasing the short-term price target for INTC to $22.42 (up 9.5%) from $20.48. The highest target is $62, indicating a potential 202.7% upside. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research However, Intel\u2019s net profit margin is negative at 36.2%, while the Semiconductor - General industries have a margin of 49.5%, suggesting financial instability due to expenses surpassing revenues.

        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)is launching Europe's first Industrial AI Cloudto turbocharge manufacturing, deploying 10,000 GPUsincluding DGX B200 systems and RTX PRO serversacross a Germany-based AI factory that runs CUDA-X libraries, RTX and Omniverse workloads from Siemens (SIEGY), Ansys (NASDAQ:ANSS), Cadence (NASDAQ:CDNS) and Rescale. The cloud will handle every step of production, from design and engineering simulation to factory digital twins and autonomous robotics, giving European OEMs a turnkey path to AI-driven operations. Several blue-chip customers have already signed on: BMW Group, Maserati, Mercedes-Benz and Schaeffler will use Nvidia-accelerated applications to simulate product lifecycles, optimize factory layouts and automate logistics at scale. By adhering to the Omniverse Blueprint for AI factory designcomplete with Cadence's Reality Digital Twin Platformengineering teams can model the entire facility in a virtual environment before breaking ground. CEO Jensen Huang calls this the next industrial revolution, promising a tenfold boost in compute capacity for European industry over the next two years. Why It Matters: Embedding AI infrastructure directly into manufacturing hubs will slash development cycles, cut capital costs and help Europe retain its competitive edge against Asia's mass-production juggernauts. That said, Nvidia is sitting comfortably, with analysts projecting a 12-month price target of $174.71 nearly 22% higher than current levels. The spread is wide, though, with bullish forecasts reaching up to $372.90 and more cautious estimates around $100. The chart shows a relatively stable ride over the past year, but expectations are clearly skewing optimistic heading into 2026. Investors seem to be betting big on AI-driven growth.

Jensen said he has a solid relationship with the president and that the president has a plan. He made it sound like there could conceivably be a deal that would be incredibly impactful. [Referring to the U.S.-China trade talks that are to be held in London on Monday] So now we go back to this.

        "content": "Rigetti Computing(RGTI11.16%)stock is roaring higher in Wednesday's trading thanks to multiple positive catalysts. The quantum computing specialist's share price was up 10.9% as of 3:30 p.m. ET. Shares had been up as much as 20.6% earlier in the daily session. Rigetti's valuation is getting a huge boost today afterNvidiaCEO Jensen Huang made comments suggesting that quantum computing technologies could be ready to take off. The stock is also getting a lift from better-than-expected inflation data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) today. Image source: Getty Images. Nvidia kicked off its GTC Paris developers conference this morning, and CEO Jensen Huang had some promising things to say about the trajectory of quantum computing technologies. \"Quantum computing is reaching an inflection point,\" Huang said in his keynote speech for the conference this morning. The CEO's comments kicked off another powerful rally for quantum computing stocks, and Rigetti's valuation has surged thanks to the catalyst. The Bureau of Labor Statistics published May's consumer price index (CPI) inflation data this morning, and the results seem to bode well for Rigetti Computing stock. Core CPI, which is a measure for inflation that looks at prices for a combination of goods and excludes food and energy expenses, rose at a 2.8% annual rate last month. Core CPI inflation ticked up just 0.1% compared to April's figure. Meanwhile, economists had expected that annual inflation for core CPI would be up 2.9% and that monthly inflation would be up 0.2%. Core CPI came in cooler than expected, and this seemingly supports the notion that theFederal Reserveis seeing economic data that leaves the door open for an interest rate cut this year. If the Fed does deliver a rate cut, that would likely be a strong positive catalyst for Rigetti Computing and other speculative growth stocks.",

        "content": "Strategy\u2014the freshly rebranded MicroStrategy (MSTR)\u2014has shifted from being an enterprise software firm that sells business-intelligence (BI) tools to the world\u2019s largestcorporate owner of bitcoin. It holds about 581,000 bitcoins, worth around $63 billion, which is significantly higher than its annual software revenue of about $463 million.(All data here and below are as of early June 2025.) Founder and CEO Michael Saylor calls the company a \u201cBitcoin Treasury Company,\u201d a moniker the early 2025 name change makes explicit.To fund this hoard, Strategy has issued waves of zero-coupon convertible notes and new equity, turning itself into a leveraged bet on \"digital gold.\" Michael Saylor co-founded MicroStrategy in 1989.Through the 1990s the firm landed data-mining deals with McDonald\u2019s and others, and went public in 1998, briefly making Saylor a paper billionaire during the dot-com boom.After nearly going bankrupt because of a 2000 accounting scandal that resulted in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission settlement, the company steadily pivoted toward cloud analytics. Fast-forward to August 2020, when Saylor first deployed some $250 million of idle cash into bitcoin, citing cash-debasement fears. Multiple follow-on buys\u2014financed first with cash, then with debt\u2014turned the firm into \u201cWall Street\u2019s bitcoin proxy.\u201dThe company's metamorphosis was completed with Strategy's name change, complete with an orange palette inspired by bitcoin. Saylor champions his \u201cinfinite money glitch,\u201d arguing that borrowing cheaply against stock to buy scarcer bitcoin offers shareholders leveraged digital gold exposure. Other high-profile companies are looking to follow Strategy's Bitcoin treasury playbook, with both Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT) and GameStop Corp. (GME)\u00a0announcing massive fundraising in 2025 to do so. Strategy rarely pays cash for coins anymore. Instead, MSTR prefers to issuezero-coupon convertible noteswith generous conversion premiums, effectively providing free money unless the stock tanks.It had already raised billions of dollars this way, part of a pattern that Bloomberg says has madeconvertible-arbitrage\u201cWall Street\u2019s hottest trade.\u201d Issuing equity is another lever: during the first quarter of 2025 alone, Strategy sold $7.7 billion in new shares and then bought another 22,048 BTC at an average price of about $87,000. To back this financial engineering, Strategy's slide deck often highlights the following metrics: However, the math only works if Bitcoin continues to rise. A 30% slide in March briefly saddled the company with an unrealized $5.9 billion loss, rattling MSTR\u2019s share price.Analysts warn thatprolonged crypto winterswould squeeze cash flow and could force asset sales or refinancings that dilute shareholder value. Its zero-coupon structure, furthermore, can let bondholders demand cash back if volatility spikes, creating a reflexive risk loop for shareholders. Still, MSTR's recent inclusion in theNasdaq-100has meant thatpassive index fundstracking it have bought its shares, which will help cushion any potential drawdowns. Investors looking to Strategy as a BTC play might be getting played themselves: At a market cap of $105.28 billion and bitcoin holdings at about $62.6 billion, that's almost a 70% premium over its BTC holdings. Compare that to most closed-end funds (where a 10% premium is pricey) or the Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust ETF (BTC), where our calculations show a 3.2%discountof its share price to net asset value per share.For every $1.00 you invest, MSTR provides $0.59 worth of BTC exposure, whereas for the BTC ETF, you get $1.03. Strategy continues to sell its\u00a0Strategy One\u00a0analytics suite\u2014an AI-infused business intelligence and data platform, which has sustained growth in subscriptions.The company also runs\u00a0Strategy World, an annual technology conference that, in 2025, spotlighted newgenerative AIfeatures rolling into its platform. Strategy has morphed from a middling BI vendor into a leveraged macro bet on Bitcoin, wrapped around its still-functioning software business. If the crypto bull run persists, shareholders will reap the gains from embedded leverage in both equity and convertibles. If the tide turns, however, the same leverage will magnify the drawdowns.",

        "content": "Bitcoin (BTCUSD) has rallied over the past week to approach the record high it set last month, tracking the strong performance of U.S. equities and encouraging signals about the U.S. economy. The legacy cryptocurrency moved as high as $110,400 Wednesday morning after a closely watched inflation report showed thatconsumer prices rose less than expectedlast month, good news for investors who are hoping the Federal Reserve could be in a position to cut its benchmark interest rate this year. The price of bitcoin dropped to $108,800 recently, asU.S. stocks backed off their earlier highsas well. Once a fringe financial asset dismissed by the mainstream, cryptocurrencies have gained new legitimacy this year thanks in part to the support of President Donald Trump and several allies in Congress. The price of bitcoin has also been supported by surging demand from publicly traded companies, such as Strategy (MSTR), that use proceeds from equity sales to purchase bitcoin for corporate treasuries. Meanwhile, total assets inbitcoin exchange traded fundshave ballooned to $132 billion this month, up from $91 billion in early April, pointing to growinginstitutionalinterest in the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin last hit a record high, of just under $112,000, on May 22. The digital currency has gained about 16% since the start of the year, far outpacing the performance of major stock indexes. Below, we take a closer look at Bitcoin\u2019s chart and applytechnical analysisto identify key price levels worth watching out for. After hitting itsall-time highlast month, bitcoin\u2019s price consolidated within aflag, a chart pattern that indicates a continuation of the cryptocurrency'suptrendthat started in early April. Indeed, the digital asset staged a decisivebreakoutabove the pattern earlier this week, laying the groundwork for a new move higher. Meanwhile, therelative strength indexconfirms bullish price momentum, though the indicator remains belowoverboughtlevels, providing ample room for further upside. In another win for bitcoin bulls, the50-day moving average (MA)crossed above the 200-day MA last month to form a bullishgolden crosssignal. Let\u2019s identify two key overhead areas to watch amid the potential for further buying and also locatesupport levelsworth monitoring duringprofit-takingperiods. The first overhead area to watch sits around $112,000. This area on the chart will likely attract significant scrutiny near last month\u2019speak. A move higher could see bitcoin rally toward $137,000. We projected this target by extracting the price bars comprising the cryptocurrency\u2019s uptrend that preceded the flag and repositioning them from the pattern\u2019s breakout area. We selected this prior trend as it commenced following a breakout from apennant patternin late April, providing clues as to how the current breakout from a period of consolidation may unfold. During profit-taking, investors should initially monitor the $107,000 level. A retest of the prominent December and January peaks may be necessary before the cryptocurrency makes a meaningful move higher. Finally, a deeperretracementcould see bitcoin\u2019s price revisit the closely-watched $100,000 level. This area would likely provide support near thepsychological round numberand a trendline that connects a range of corresponding trading activity on the chart stretching back to last November.

Oracle shares are getting a lift in Wednesday's extended hours on its earnings beat and strong guidance for fiscal full-year 2026. Citizens Head of Technology Equity Research Pat Walravens comes on Market Domination Overtime to talk more about Oracle's growth rate expectations on its cloud business, its advantage against other hyperscalers, and the company's partnership with Nvidia (NVDA) that enables it to just focus on building out its infrastructure. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Domination Overtimehere. Oracle shares are rising after reporting a beat on earnings in the fourth quarter. The company also expecting a triple digit multi cloud revenue growth rate to continue in fiscal year 2026. For more we get to citizens head of technology equity research, Patrick Walravens. Pat, great to see you. This forecast made me sit up and take notice. I don't know about you, is this a rate that was expected here? This just feels like an awful lot of growth for an awfully big company. Okay. First of all, it's absolutely remarkable, right? And as you say, for a $60 billion company to talk about numbers like this is amazing. And I'll I'll I'll touch on them quickly in a second. But I will say this, um, Safra Katz has been telling you this is coming, and it's been a long wait for people who own the stock, because remember they missed the last two quarters, both on the top and the bottom line, despite the fact that they were booking an enormous amount of business. So last quarter, they had the top and bottom line miss, but they told you they'd had their strongest bookings quarter ever. And so what you're seeing happen now is all of that business that they've been booking is finally starting to turn into revenue. And so, um, they mentioned that their cloud business, which grew 24% this last year in fiscal 25, would grow over 40 this coming year. The cloud infrastructure, which grew 50% in the last year will grow over 70 and, um, that their RPO, which an RPO stands for remaining performance obligation, and I know it's kind of jargonish, but that's basically their bookings. It's their backlog. And so their backlog will double again in the next year. So Oracle's been working hard, putting a lot of pieces in place, and you're finally seeing it all come to fruition this quarter. Pat, when you think about OCI, Oracle Cloud infrastructure, which is competing there with Amazon and Microsoft and Google, all those hyperscalers we talked so much about, Pat, what are OCI's competitive competitive advantages in that fight, Pat? What what do they bring to the table? You know, it's it's it's a great question, and it's funny because Larry Ellison has been running the same playbook. I mean, he started this company in the late 70s. I've been covering it, believe it or not, since 2002, right? But he he runs the same playbook over and over again. And and that playbook is, um, make products that perform better at a lower cost. And the way he words it is is is kind of funny. He words it as we have to give you more for less constantly. And so the Gen2 infrastructure, which is what, um, OCI is built on, um, is super high performance and, um, is able to provide higher performance for less cost. And you know, particularly for for big companies who are training models, who have a lot of inference, um, that's pretty attractive. I I want to get you to, um, explain a little bit more on that through the lens of something you wrote about in your preview note for these Oracle numbers. Um, you talk to a lot of folks, um, do a lot of channel checks. And you said OCI, um, you heard from an industry source is quote not busy trying to build GPUs, is setting up some very impressive clusters and delivering on what these high maintenance customers require. What what put all what does that mean? What is the point of all that? The point of all that is, you know, the three big hyperscalers, obviously, are Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. And Oracle is, um, you know, up and coming, but it's number four. And all of those hyperscalers as they, uh, provide, um, training and inference for for AI are using an enormous amount of Nvidia chips. And they're all designing their own chips in order to reduce that dependent on Nvidia, that dependence on Nvidia. Oracle is not taking that approach. Oracle instead is, um, just focusing on building the best data centers that they can to provide the best performance at the best price, and they're not trying to build their own chips. So they're very focused on just solving their customer's partner, and also, you know, that endears them to Nvidia, of course. So their partnership with Nvidia is really tight. Uh Pat, I I believe Oracle is both investor and and I think also technology partner for that Stargate project. How should investors think about what what that could mean for Larry Ellison's company looking forward financially and strategically? Yeah. Well, so Stargate, you know, just as a reminder, is, um, a massive AI infrastructure initiative where you have, um, SoftBank, OpenAI, Oracle, and then you have Microsoft and Nvidia as the technology partners. And initially, it was they were talking about $100 billion investment, and then, you know, over time that was potentially going to go to as five as as high as, um, $500 billion. So the the the real benefit that Oracle is going to reap there is, um, way more bookings for providing that AI infrastructure services as these data centers are getting built. The first one, which is a massive, um, a massive footprint in Texas. Um, and I think when they gave you that guidance talking about how RPO can double again, uh, my guess is we'll hear on the call that Stargate is part of that. You mentioned the call, Pat. Let's say you have the opportunity to ask Mr. Ellison or or Miss Safra Katz a question or two. What what would be top of mind for you? So this may not be the number one thing that investors care about, but you know, I'm also I'm I'm I'm a dad. I have four kids. And, um, I would love to hear, uh, Larry's point of view on what's going to happen to jobs for our children in in our society as more and more, um, of these AI, um, uh, algorithms and and applications are able to do more and more of the jobs that that humans did, uh, historically. And you know, that's something that the anthropic CEO's been talking about lately, too. I I think that's that's basically the biggest question facing our society today. And I would love to actually hear Mr. Ellison's take on that. Pat, as always, sir, great to have you on the show. Thank you. All right. Thank you for having me.",

        "content": "Intel(INTC-6.32%)stock saw a day of big sell-offs in Wednesday's daily session. The chip company's share price closed out the day down 6.3% due to concerns that competitive pressures are mounting. Intel's valuation sank today following news about a product thatNvidiais readying that could compete with Intel in the central processing unit (CPU) space. Meanwhile, another report suggested thatAdvanced Micro Deviceswill continue gaining market share from Intel in the server CPU market. Image source: Getty Images. According to recent leaks, Nvidia is gearing up to launch two accelerated processing unites (APUs) for the consumer market that would combine a CPU and a graphics processing unit (GPU) into single products. Based on some limited perimeters, some leaked benchmark scores for the more advanced of Nvidia's rumored APUs point to performance that tops a comparable offering from Intel. Real-world performance may be more favorable in Intel in many situations, but moves from Nvidia to play a bigger role in the CPU space could still create significant competitive pressures. Making matters worse, a new report from Mercury Research suggests that AMD has continued to rapidly increase its market share in the server CPU space. According to Mercury's report, AMD managed to capture 40% of the CPU market for servers in this year's first quarter -- and it's poised to match Intel in market share sometime next year. Intel's path forward looks complicated. The company has missed out on the early growth market for artificial intelligence (AI) GPUs, and it's facing pressure in both the consumer and enterprise CPU markets. While the company's chip foundry unit has the potential to be an important national resource for the U.S., it remains to be seen whether its next-gen semiconductor fabrication platform will actually attract substantial interest from third parties seeking manufacturing services for their AI chip designs. Intel stock could surge if there are signs that its turnaround strategy is yielding results, but there's a lot of uncertainty on the table right now.",

Oracle shares jumped close to 7% in after-hours trading. The stock was up about 6% for 2025 through Wednesday's close. In its fiscal fourth quarter, revenue grew 11% year-over-year to $15.9 billion, above the analyst consensus. Adjusted net income of $4.88 billion, or $1.70 per share, rose from $4.61 billion, or $1.63 per share, in the year-ago quarter, also beating estimates. The gains came as cloud infrastructure revenue jumped 52% to $3 billion, making it Oracle's fastest-growing segment, though the figure was slightly short of Wall Street estimates. CEO Safra Catz said Oracle expects cloud infrastructure growth to increase from 50% in fiscal 2025 to more than 70% in fiscal 2026. Analysts had called for growth of 62%, according to Visible Alpha. \"FY25 was a very good year\u2014but we believe FY26 will be even better as our revenue growth rates will be dramatically higher,\" said Catz. \"Oracle is well on its way to being not only the world's largest cloud application company\u2014but also one of the world's largest cloud infrastructure companies,\" Catz added.",

        "content": "Major U.S. equities indexes ended the midweek session slightly lower. Stocks failed to extend their rally even as the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) report showed alighter-than-expected uptick in inflationin May, while the U.S. and China announced aframework for implementing a trade deal. The S&P 500 traded in positive territory for much of the day but lost steam on Wednesday afternoon. It closed with a loss of 0.3%, snapping a streak of three straight winning sessions. The Nasdaq was down 0.5%, while the Dow finished just a point below Tuesday's closing level. After securing the S&P 500'stop performance in the previous session, Intel (INTC) shares gave back most of their gains on Wednesday, tumbling 6.5% to record the steepest daily drop in the benchmark index. This week'svolatility for Intel stockcame as trade talks between the U.S. and China boosted hopes for less onerous semiconductor export restrictions. Meanwhile, the chipmaker remains in the midst of a major restructuring effort under CEO Lip-Bu Tan, who has been focused on cutting costs through workforce reductions, divestitures, and other initiatives since entering the role in March. Shares of steelmakers came under pressure following reports that the U.S. and Mexico are negotiating to scale back or cancel President Donald Trump's 50% tariff on steel imports up to a certain volume. The North American neighbors are reportedly exploring a quota system that would allow a specific amount of the metal to enter the U.S. from Mexico duty-free or at lower rates, with excess amounts subject to the full 50% levy. Nucor (NUE) shares lost 6.1%. Lockheed Martin (LMT) shares dropped 4.3% after reports indicated that the U.S. Department of Defense is cutting down on its orders for the aerospace and defense manufacturer's F-35 fighter jets. Delays involving a technological upgrade have hampered the finalization of contracts for the F-35. Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) jumped 5%, climbing the most of any S&P 500 stock on Wednesday, as investors continue to evaluate the entertainment giant's recently announced plan tosplit its studio operations and TV businessinto two separate companies. The stock has been volatile since the announcement, and uncertainties about the strategy remain. Starbucks (SBUX) shares jolted 4.3% higher on Wednesday. The coffee giant announced thelaunch of Green Dot Assist, a virtual assistant powered by generative artificial intelligence (AI) that is designed to help baristas with in-store functions, from learning to make drinks to troubleshooting maintenance issues. The company's CEO also said that Starbucks would accelerate its rollout of an updated staffing model across its stores and noted that the company has garnered significant interest regarding a possible sale of its stake in its China business. Shares of GE Vernova (GEV), the energy technology company that spun off from General Electric in 2024, surged 3.9% after Bank of America boosted its price target on the stock. Analysts highlighted their expectations for growing electricity demand in the U.S. over the next 10 years. They noted that GE Vernova could be well-positioned to capitalize on its natural gas turbine market strength. BofA also pointed to upside potential for GE Vernova's electrification business, anticipating strong demand for grid reliability equipment. Broadcom (AVGO) shares gained 3.4%. In results released last week, the chipmaker reported record quarterly revenue, driven by a boom in AI semiconductors, prompting numerous analysts to raise their price targets on the stock. However, Broadcom issued a muted forecast for the current quarter, citing potential softness in its server storage, wireless, and industrial businesses, and its shares initially moved lower in the wake of the report. Despite these challenges, Broadcom expects AI revenue growth to remain robust, saying it could hit $5.1 billion in the fiscal third quarter.",

        "content": "Tesla(TSLA0.07%)is primarily known for two things: electric vehicles (EV) andenergy storage. For years, however, the company's eccentric CEO Elon Musk has been talking about a vision for the company that's rooted in artificial intelligence (AI). Specifically, Musk wants to parlay Tesla's automobile business into a full-fledged robotaxi operation. The prospects of Tesla disrupting ride-hailing, delivery services, and even car rental businesses has investors excited. But just how real is the opportunity? According toNvidiaCEO Jensen Huang,who appears to be a fan of Musk already, Tesla's autonomous driving ambitions are very real. Let's dig into some recent commentary from Huang that should have Tesla bulls cheering. During an April 2024 earnings call, Musk made an interesting point comparing the evolution of automobiles to that of cellphones. He described how the release of the iPhone and Android devices served as an existential shift in the mobile phone business, essentially turning flip phones into relics. Musk went on to predict that \"all cars will need to be smart cars\" in the future. By \"smart car,\" Musk means cars that are capable of driving themselves. Essentially, he is saying that autonomous driving is the future of the automotive industry, and if legacy manufacturers such asFordandGeneral Motorsdon't catch up to what Tesla is developing through its full self-driving software, then \"licensing becomes not optional.\" During an interview with Yahoo! Finance, Huang appeared to echo Musk's sentiment that all cars will eventually be leveragingautonomous drivingtechnology. But the real kicker is what Huang said about Tesla, declaring the company is \"far ahead\" of the competition. pic.twitter.com/DryiuFJDof  Two of the biggest Tesla bulls on Wall Street are equity research analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities and Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood. WithTesla's robotaxi launchreportedly on the horizon, Ives got investors excited when he recently declared the \"golden age\" of autonomous driving has arrived. Perhaps unsurprisingly,Ives also raised his price target to $500 for Tesla stock, implying nearly 53% upside from the stock's closing price on June 10. ConsideringAlphabet's Waymo already has the lead in robotaxis, combined with existing footprints in the ride-hailing industry fromUberandLyft, Tesla would appear to have an uphill battle when it comes to acquiring customers and scaling its own autonomous vehicle fleet. Nevertheless, Wood appears to be even more bullish than Ives. The Ark Invest founder recently doubled down on her optimistic case for Tesla with afive-year share price target of $2,600! Image source: Getty Images. Tesla has long been a stock that exhibits out-of-the-ordinary behavior. What I mean by that is measuring Tesla based on traditional valuation metrics such as price-to-sales (P/S) or price-to-earnings (P/E) has rarely been useful. The reason is because Tesla stock tends to move based on narratives and less so on concrete financials. Over the last month, shares of Tesla have gained roughly 9% as of June 10. However, within that brief period, the stock had climbed as high as 22% and declined as much as 5%. This is an extreme range of volatility, even for Tesla. Tesla stock started to tick higher throughout May as Musk announced that he's moving on from his public sector duties at theDepartment of Government Efficiency(DOGE). Investors were happy to hear this as they assumed Musk would refocus on Tesla, a business that's been stagnant for over a year now. On top of that, the expected robotaxi rollout in June likely attracted some investors as well. But over the last week, Tesla stock took a nosedive at one point due to a very public feud between Musk and President Donald Trump -- specifically regarding disagreements the two have on Trump's new spending bill. Just weeks ago, it seemed theupside from the robotaxi launch was already priced into Tesla stock, but now, you could argue this is an opportunity to buy the dip. With this much volatility and so much of it hanging on the robotaxi, I'd wait and see how the launch goes. Long-term scaling of the robotaxi business will require regulatory approvals, making Musk's political feuds all the more relevant. While it's tempting to scoop up shares of Tesla based on positive talking points from prominent figures such as Huang, Ives, and Wood, there's just too many unknowns surrounding the company right now to make it a prudent buy at these prices.",

        "content": "Nvidiahas been at the forefront of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution thanks to its powerful graphics processing units (GPUs), which have allowed companies and governments around the globe to train and deploy AI models and applications. The semiconductor giant literally kicked off the AI craze with its A100 GPUs, which were used to trainChatGPT. Since then, multiple AI models from several companies have been trained and brought into production with Nvidia's chips. In fact, Nvidia continues to dominate the AI chip market even now, establishing a big lead over its rivals. Nvidia's AI-fueled growth has powered a massive surge in its stock price in the past three years. The stock remains a solid bet even after its phenomenal run thanks to the huge addressable market it is serving. However, there is another company that has the potential to dominate its industry -- just like Nvidia does -- thanks to AI. Let's take a closer look at that name and see why it could turn out to be a solid addition to your portfolio. Image source: Getty Images. Nvidia has left little room for other chipmakers to make a dent in the AI chip market. So, investors looking for another company with the ability to become a leading player in its market and deliver healthy stock price upside in the long run should considerMeta Platforms(META-1.19%)for their portfolios. That's because Meta is using AI to corner a bigger share of the lucrative digital advertising market. The social media giant has been able to substantially increase advertisers' returns on ad dollars spent with the help of its AI tools. Last month, Meta pointed out that its AI-focused advertising tools are driving a 22% improvement in returns on ad spending for advertisers. Every dollar spent by advertisers in the U.S. on the company's AI ad tools is generating an impressive return of $4.52. Not surprisingly, Meta plans to enable advertisers to fully create and optimize ad campaigns with AI by the end of 2026. Such a move means that brands and advertisers won't have to go through agencies to purchase ad inventories and plan their campaigns, as all of this would be handled by AI. As a result, it won't be surprising to see smaller brands and companies that lack the budgets to hire marketing agencies flocking to use Meta's AI tools to reach their audience. Even bigger brands could directly go to Meta to further enhance their returns on ad dollars spent. All this could pave the way for stronger growth in Meta's revenue and earnings. The company's top line increased by 16% in the first quarter of 2025, while its adjusted earnings increased at a better pace of 37%. The stronger bottom-line growth can be attributed to a 10% increase in the average price per ad delivered by Meta last quarter. Ad impressions also increased by 5% year over year, indicating that there was an increase in the number of times users viewed ads on its platform. A big reason why Meta can keep attracting more advertising dollars is because of its massive daily active user base of 3.43 billion across its various apps. With AI helping brands and advertisers improve audience targeting, there is a good chance that it may be able to clock strong growth in the average price per ad and the number of ad impressions it delivers in the future. This could eventually help Meta Platforms to continue growing at a faster pace than the digital ad market and its peers. According to eMarketer, global digital ad revenue increased by 12% last year and is forecast to jump another 10% this year. Meta's 2024 revenue increased by 22%, and its performance in the first quarter of 2025 suggests that it is on track to outgrow the industry once again. So, it is evident that AI is helping Meta Platforms become a bigger player in the digital ad market, and management is confident that this could lead to remarkable growth in the long run. Meta is expected to finish 2025 with $187 billion in revenue, according to consensus estimates. AI is expected to contribute $2 billion to $3 billion of that revenue this year, according to the company's internal estimates. But by 2035, Meta sees its AI revenue ranging anywhere between $460 billion and a whopping $1.4 trillion. While that's a very wide range and an ambitious target, especially at the high end, investors would do well to note that the overall digital ad market is expected to exceed $1.5 trillion in revenue by 2035, according to third-party estimates. So, there is a good chance that Meta could indeed capture a huge share of this lucrative end-market opportunity on offer considering that it has been gaining ground in the digital ad space. So, investors looking for an AI stock that has the potential to generate Nvidia-like returns in the long run would do well to buy Meta Platforms right away as it is trading at an attractive 27 times earnings, a discount to the tech-ladenNasdaq-100index's earnings multiple of 30.",
