        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. is set to inject $10 billion capital to its overseas unit to shore up its forex hedging operations, its biggest such move to counter a volatile local currency. Most Read from Bloomberg Bezos Wedding Draws Protests, Soul-Searching Over Tourism in Venice US Renters Face Storm of Rising Costs US State Budget Wounds Intensify From Trump, DOGE Policy Shifts Commuters Are Caught in Johannesburg's Taxi Feuds as Transit Lags Mapping the Architectural History of New York\u2019s Chinatown TSMC Global Ltd., the wholly-owned unit of the world\u2019s largest contract chipmaker, has approved a plan to increase its capital by issuing $10 billion worth new shares to its parent to help it reduce foreign exchange hedging costs, the company said in a statement. It\u2019s the third such deal since 2024, and by far the largest. They occurred during periods when the Taiwan dollar tended to appreciate. The moves grant TSMC Global \u2014 the vehicle responsible for managing overseas investments and hedging \u2014 more capital flexibility in managing exchange rate risks. The capital injection is for general investments, mainly bank deposits and bonds, according to a separate statement from Taiwan\u2019s Department of Investment Review earlier. The purpose was for TSMC to shift its own foreign exchange holdings to the unit to help with hedging costs, the statement said. Recent strength in the Taiwan dollar has caused worries in Taipei about the economy\u2019s heavy reliance on exports. In May, the currency notched its biggest single-day gain since the 1980s, spurring calls from the central bank to curb speculation. The cost of hedging swings has surged this year, with one-year implied volatility for the local currency hitting the highest since 2011 on Wednesday. \u201cGenerally speaking, the heightened forex volatility would mean that banks may be adjusting their margin requirements,\u201d said Philip McNicholas, Asia sovereign strategist at Robeco based in Singapore. \u201cIssuing new shares, and bringing in an immediate cash injection, may help companies manage the margin requirements on both existing and new hedges.\u201d \u201cThe US dollar cash can also be useful for companies\u2019 overseas operations, which could also require consistent hedging,\u201d McNicholas added. TSMC, the main chipmaker to Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp., is by far the island\u2019s biggest company and exporter because the majority of its production is domestic. A stronger Taiwan dollar hurts exporters because the US dollars they earn from sales abroad would translate into less of the local currency, or they would need to raise their prices overseas and risk denting demand. In June, Chief Executive Officer C. C. Wei told shareholders the company\u2019s operating margin has fallen several percentage points because of a stronger local currency. \u201cTypically, one of the means of such a move is for natural hedging, where a corporate can match US dollar revenue with US dollar liabilities,\u201d said Christopher Wong, senior foreign-exchange strategist at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd. \u201cIt can also fund their US asset and expansion plans with less FX conversion risk.\u201d Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek Inside Gap\u2019s Last-Ditch, Tariff-Addled Turnaround Push How to Steal a House Luxury Counterfeiters Keep Outsmarting the Makers of $10,000 Handbags Apple Test-Drives Big-Screen Movie Strategy With F1 Ken Griffin on Trump, Harvard and Why Novice Investors Won\u2019t Beat the Pros \u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) shares closed at a record high on Wednesday, pushing the chipmaker back to the top spot on the list of the world's most valuable companies. The move, whichpropelled the company\u2019s market capitalizationto nearly $3.77 trillion, above Microsoft's (MSFT) $3.66 trillion, came after CEO Jensen Huang reportedly said at the tech behemoth\u2019s annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday that the company has a multitrillion-dollar growth opportunity in AI and robotics. The stock has also received a boost from favorable Wall Street commentary, with analysts pointing out that the chipmaker stands to benefit from growingsovereign AI demandas countries use the technology to meet critical healthcare, defense, industrial, financial andcybersecurityneeds. Nvidia shares jumped more than 4% Wednesday to close at $154.31.

Below, we analyze thetechnicalson Nvidia\u2019s chart to identify major price levels that investors will likely be watching. After climbing back above the200-day moving average (MA)last month, Nvidia shares trended higher within arising wedgebefore breaking out above the pattern in Wednesday\u2019s trading session. Moreover, therelative strength indexconfirms bullish price momentum, though the indicator also cautionsoverboughtconditions with a reading above the 70 threshold, potentially leading to short-termprofit-taking. It\u2019s also worth noting that the 50-day MA sits on the precipice of crossing above the 200-day MA to form a bullishgolden cross, a chart signal pointing to the start of a new move higher. Let\u2019s applytechnical analysisto Nvidia\u2019s chart to forecast where the price may be headed and also identify majorsupport levelsworth monitoring during futurepullbacksin the stock. Investors can forecast how a new move higher in Nvidia shares may play out by using bars pattern analysis, a technique that analyzes priortrendson the chart to make future price projections. When applying the analysis to Nvidia\u2019s chart, we take the bullish price bars that preceded the rising wedge pattern and reposition them from Wednesday\u2019sbreakoutpoint. This projects an upsideprice targetof around $205 and indicates the trend may last until late July if a similar move higher takes shape. During profit-taking in the stock, it\u2019s initially worth monitoring the $150 level. This area, which could flip from priorresistanceto future support, may attract buying interest near Wednesday's breakout area and a trendline stretching back to last November. Finally, a close below this major technical level opens the door to a potentialbull trap, a trading event that could see Nvidia shares fall to lower support around $130.

The broader S&P 500 and the Nasdaq are inching closer to their peaks as Wall Street celebrates cooling Middle East tensions. Investors are betting that the President Trump-backed cease-fire agreement between Israel and Iran leads to a sustained peace. Confident that a major conflict will be avoided, Wall Street finally sent market-moving technology stocks such as Nvidia to new highs, following the rally that began in early April. Cooling inflation, trade deals, and the potential for strong second-quarter earnings provide a bullish backdrop heading into July. Now it\u2019stime for investors to buy strong technology stocks set to benefit from the artificial intelligence boom and other key trends heading into July.

Rockwell is collaborating with NvidiaNVDAto integrate advanced AI and robotics technologies into its industrial automation solutions, enhancing manufacturing efficiency and enabling smarter, autonomous operations. The Milwaukee, Wisconsin-based company topped our Q2 FY25 earnings estimate in early May and provided upbeat guidance in the face of tariff concerns. ROK\u2019s upbeat EPS revisions earn it a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Image Source: Zacks Investment Research The company\u2019s outlook signals that it is at the bottom of its current business cycle, with it projected to return to strong earnings and sales growth in the final quarter of its FY25. Rockwell is projected to boost its adjusted earnings by 16% in FY26 on 7% higher sales (following marginal projected EPS growth in FY25 and slightly lower sales). ROK has jumped 13% in 2025 to more than triple Tech. Its recent charge pushed it to the top end of the trading range it\u2019s been stuck in for the past several years and helped it complete the bullish golden cross, where its shorter-dated 50-day moving average climbs above its 200-day. The stock also held its ground at its very long-term 50-month moving average.

        "content": "NVIDIA Corp.NVDA \u2014 the undisputed global leader of the generative artificial intelligence (AI)-powered graphical processing units (GPUs) \u2014 regained the crown of the world\u2019s most valuable company in terms of market capital. On June 25, the stock price of NVDA closed at an all-time high of $154.31, with a market capital of $3.763 trillion, surpassing one of its major clientMicrosoft Corp.\u2019s MSFT market capital of around $3.66 trillion. NVIDIA recorded its previous all-time high of $149.41 at January end. Thereafter, the stock fell significantly due to the unveiling of the low-cost Chinese DeepSeek AI platform, the Trump administration\u2019s decision to stop the export of NVDA\u2019s high-end H20 AI processor to China and global turmoil related to trade after President Trump imposed reciprocal tariffs. The stock price recorded its recent low in early April. From there, it surged nearly 80% with a year-over-year gain of more than 15%. The recent rally of NVDA is highly commendable despite the fact that the company warned last month that export restrictions would cost it $8 billion in sales and a $4.5 billion inventory write off. NVIDIA is no longer counting any sales from China. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research NVIDIA reaffirmed its commitment to continued innovation, evolution and execution. After the successful execution of Hopper GPUs, NVDA\u2019s Blackwell GPUs have already seen a record high units sold to cloud providers. NVIDIA is expected to unveil Blackwell Ultra \u2014 in the second half of 2025 and begin shipping of Vera Rubin \u2014 in 2026. In addition, the company decided that it will announce its roadmap for Rubin Next \u2014 to be introduced in 2027 and Feynman AI chips in 2028. NVIDIA is supported by an extremely bullish demand scenario. Four of the \u201cmagnificent 7\u201d stocks have decided to invest a massive $325 billion in 2025 as capital expenditure for AI-infrastructure development. This marks a significant 46% year-over-year increase in capital spending on the AI ecosystem. Apart from Microsoft, other giant customers areAlphabet Inc.GOOGL,Meta Platforms Inc.META andAmazon.com Inc.AMZN. This huge spending on AI infrastructure will dramatically change the world in the next five years in fields like hyperscale automation, robotics, healthcare, energy, materials, financials and cybersecurity. Research firm Oppenheimer estimated that the total addressable global sovereign AI market could be a massive $1.5 trillion. The major innovation for NVDA\u2019s new chipsets is a qualitative shift from pureplay generative AI models to reasoning AI models. NVIDIA\u2019s CEO Jensen Huang, said that contrary to the market\u2019s belief that DeepSeek is a major threat to NVDA\u2019s high-cost chips, it has actually opened a huge growth opportunity for his company. According to Huang, \u201cDeepSeek\u2019s R1 AI model the first open-sourced reasoning model. This reasoning AI consumes 100 times more compute than a non-reasoning AI.\u201d OpenAI's o1 and Alphabet\u2019s Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking are also reasoning models. Huang said that AI chips with faster speed will be the best option for companies that opt for reasoning AI-based infrastructure to save costs and maximize returns. In this regard, NVDA\u2019s upcoming Blackwell Ultra chips are expected to provide data centers 50 times more revenue than its Hopper systems, buoyed by their superfast AI servicing capabilities to multiple users. Aside from the robust business of data centers and gaming, the automobile industry, especially the self-driving and new energy vehicles, is turning out to be the next catalyst. NVIDIA unveiled new AI infrastructure for robotics. In the last reported first-quarter of fiscal 2026, automotive revenues jumped 72% year over year to $567 million. NVDA is expecting automotive segment revenue to cross $5 billion in fiscal 2026. CEO Jensen Huang is highly optimistic as this business could become a multitrillion-dollar opportunity in the future. NVIDIA has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 51.4% and 42.1%, respectively, for the current year (ending January 2026). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1.7% in the last 30 days. It has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 25.2% and 31.8%, respectively, for next year (ending January 2027). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for next-year earnings has improved 0.4% in the last seven days. NVDA has a long-term (3-5 years) EPS growth rate of 28.2%, significantly above the S&P 500 Index\u2019s 12.6% growth rate.

        "content": "Saving for retirement is arguably one of the important financial goals in your life. That\u2019s because it impacts your financial security and quality of life, especially after you leave the workforce. Although it\u2019s never too late to start saving at any age, the earlier you start, the better for various reasons. Not only do you secure your financial independence, but you also benefit from compound growth, protect yourself from inflation, and don\u2019t have to rely on Social Security as your sole source of income. It\u2019s important to start saving for retirement regardless of your age. But the earlier you start, the better. That\u2019s because the longer you wait, the more money you\u2019ll have to save. As you save, it\u2019s important to have a focused goal in mind, even if it\u2019s to end up withfinancial independence, according toAndr\u00e9 Small, financial planner at A Small Investment. \u201cEven for younger\u00a0clients where\u00a0retirement is 35 years away, I focus on what the client values\u00a0most and let that guide their plan and savings strategy for retirement,\u201d he says. \u201cSo, yes, start saving early and often, but also do it with\u00a0a plan that aligns with your values and desired retirement.\u201d Starting your retirement savings plan early gives you many benefits: There are certainbenchmarksthat experts suggest investors stick to when it comes to their retirement planning. The chart below highlights how much people should consider saving by their age group: So, if you\u2019re 50, you should be saving 3.5 to 5.5 times your salary for retirement. That benchmark gets wider the closer you get to retirement, As such, it\u2019s important to decidewhat age you want to retire. \u201cSomeone in their 50s should have a plan in place as they approach their desired retirement year,\u201d says Small. \u201cThe 50s is the perfect time to evaluate values, goals, and how they align with where someone is currently.\u201d While you may not have time on your side, that doesn\u2019t mean you should delay saving. Small says you should have a plan in place as you approach your desired retirement year. Being in your 50s is the perfect time to evaluate your values and goals. Keep in mind that you should make adjustments to that benchmark if you\u2019re single, married with one income, or married with two incomes. According to Small: Make sure you have anemergency fund. This is money set aside in a liquid account, such as a high-yield savings or money market account. You should have at least three to six months\u2019 worth of expenses saved. There are a lot of different factors that you\u2019ll have to consider when you\u2019re approaching or in your 50s. For instance, make sure you review and optimize your investment strategy. Remember, your portfolio returns should not be compared at this point in your investment career to theS&P 500or any other index, for that matter. \u201cReturns should be assessed based on what\u2019s needed to support your retirement income goal,\u201d says Small. That\u2019s because your situation means you may not need to take on additional stock market risk to obtain your desired retirement lifestyle. Here are a few other things you should consider as you head toward retirement. Small says you should take advantage of employer-sponsored retirement plans, especially if your company offers anemployer match. This is money your company contributes on your behalf based on how much you set aside. Put simply, it\u2019s free money you give away if you don\u2019t contribute. Remember, 401(k) plan contribution limits are $23,500 in 2025 with an additional $7,500 if you are 50 or older. And don\u2019t forget to invest in traditionalindividual retirement accounts (IRAs). These plans allow you to contribute as much as $8,000 if you are 50 or older in 2025. The same limits apply forRoth IRAs, but you must meet certain income thresholds. The table below highlights the income qualifications for 2025: Look for opportunities to cut back on yourdebt. Take a proactive approach to tackle your debt. You can do this by prioritizing high-interest debt, such as credit cards and personal loans. Use debt repayment strategies like thedebt avalancheordebt snowball methodto pay off your debts faster. Considerdownsizingafter you\u2019ve turned 50, especially if your kids have left home. Moving to a smaller home can reduce your living expenses and free up your monthly bills so you can save more money for retirement. Cut unnecessary expenses, such as unused streaming services and memberships. Eliminate any nonessential spending like that extra night out. Remember, making small sacrifices can help you in the long run. You may have to make mindful changes about when you\u2019ll retire. Be realistic. If you haven\u2019t started saving for retirement, you probably can\u2019t expect to be financially independent and live a lavish lifestyle solely onSocial Securityat age 65, so you may have to delay retiring. You may also want to consider the following: Healthcareis one of the biggest concerns for retirees, which is why you need to make plans about the cost of your medical care even before you leave the workforce. \u201cKeep in mind that any individual\u2019s health situation is unique, and they may need to plan for additional healthcare costs in retirement,\u201d says Small. Remember that people are living longer. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the averagelife expectancyin the United States was 78.4 years (75.8 for males and 81.1 for females) as of 2023.With Medicare, you\u2019ll have out-of-pocket costs forco-pays, co-insurance, premiums, anddeductibles, so you must set aside cash to cover these expenses. Everyone\u2019s financial situation is different, so not everyone may have the chance to start saving for retirement early. But make sure you take every opportunity you get. While the points listed above serve as a general guideline for people in their 50s, it\u2019s always a good idea to sit down with a financial professional to map out a plan and lay down a solid foundation for your retirement planning.",

        "header": "These 5 Unique Indicators Can Give You an Edge When Analyzing the Crypto Market",
        "content": "Cryptocurrency investments are becoming more popular today, especially with Bitcoin\u2019s recent all-time high and the U.S. government\u2019s pro-crypto stance.If you are considering diversifying your portfolio,investing in cryptocurrenciesmight be worth considering. However, like any asset class, crypto investment decisions are better informed when they are reinforced by relevant data and an understanding of current market sentiment, especially since crypto can be more volatile than many asset classes. Two key indicators that can help you make more informed crypto investment decisions are on-chain metrics and blockchain-native data. These indicators provide you with real-time market information, which is largely unavailable to retail investors who trade more traditional assets, like stocks and ETFs. Those data are based on blockchain technology, a novel technology where every transaction made on a decentralized distributed ledger is available to everyone. Publicblockchaintransactions are visible to everyone, making on-chain indicators a goldmine of insight into such trends as rising or falling activity. They can offer investors a view of the market\u2019s pulse. This data is usually free and doesn't require complex analysis, as several crypto analytics platforms like Dune, Nansen, and Glassnode put these metrics into a format you can easily understand. However, it is not advisable to look at every blockchain-native indicator; stick to those that mean the most to you. Those can be the indicators that have a significant impact on the market. In this article, you can learn about the metrics that matter most and how to interpret them for crypto trading and investing. Cryptocurrency is stored in wallets, which have addresses. Whenever a new user comes on-chain, they create a wallet to handle their crypto. New addresses generated tend to be positively correlated with an increase in the coin\u2019s price as seen in the graphic below, which shows a general correlation betweenBitcoin\u2019s priceand the number of new crypto wallet addresses between over the roughly 10 years ended in late May 2025: These new addresses show increased activity and adoption of a blockchain network, which could indicate growing bullish momentum. Likewise, a rising number of active addresses over any time frame shows potential demand for that cryptocurrency. Be careful of relying solely on this metric, as it can be easily manipulated. Airdrop farmers can create thousands of spam wallets, which might appear genuine on on-chain metric platforms. A crypto whale is an entity that holds a large amount of a particular cryptocurrency and is capable of influencing a coin\u2019s price by moving it among wallets, making it look like authentic, robust trading volume generated by many unrelated investors. Whales are not determined by a particular amount, but by what percentage of a coin\u2019s circulating supply they hold. For example, only four addresses hold 100,000 or more BTC, worth $66 billion as of June 17, 2025, according to BitInfoCharts.Sudden moves from wallets with huge holdings can quickly cause a spike or plunge in price, disrupting and even changing the current market trend. Whale wallets moving their holdings to centralized exchanges are likely a sell signal as they begin a distribution phase. You can set up alerts on these wallets once you identify them and get instant notifications of any significant activity they take that might impact the market. Acryptocurrency exchangeis an online platform where you can sell or buy crypto. If data shows cryptocurrency is flowing into exchanges (which are called exchange inflows), it could be a strong distribution sign, showing that investors are selling off their assets. Conversely, exchange outflows suggest investors are moving assets tocold storage(which potentially is a bullish signal). You should monitor exchange inflows or outflows oftop exchangessuch asKrakenandCoinbase, as volume on smaller exchanges has a minimal impact on the general market. Miners, who enter transactions into a blockchain network, can directly impact the price of a cryptocurrency, especially in shorter time frames. Miners usually sell a part of their crypto rewards to cover their running costs. But if they are selling more than usual, it is likely a bearish signal. Important data points to look for are miner inflows, outflows, and reserves. Since 2024, BTC miners have sold off more of their holdings as the price increased.That profit-taking showed a negative correlation between reserves and price as miners liquidated their rewards amid the rally. Halvingevents are another variable you should keep tabs on. Miners usually sell off their BTC holdings after a halving event (which happens every four years) as their rewards get smaller with each successful halving. Dormant wallets are cryptocurrency wallets that show no recorded activity for an extended time (think five years and longer). Whenever these wallets suddenly become active, they spark curiosity among traders, especially if the wallets have huge crypto holdings or were last used during the early mining days. When these wallets liquidate their assets, it could be a bearish signal and indicate a change of sentiment in the cryptocurrency in question. But if they transfer their assets to a new address without selling, it could be a strong bullish signal. (The identity of a wallet address owner is not readily shown, but a platform can confirm a transfer.) In 2023, three dormant wallets suddenly transferred $230 million of Bitcoin, after its price had been bullish two weeks prior.Per TradingView data, BTC surged after the wallet event, closing the year with almost $9,000 per coin in gains. On-chain indicators provide unique insights about the cryptocurrency market, which you can use to make informed decisions without having to rely solely on traditionaltechnical analysis tools. While on-chain indicators provide a way to see market moves in real-time, they should not act as the sole basis of your investing decisions.Fundamentalsand high-impact news events can also cause big moves in the market, overriding the intended impact of these indicators. Stick to indicators that have a significant impact on the market and remember to keep an eye out for fundamental and news events, too.",

        "header": "Curious How Interest Rates Impact Client Portfolios? Here Are 4 Insights to Know",
        "content": "Interest rates influence nearly every facet of our lives, from purchasing homes and cars to securing business loans. Because interest rates play a key role in portfolio performance, it\u2019s important to educate clients on how fluctuations impact various asset classes and to provide strategies to mitigate these changes. Here\u2019s what I\u2019m telling my clients. One of the most direct effects ofinterest ratesis observed in thebond market. When interest rates rise, existing bonds with lower yields become less attractive, leading to a price decline. Conversely, when rates fall, bond prices typically increase. If rates are expected to rise, consider shifting to shorter-duration bonds, which are less sensitive to changes. Review your portfolio every few months and adjust based on your financial goals and the interest rate outlook. Interest rates also play a crucial role in thestock market. Higher rates make existing debt and borrowing more expensive, which can lead to reduced capital expenditures and lowerprofit margins. This scenario may cause stock prices to decline, particularly for growth-oriented companies that rely heavily on borrowing. Conversely, lower interest rates can stimulate economic growth, resulting in higher corporate earnings and rising stock prices. You should regularly monitor rate policy, diversify portfolios with less sensitive sectors like consumer staples and utilities, and favor companies with low debt. Different sectors respond uniquely to changes in interest rates. For example, thereal estate sectoroften struggles when rates rise due to its reliance ondebt financing. Higher rates can increase costs and decrease demand. In contrast,financial institutions, such as banks, may benefit from rising rates, as they can lend at higher rates while borrowing at lower ones. Clients can better position their portfolios by understanding which sectors will likely thrive or falter in various interest rate environments. Given the unpredictable nature of interest rates,diversification becomes essential. Clients should consider a mix of asset classes, including equities, bonds, real estate, and commodities, to mitigate risks associated with interest rate fluctuations. Inflation-protected securities can also hedge against rising rates, helping to ensure that portfolios remain resilient. Interest rates can strongly affect portfolio performance. Long-term investor clients may focus on broader economic trends andcentral bank policies, whileshort-term tradersmust react swiftly to immediate rate changes. Whichever camp a person falls into, clients can better position themselves and adapt to a fluctuating economy by understanding their influence and adjusting accordingly.",

        "header": "Nvidia rally persists: What worries this analyst about AI trade",
        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) climbs higher, hitting fresh record highs. However, the artificial intelligence (AI) chipmaker and its \"Magnificent Seven\" peers have underperformed other AI-related names in the S&P 500 (^GSPC), like Palantir (PLTR), Vistra (VST), and Dell (DELL). Wall Street Horizon head of corporate event research, Christine Short, tells Market Domination hostJosh Lipton, Yahoo Finance anchorJulie Hyman, and Yahoo Finance Markets ReporterJosh Schaferthat it's competition with Chinese AI companies that she worries could threaten the AI play. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Dominationhere. Green all over the place, Christine, we just keep grinding higher here. What do you make of it? Yeah, look, investor appetite is there, right? AI enthusiasm has returned. We just talked about Nvidia. Um, I think there were some whispers today about is this, you know, signifying a bubble here? Is this .com 2.0 with Nvidia being at almost record highs here? And if you look at what analysts are saying, and I know we're going to hear from one, you know, that covers Nvidia here soon, um, no one's saying that this is overvalued. I think many are actually saying that we're still undervalued here on Nvidia because we haven't quite priced in AI and the impact on productivity. We heard from CEO of Salesforce today, Mark Benioff, saying that 30 to 50% of their workload is now done by AI. And we've seen a slew of companies cut, you know, positions because of AI, whether it be Salesforce or CrowdStrike, Klarna, so, or, or Duolingo, who's actually going to be more discreet about hiring because of AI. So I don't think we've, we've folded in the full impact. The one concern I have, and maybe it's not so much a concern, but what I'm watching is competition from Chinese AI companies. There was a great report in Datatrack Research earlier in the week that just showed the valuations are so much more appetizing on some of those Chinese AI names versus, you know, the US ones. And the returns have actually been higher for those names. So that's one area that I'm watching is, is the competition between us and those Chinese AI names. Josh, you know, Julie mentioned it briefly, but I want to get double tap on it. The mag 7 names, Josh, those giants, right? How have they been working? Yeah, yeah, Josh. So I have a visual representation over here on our big board, right, of sort of some of what Julie was talking about. And what I'm looking at here is just performance since the April 8th low. Uh, most of these stocks here are all in the top 20 of the S&P 500. They're all AI tied. So I looked at sort of an AI basket of stocks, right? You have Oracle, Broadcom, Dell, AMD, NRG, as Julie mentioned, Vistra, which is sort of an AI power play, and Palantir. What's interesting is all of the mag 7 have underperformed them, right? So Nvidia's up about 60% at a new high. Really the rest of these companies have come up about 25, 30% maybe from the bottom. Apple hasn't really gone anywhere. And Christine, I guess the question this sort of brings me to for you is just, is the next AI trade going to continue to be the broadening out of this trade into cloud computing, into energy, into some of the other chip names, or is that, is that sort of where it feels like this trade is headed as we go through kind of the second half of 25? Yeah, I think we, we are already seeing that broadening out. There's a lot of liquidity in the market, and I think what surprised me the most is how quickly we've rebounded from that April low. And it just goes to show the appetite, the enthusiasm amongst, you know, all of tech. So not just within the AI space, but there is liquidity there. There was cash on the sidelines for quite a while. And now, you know, many of those investors bought the dip, and now we're seeing it rip.",

Xbox content and services benefit from robust performance across third-party and first-party content offerings.The Zacks analyst expects that fiscal 2025 net sales will increase 13.7% compared to fiscal 2024. However, elevated operating expenses and Azure investments amid intensifying cloud competition remain concerns for the stakeholders.(You canread the full research report on Microsoft here >>>)Shares ofNVIDIAhave outperformed the Zacks Semiconductor - General industry over the past year (+24.5% vs. +20.8%). The company is benefiting from the strong growth of artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance and accelerated computing. The growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA\u2019s Hopper and Blackwell architectures is aiding data center revenues.Continued ramp-up of Ada RTX GPU workstations in the ProViz end market, following the normalization of channel inventory, is acting as a tailwind. Collaborations with over 320 automakers and tier-one suppliers are likely to advance its presence in the autonomous vehicles space.The Zacks analyst expects NVIDIA\u2019s revenues to witness a CAGR of 28.95% through fiscal 2026-2028. However, a limited supply of Blackwell and Ada GPUs could hinder its ability to meet demand.

The Zacks analyst expect NII to record a CAGR of 5.3% by 2027. Plans to open financial centers in new and existing markets and improve digital capabilities will aid the top line. We project total revenues to grow 5.8% in 2025.Nevertheless, the volatile nature of the trading business is a concern. Despite an impressive trading performance since 2022, it is expected to normalize going forward, thus hurting fee income growth. We project non-interest income to rise only 4.5% in 2025.Also, steady investments in the franchise will likely keep operating expenses elevated, thus hurting profitability. We expect total non-interest expenses to rise 3% this year.

The BKR 9000 is expanding across public safety verticals and the BK ONE SaaS platform adds high-margin, recurring revenue potential. A growing hardware-software ecosystem aims to boost the addressable market tenfold by 2027.Strong liquidity funds growth, but risks include federal revenue reliance, execution risk in SaaS adoption, margin pressure from tariffs and delays in mobile product launches.

The S&P 500 advanced 0.8%, ending the session three points below its record-high closing levelset in February. The Dow was up 0.9%, while the Nasdaq gained 1%. Enphase Energy (ENPH) stock secured Thursday's top performance in the S&P 500, skyrocketing 12.8%. The leap higher for shares of the solar microinverter manufacturer came as reports indicated Republicans in Congress wereconsidering changes to the budget billthat would maintain federal tax credits for residential rooftop solar installations. Shares of Enphase and other solar companies plunged in May after the House passed a version of the bill that stipulated tax credits for wind and solar projects would be eliminated by 2029. Copper prices pushed higher, boosted by a surge in imports to the U.S. ahead of proposed tariffs, resulting in a decline in inventories elsewhere, alongside strong demand from China. Analysts at Goldman Sachs predicted that prices for the industrial metal would continue to rise before reaching a 2025 peak in August. Shares of major copper producer Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) jumped 6.9% on Thursday. Albemarle (ALB) stock gained 5.6%. At an industry conference in Las Vegas, lithium producers noted that prices of the key battery ingredient remain depressed, despite ongoing increases in demand. Although observers suggested that oversupply will likely keep a lid on lithium prices over the coming years, producers have been making strides in reducing costs. Shares of Coinbase Global (COIN), operator of the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, advanced 5.5% after the stockreceived a significant price target boostfrom analysts at Bernstein. The firm pointed to the crypto platform's market dominance, with strength in trading, custody, and infrastructure, making Coinbase a \"one-stop\" shop for cryptocurrency financial services. The analysts also highlighted Coinbase's position as the only crypto-native company in the S&P 500, after joining the benchmark index in May. Equinix (EQIX) shares tumbled 9.6%, losing the most of any stock in the S&P 500. Thursday's drop extended losses posted in the prior session as the data center real estate investment trust (REIT) held its analyst day. Equinix forecasted tapering growth inadjusted funds from operations(AFFO) per share\u2014a key metric for REIT performance\u2014over the medium term. Analysts at BMO Capital Markets and Raymond James downgraded Equinix stock following the analyst day event, noting that capital-intensive plans to double capacity for AI workloads could weigh on earnings growth.

Most investors know, by now, that NVIDIA is the leading semiconductor maker of chips used in AI. The stock is again hitting all-time highs. But what else can you invest in if you want to own companies involved in the AI Revolution? There is no magic list of \u201cAI stocks\u201d especially if you\u2019re looking outside of the big caps.

The Zacks Rank is Zacks\u2019 stock system which looks for changes in analyst earnings estimates. It is a short-term trading recommendation of just 1 to 3 months. Rising earnings estimates usually indicate something \u201cgood\u201d is going on at a company.

        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) notchedanother record closeas investor enthusiasm around artificial intelligence (AI) continues to grow. Dave Mazza, CEO of Roundhill Investments, joins Asking for a Trend to break down Nvidia\u2019s momentum and why his new ETF is betting on humanoid robots as the next wave of AI innovation. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Asking for a Trendhere. Well we're seeing big moves in big tech with Nvidia hitting another record close today. For more, I want to bring in now Dave Mozza, chief executive officer at Round Hill Investments. Dave, it's great to see you. Let let's start there with Nvidia, Dave. Uh it's a name you know well. What do you make of the move off the April low we have seen there, Dave, and what do you see ahead for Jensen Huang's company? Yeah, look, Nvidia is showing its leadership uh through this market rally. And one of the reasons being is like there's a lot of resiliency with the AI trade. I think obviously the deep seek news which happened before the liberation day sell off, you know, brought a lot of skittishness to investors on on sort of the durability of that trade and actually more so the durability for companies like Nvidia to continue to power through that. Um but what we've seen is Nvidia is actually navigated well this environment. Certainly questions about that China market share that they're likely going to continue to lose. But now with the introduction of sovereign AI deals, I think Nvidia is showing that they have a lot more going for it than just sort of relying on what they've been doing with data centers and the hyperscalars in the US and even even a country as important or a market is important to it as like China. I also, Dave, I want to talk about this new ETF of yours which includes Nvidia and the focus is humanoid robots, Dave. And listen, robots we know, you know, it's not a new investing theme. It's been around for some time. So so why why launch this product now, Dave? Yeah, so it's interesting. Nvidia is actually the second largest holding uh in the portfolio. Not that they're making robots, but actually their Jets and AI uh is incredibly important uh for the growth of humanoid robotics. But to answer your point specifically on the why now is that we're seeing a convergence of trends um that are really we believe going to benefit robots, but particularly humanoid robotics. And one is this ongoing labor shortage, particularly for uh what are called the 3Ds of work. Um so that's dull work, that's dirty work, and dangerous work. Um so these this is work. Um dull work is repetitive work stocking shelves. We know that a humanoid robot can can do work of that nature. Of course dangerous work, um having a a robot do that as opposed to a human can be beneficial. Um and then dirty work, cleaning sludge and things of that nature. Um and so because of the power of AI, the computational capabilities plus the cost of those capabilities coming down, now's really the time that we're seeing sort of the potential for explosion of of humanoid robots. And also this idea of embedded intelligence embedded AI uh is coming and it's happening now with humanoid robotics. So we really think this is the next wave of AI growth.",

        "header": "Markets Surge on Tech Trade, \"Not Critical\" Tariffs",
        "content": "Thursday, June 26, 2025We started this trading week with some questions about the ability of the stock market to overcome some perceived major hurdles, a burgeoning war in the Middle East among them. Also, we\u2019ve gotten a large dollop of economic news thus far for the week, including this morning\u2019s Weekly Jobless Claims and Q1 GDP.And yet, nothing seems to faze market participants at this point and time. All markets except the small-cap Russell 2000 are now up for the year, with the S&P 500 a hair away from all-time highs back in February. The AI trade is back on to bolster tech stocks:NVIDIANVDA andPalantirPLTR, for instance, are at new record highs.And the White House press secretary earlier today said the July 9th deadline on reciprocal tariffs is \u201cnot critical,\u201d meaning, perhaps, in the minds of stock market investors, \u201cnon-existent.\u201d Basically, to whatever extent people were checking their calendars for trade-busting tariffs on the horizon, they\u2019re not doing so now \u2014 and it\u2019s a cause for celebration.Finally, worsening Continuing Jobless Claims, reported on this morning in this space, indicate a labor market that is noticeably weakening. While this is not a good sign economically overall, it may provide a way forward for the Fed to resume cutting interest rates, which it hasn\u2019t done all year. Lowering rates is key to unlocking plenty of other aspects of the economy that haven\u2019t performed quite so well as NVIDIA and Palantir, such as the housing market.  Reporting fiscal Q4 earnings after today\u2019s close isNikeNKE, and expectations were for a fairly dismal quarter. Fortunately, Nike beat on its bottom line for now the eighth-straight quarter with earnings of 14 cent per share, 2 cents better than anticipated. Revenues in the quarter came in at $11.1 billion. That said, these results pale in comparison to the year-ago figures of $1.01 per share on $12.61 billion in sales.Full-year revenues of $46.3 billion outpaced the Zacks consensus, but were still down -10% year over year. North America revenues were down -11% year over year, and that same -11% applied to all regions around the world combined. After gaining +2.8% on this strong day of regular trading, however, Nike shares are down -1.6% on this earnings news.  At some point, investors will again begin evaluating these market levels after such a convincing bull run. We\u2019re not sure if tomorrow will be the day, butPersonal Consumption Expenditures (PCE)data Friday morning may be a guide toward what to expect. Year over year projections are for a +2.3% read on PCE growth, +2.6% on core. These are near the Fed\u2019s inflation target of +2.0%, so any surprise closer to that mark may also be met with market exuberance.Questions or comments about this article and/or author?

        "content": "Investing in stocks isn't easy. You have to stay on top of multiple companies and predict how the future will unfold. While investors confidently hold on to stocks during bullish cycles, many of these same investors fold during bearish markets. Many Redditors discussed stocks they sold too early in arecent postthat is gaining momentum. Some Redditors lost out on massive, life-changing returns just by exiting reliable companies during corrections. \"If I waited a year, I would be 10x,\" one Redditor stated when talking about buyingNvidia(NASDAQ:NVDA) in 2020 and selling at breakeven in 2022. Don't Miss: GoSun's breakthrough rooftop EV charger already has 2,000+ units reserved \u2014become an investor in this $41.3M clean energy brand today. Invest early in CancerVax's breakthrough tech aiming to disrupt a $231B market.Back a bold new approach to cancer treatment with high-growth potential. One investor regretted sellingTesla(NASDAQ:TSLA) shares eight years ago. Another investor sympathized and said they also sold Tesla eight years ago, citing 10% daily swings as the main reason for exiting. Tesla was one of the biggest winners during the pandemic and has gone up by more than 1,000% over the past eight years. While some posts contained nothing more than people talking about their losses, this one contains a valuable lesson. If you invest in a company for the long run, you have to endure volatility. Sharp price swings are especially common for growth stocks that have tremendous long-term potential. Ignore the price swings and consider where the company will be in the next decade. Another Redditor mentioned that they owned 1,000 shares ofNetflix(NASDAQ:NFLX) about 18 years ago. Netflix doesn't receive as much attention since the FAANG acronym is out of style, but it's still a top-performing stock, especially for early investors. Trending: This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you tobecome a landlord in just 10 minutes, with minimum investments as low as $100. Netflix shares have gained anywhere from 30,000% to 50,000% since 2007, depending on when investors bought their shares. That's a massive gain to lose out on, but 2007 was right before the Great Recession, so it was common for people to exit the markets frantically. One commenter offered an interesting perspective on Netflix stock that highlights how some investors were thinking at the time. \"There were a lot of experts over the years, especially in the beginning, saying how other media companies were going to make [Netflix] irrelevant or basically put them out of business.\" Those concerns were unfounded, and it goes to show that some people forecast the absolute worst-case scenario. These overblown narratives may have caused some investors to abandon ship, especially during the Great Recession. Some people posted impressive gains in the comments section that don't feel so good knowing how the assets performed in the long run. One investor bought a bunch of Bitcoin at $0.50 apiece and sold them for $250 to buy a house. It's the type of gain you rarely get, but it still feels like the Redditor missed out on a great opportunity with Bitcoin now above $100,000 a coin. Another Redditor thought they did well when they boughtAdvanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ:AMD) shares for $2-$3 dollars and sold at $9.50. It's a 3x profit, but AMD stock now goes for more than $100 per share. It's easy to beat yourself up about missing out on 10x returns, but most investors should love a 3x return. While it makes for entertaining content, dwelling on missed opportunities isn't the right approach for building long-term wealth. You can learn from your mistakes and commit to long-term investments instead of selling amid volatility. See Next: $100k in assets?

        "content": "Nike (NKE) posted better-than-expected results for its fiscal fourth quarter as the company works on its turnaround plan, sending shares higher in extended trading Thursday. The sneaker and sportswear giant\u2019s revenue fell 12% year-over-year to $11.1 billion, though the figure topped the analyst consensus compiled by Visible Alpha. Net income of $211 million, or 14 cents per share, fell from $1.5 billion, or 99 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter, but also beat Street projections. The quarter represents Nike's third underCEO Elliott Hill, who took the helm of the company last October, and comes after Nikewarned in Marchthat its turnaround plan could hurt sales in the short term, but that its efforts to shift its portfolio would likely start to ease after the fourth quarter. \"Moving forward, we expect our business to improve as a result of the progress we're making,\" Hill said Thursday. CFO Matt Friend, who said the fourth quarter \u201creflected the largest financial impact\u201d from the company\u2019s turnaround efforts, forecast current-quarter revenue falling by a mid-single-digit percentage from a year earlier, in what would represent a marked improvement from recent double-digit declines. Friend also said the companyexpects to take a $1 billion hitfrom the Trump administration's tariffs, if left at current levels. However, he told investors during Nike's earnings conference call that the company intends to \"fully mitigate the impact of these headwinds over time.\" Nike shares jumped over 10% in extended trading following the company's earnings call.
