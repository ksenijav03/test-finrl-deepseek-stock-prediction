        "content": "Nations are rushing to embrace artificial intelligence (AI), and for good reason. AsNvidiaCEO Jensen Huang explained, \"Countries around the world are recognizing AI as essential infrastructure -- just like electricity and the internet.\" The Trump administration has signaled that the U.S. intends to lead the world in AI. Two businesses helping the government achieve this goal areBigBear.ai(BBAI4.50%)andC3.ai(AI-0.83%). Both companies have delivered AI solutions to the likes of the U.S. Army and Department of Defense. But if you had to choose between the two, which stock is the better AI investment for the long haul? Here's a look at each business to answer that question. Image source: Getty Images. BigBear.ai delivers various AI solutions that focus on national security and infrastructure. For example, it provides facial recognition software to many airports to screen passengers for security risks, and it's helping the U.S. Navy construct submarines with its AI-enhanced shipbuilding software. BigBear.ai's business delivered $34.8 million in the first quarter, a 5% year-over-year increase. It also benefited from the exercise of 2024warrantsto the tune of $64.7 million in gross proceeds. The company experienced leadership changes this year. Its CFO departed in June, and it gained a new CEO, Kevin McAleenan, in January. McAleenan served as Acting Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security during the first Trump administration, so his experience could prove beneficial to BigBear.ai's government business. That said, the company faces some challenges. BigBear.ai is not profitable. Its Q1 net loss totaled $62 million, as some of itsoperating expensesincreased year over year. BigBear.ai also possesses substantial debt. Its Q1 total liabilities of $198.5 million includedlong-term debtof $100.6 million, and that was after the amount was reduced by $58 million through voluntary conversions of its 2029 convertible notes. Q1 assets totaled $396.3 million. C3.ai offers ready-made and custom AI solutions. Government customers include the U.S. Air Force, the Marine Corps, and the National Science Foundation. It also boasts a sizable non-government business with clients such asExxonMobilandDow. The company leverages partnerships to expand its sales reach. Partners closed 193 agreements in C3.ai's 2025 fiscal year, ended April 30. This represented 68% year-over-year growth and 73% of total agreements. As a result, C3.ai sales rose 25% year over year to $389.1 million in fiscal 2025. The company anticipates that its 2026 fiscal year will kick off with at least $100 million in Q1 sales, which would represent 15% year-over-year growth compared to the prior year's $87.2 million. Like BigBear.ai, C3.ai is not profitable. It ended the 2025 fiscal year with a net loss of $288.7 million. However, itsbalance sheetwas healthy. Fiscal Q4 assets totaled $1 billion, while total liabilities were $187.6 million. Although both companies saw sales growth to start the year, the rest of 2025 could be a different story. The U.S. government is cutting budgets. The budget cuts could be damaging to BigBear.ai's business. The company stated: \"The majority of our revenue is derived from federal government contracts.\" The picture is different with C3.ai. Its federal government bookings represented 26% of the total for its 2025 fiscal year. Consequently, while budget cuts could hurt C3.ai, their effect on its business would be less than their effects on BigBear.ai. C3.ai's diversified revenue is a plus over BigBear.ai, but in deciding which is the better investment, another factor to look at is share price valuation. This can be determined with a review of each company'sprice-to-sales(P/S) ratio, which measures how much investors are willing to pay for every dollar of revenue.  Data byYCharts. As the chart shows, both businesses possess P/S multiples that are far more reasonable now compared to their peaks over the past year. For comparison, AI leader Nvidia's P/S ratio is 24 as of June 18, which indicates that BigBear.ai and C3.ai shares are attractively priced. That said, BigBear.ai's P/S ratio remains higher than it was a year ago, while C3.ai is lower. This suggests that C3.ai stock is a good value, while its AI rival isn't the bargain it was in 2024. When stacked against BigBear.ai, C3.ai's compelling valuation, superior sales growth, and strong balance sheet make it the better artificial intelligence investment forthe long term.",

        "content": "You don't need a lot of money to invest, especially now that so many brokers offer commission-free stock trading and no account minimums. If you have $1,000 saved, you could start to build a portfolio with a few high-quality companies. Here are three strong businesses with plenty of growth potential you might want to add to your portfolio. Image source: Getty Images. Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the most important technological developments in decades. FewAI companieshave been as successful asNvidia(NVDA0.33%), which develops the graphics processing units (GPUs) that provide the specific type of processing power that advanced AI applications need most. Since the AI boom began, Nvidia has consistently delivered fantastic financial results. In its fiscal 2026 first quarter, which ended April 27, it reported $44.1 billion in revenue, up 12% from the previous quarter and 69% year over year. It was the company's ninth consecutive quarter of revenue growth. Most of that revenue came from its data center segment, astech companieshave continued to purchase large numbers of Nvidia's GPUs for their data centers. Nvidia also has awide competitive moat, as its GPUs are by far the most popular ones available. It has a 92% share of the GPU market, leaving rival chipmakers likeAMDandIntelfar behind. The main arguments against investing in Nvidia now are that it's overvalued after its explosive growth, and that demand for its GPUs could plateau. As far as the valuation is concerned, Nvidia is trading at aforward P/E ratioof 33.6 at the time of this writing, a reasonable price for a leading tech stock. And while Nvidia won't maintain its 92% market share in data center GPUs, the quality of its hardware (and software) should help it maintain a strong customer base. SoFi(SOFI1.05%)is an online-only bank that aims to meet all the financial services needs of the average retail customer. It offers bank accounts, credit cards, loans, insurance, and an investing platform. If you want a one-stop shop to help you manage every aspect of your finances, SoFi fits the bill. There are a few reasons SoFi stands out in a crowded field ofbank stocks. All its financial products get high marks and seem to be well-liked by customers. Its banking, investment, and personal loan products all scored well with Motley Fool Money, The Motley Fool's personal finance brand. SoFi also has some unusual offerings, particularly among its investment products. For example, it enables customers to invest ininitial public offeringsbefore they begin to trade on public stock exchanges. It also has alternative investment funds for customers who want to invest in commodities, venture capital, real estate, and other alternative assets. SoFi's stock price has been up and down since it went public in 2021, but if its first-quarter results are any indication, 2025 could be a big year for the bank. The company set new records on net revenue ($772 million, up 20% year over year), new members (it added 800,000, bringing its total to 10.9 million), and product additions (1.2 million, bringing its total to 15.9 million). Even with that growth, SoFi is still a long way from competing on the same level as the major nationwide banks. It's currently the 60th largest bank in the U.S., according to the Federal Reserve. There's also the possibility that macroeconomic uncertainty could hurt SoFi's business. But if you're willing to hold on through potential volatility, SoFi stock could be a long-term winner. Mobile apps have become an everyday part of most people's lives, and mobile ad spending is projected to reach $228 billion this year.Adtech companyAppLovin(APP3.46%)helps developers connect to new audiences and monetize their apps through mobile ads. Unlike many marketing platforms, AppLovin has a performance-based business model. Its revenue is based on engagement as measured by third-party attribution, as opposed to fixed prices per click or per impression. AppLovin has also gone all-in on AI with the development of Axon, its AI-powered advertising engine that aims to help advertisers get the most engagement out of their marketing dollars. Performance analysis indicates that AppLovin delivers on that goal. Data from the marketing specialists at Northbeam found that AppLovin's average return on ad spend was 45% higher thanMeta Platforms'and 74% higher than secondary platforms, including TikTok, Snapchat, YouTube, and Pinterest. That data came specifically from October and November 2024, so it's hardly an exhaustive analysis, but it's still a promising result. AppLovin's financial growth is also promising. Revenue in the first quarter rose 40% year over year to $1.5 billion. Net income increased by 144% to $576 million. Both metrics have generally been on the rise over the last three years.  APP Revenue (Quarterly)data byYCharts. I'd consider AppLovin the riskiest of these three stocks, and it's the most expensive based on its price-to-earnings ratio. For those who don't mind a bit of risk in their portfolios, however, AppLovin's AI tools and effectiveness as an ad platform give it terrific upside potential.",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp. Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang has started selling the chipmaker\u2019s stock, his first transactions under a plan that allows him to offload up to $865 million worth by year\u2019s end. Most Read from Bloomberg Bezos Wedding Draws Protests, Soul-Searching Over Tourism in Venice US State Budget Wounds Intensify From Trump, DOGE Policy Shifts Taxi Wars Put Johannesburg Commuters in Peril as Rail Flounders Huang disposed of 100,000 shares over a two-day period of June 20 and June 23 for $14.4 million, according to a filing Monday with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Huang\u2019s sales are part of a new 10b5-1 plan adopted in March and disclosed last month in Nvidia\u2019s quarterly report. Huang is the world\u2019s 12th richest person with a $126 billion fortune, which is almost entirely made up of Nvidia shares, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The CEO has sold more than $1.9 billion in Nvidia stock, according to index calculations. Nvidia didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment outside of normal business hours on the sales. Huang\u2019s pre-arranged trading plan, common among billionaires and executives who want to cash in some stock without spooking investors, gives him the option to sell 6 million shares by the end of the year. That amount would be valued at $865 million at Monday\u2019s closing price of $144.17. Another filing on Monday shows Huang plans to sell another 50,000 shares imminently. Billionaire Nvidia board director Mark Stevens has also been selling stock. He disposed of more than 600,000 shares for about $88 million on June 18, according to a separate filing on Monday. Earlier in June, the investor filed a proposal to dispose of up to 4 million shares of the chipmaker\u2019s stock and has so far offloaded more than 2 million. Unlike Huang and other board directors, Stevens doesn\u2019t sell under a 10b5-1 plan. Stevens has a net worth of $9.8 billion, according to Bloomberg\u2019s wealth index.

        "content": "Tesla (TSLA) shares surged Monday after the EV maker launched its highly anticipatedautonomous robotaxi vehicle serviceon Sunday in Austin, Texas. While the rollout was limited,CEO Elon Musk has said in past interviewsthat the company plans to quickly expand to more cities and potentially hundreds of thousands of vehicles by the end of next year. Tesla bulls, such as Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, have pointed out that Tesla's robotaxis and self-driving software have the potential to double the automaker\u2019smarket capitalizationby the end of 2026. Tesla shares jumped more than 8% on Monday to around $349. The stock is still down about 14% since the start of the year, but it's risen more than 60% from its early-April low, boosted in part by Musk's decision to relinquish his role heading the Department of Government Efficiency andspend more time at his companies, including Tesla. Below, we take a closer look at Tesla\u2019s chart and usetechnical analysisto identify key price levels that investors will likely be watching. After apullbackto the 50- and 200-day moving averages, Tesla sharesconsolidatedwithin apennant patternjust above the closely watched indicators. More recently, the stock broke out from the pennant on above-averagevolumein Monday\u2019s trading session, setting the stage for a new leg higher. The move also coincided with a strong uptick in therelative strength index, indicating accelerating price momentum. Let\u2019s identify three key overhead areas on Tesla\u2019s chart to watch if the shares continue to rally and also locate an importantsupport levelworth monitoring. The first overhead area to watch sits around $365. This area, just 5% above Monday\u2019s closing price, could provide resistance near last month\u2019s prominentpeak, which also aligns with the Februarycountertrendhigh and twin peaks that formed on the chart last November. A convincing close above this area could trigger a rally toward $430. The shares may face selling pressure in this location near a series of trading activity situated just below the stock\u2019srecord highset in mid-December last year. Interestingly, this area also sits in the same neighborhood as a projectedupsidetarget that takes Tesla\u2019sprice actionfrom late April to late May and repositions it from this month\u2019s pullback low. Buying above this area could see the shares climb to around $489. This region on the chart would likely attract significant attention near the stock\u2019s record high, which may be seen as a suitable location tolock in profits. If Tesla\u2019s share price reverses course, it\u2019s worth closely monitoring the $285 level. Investors could seek buying opportunities in this area near ahorizontal linethat links this month\u2019s low with a range of corresponding trading activity on the chart stretching back to last November\u2019s election-drivenbreakaway gap.

        "content": "More than 30 years ago, the advent and proliferation of the internet represented a leap forward in growth potential for corporate America. Although it took years for businesses to turn this innovation into a powerful moneymaking tool, investors have been waiting a long time for the next game-changing trend to come along that can positively impact the corporate growth rate. The evolution ofartificial intelligence (AI)looks to be this next leap forward. Businesses are freely spending on the hardware and solutions necessary to gain a competitive edge within their respective industries. Based on estimates from PwC, global gross domestic product is expected to jump by 26% come 2030 solely because of AI. Image source: Getty Images. But what's even more interesting than speculating about where AI can take us is analyzing how Wall Street's smartest money managers have approached their trading activity in leading AI stocks. No later than 45 calendar days following the end to a quarter, institutional investors with at least $100 million in assets under management (AUM) are required to fileForm 13Fwith the Securities and Exchange Commission. A 13F offers a way for investors to track which stocks, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and select options Wall Street's most-successful asset managers bought and sold in the latest quarter. Thoughmost investors track Warren Buffett's trading activity like a hawk, he's not the only billionaire fund manager with an impressive track record. David Tepper of Appaloosa, who's currently overseeing north of $8 billion in AUM, is another billionaire investors wisely pay close attention to. Tepper is a big fan of the rise of AI, buthe's been quite picky about the artificial intelligence stocks he's buying and selling. Over the last two years, Tepper has shown two of the biggest players in the AI-graphics processing unit (GPU) space to the door, all while recently diving into one of the newest members of the trillion-dollar club on Wall Street. Despite abundant spending on data-center infrastructure and the AI-GPUs needed to facilitate split-second decisions and the training of large language models, Appaloosa's 13Fs have shown Tepper to be a persistent seller of shares ofNvidia(NVDA1.30%)andAdvanced Micro Devices(AMD3.67%), which is best known as \"AMD.\" Taking into accountNvidia's largest-ever forward split (10-for-1) in June 2024, Appaloosa's stake in Nvidia has shrunk from 10.2 million split-adjusted shares, as of June 30, 2023, to just 300,000 shares by March 31, 2025 --a decline of 97%! Meanwhile, Tepper's position in AMD was whittled down from a peak of 2.31 million shares in the June-ended quarter in 2023 to no shares remaining, as of March 31, 2025. While demand for AI-GPUs has been robust, there are a couple of reasons that may help explain why Appaloosa's billionaire investor headed for the exit. The most obvious of these reasons is that Tepper might have been locking in gains. Shares of Nvidia and AMD both soared amid the hype of the AI revolution, and the average holding in Tepper's fund has stuck around for less than 10 quarters (30 months). Cashing in his chips following a historic run-up for both companies would make sense. The concern is there may be more to this selling activity than Tepper's desire to lock in gains. For example, there areregulatory issues at play that make Nvidia and AMD somewhat risky investments. Both the Joe Biden and Donald Trump administrations restricted exports of advanced AI chips and related equipment to China, which is the world's No. 2 economy. These export restrictions, coupled with President Trump's global tariff policy, threaten to reduce sales and/or margins for AI hardware providers. Increasing competition is another potential worry for Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices. As long as AI-GPU scarcity persists, both companies can charge a premium for their hardware. But withexternal and internal competition picking up, this scarcity should wane over time and whittle away their pricing power. Lastly, there's thepotential for an AI bubble forming and bursting. There hasn't been a game-changing innovation in decades that's avoided a bubble early in its expansion phase. The fact that most businesses haven't yet optimized their Ai solutions and aren't generating a positive return on their AI investments suggests AI is a long way from being a mature technology. If history were to repeat and the AI bubble bursts, hardware providers like Nvidia and AMD would, presumably, be hit hard. Image source: Getty Images. Though billionaire David Tepper hasn't been shy about reducing his fund's exposure to key AI-GPU providers in recent quarters, there is one premier artificial intelligence stock he's buying. Specifically,Appaloosa's head investor opened a 130,000-share positionin AI-networking specialistBroadcom(AVGO4.07%)during the first quarter. Only11 publicly traded companies worldwide have ever achieved a $1 trillion valuation, 10 of which trade on U.S. exchanges. Broadcom is one of the more recent of these elite businesses to hit this psychologically important threshold. Broadcom stock really began to pick up steam two years ago, following its introduction of the Jericho3-AI fabric. Broadcom's integral role in the AI arena is to connect large numbers of GPUs to maximize their compute capabilities and minimize tail latency. In other words, Broadcom's solutions are designed toexpedite the split-second decision-making required of AI-driven software and systems. The bulk of Broadcom's growth and net sales are currently derived from the rise of AI and its advanced chips. In fiscal 2024, which ended on Nov. 3, 2024, it delivered $51.6 billion in sales, with approximately $12.2 billion coming from AI-related revenue. By fiscal 2027, CEO Hock Tan sees AI-related sales jumping to between $60 billion and $90 billion due to spending growth from a small number of hyperscale customers. Butwhat might make Broadcom so attractive to Tepper is its diversified operations. Make no mistake about it, AI is the fuel that's accelerated Broadcom's sales and profit growth. However, it's also one of the leading providers of wireless chips and accessories used in next-generation smartphones. Wireless providers expanding the reach of their 5G networks has led to a consistent smartphone replacement cycle and healthy demand for Broadcom's solutions. In addition to being a key player in wireless chips for smartphones, it also provides an assortment of solutions to the industrial sector and is theparent of cybersecurity solutions provider Symantec. Furthermore, Broadcom has leaned on acquisitions as a means to expand its product and service ecosystem. For instance, its mammoth $69 billion buyout of cloud and virtualization software company VMware in November 2023 better positioned it to become a major infrastructure technology player for businesses managing applications across private and hybrid clouds. If the AI bubble were to burst, Broadcom would be expected to navigate a challenging environment for tech stocks far better than Nvidia or AMD.",

        "header": "Prediction: Palantir Stock Will Plunge to $55 by 2027",
        "content": "For more than two years, no trend has captivated the attention and pocketbooks of investors quite like the rise ofartificial intelligence (AI). The ability for AI-empowered software and systems to make split-second decisions without the oversight of humans is a technology with broad-reaching potential in most industries around the globe. InSizing the Prize, the analysts at PwC estimate a combination of productivity improvements and consumption-side effects from AI will boost worldwide gross domestic product by 26%, or $15.7 trillion, come 2030. If this figure is even remotely accurate, it means a long list of companies will benefit from this game-changing technology. Image source: Getty Images. Although graphics processing unit (GPU) kingpinNvidiais often viewed as the face of the AI revolution, a strong argument can be made that it's been surpassed by AI- and machine learning-driven data-mining specialistPalantir Technologies(PLTR-0.67%). When 2023 began, Palantir was a company of fringe importance in the tech sector. But following a greater than 2,000% gain in two and a half years, it's become the eighth-largest publicly traded U.S. tech stock. But in spite of everything seemingly going its way,it's my expectation that Palantir stock will plungeto $55 (representing a decline of 60%), at minimum, by 2027. However, before making predictions about the future, it's imperative to understand how Palantir's $330 billion market cap foundation was built. The primary reason Wall Street and investors love Palantir so much is simple:it offers a sustainable moat. The company's two core operating segments -- Gotham and Foundry -- lack large-scale competition. When public companies have no clear one-for-one replacement and don't have to look over their proverbial shoulder, they tend to be rewarded with a hefty premium by the investing community. Something else Palantir brings to the table that investors seem to appreciate is its operatingcash flowpredictability. Gotham, which services federal governments by aiding with mission planning and execution, as well as data collection/analysis, typically lands multiyear contracts. Meanwhile, the enterprise-focused Foundry platform, which helps businesses better understand their data, is a subscription-based model. Wall Street loves predictability, and a lot of Palantir's sales can be forecast multiple years in advance. Speaking of forecasting, Palantir shifted to recurring profits well ahead of the consensus from Wall Street analysts. The company has demonstrated that its operating model is viable and time-tested. Another reason investors have piled in is the company's pristine balance sheet. Palantir Technologies closed out the March-ended quarter with $5.43 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, with no debt. This mammoth cash pile allows CEO Alex Karp to aggressively invest in platform innovation(s), as well as reward shareholders with occasional stock buybacks. The icing on the cake for Wall Street and investors -- aside from Palantir's sustained annual sales growth of between 25% and 35% -- isDonald Trump's November victory. Historically, Republican-led governments have favored strong defense spending. Further, Trump is a big proponent of national security and making America an AI leader. It's the ideal situation for Gotham (Palantir's leading platform) to thrive. Image source: Getty Images. When viewed with a wide lens, Palantir is a fantastic business with a sustainable moat that's utilizing AI and machine learning to sustain a double-digit sales growth rate. Buteven fantastic businesses can run into historical headwinds. While I don't deny that Palantir is cash-rich, profitable, and capable of sustaining its competitive moat, its premium valuation will almost certainly come under pressure over the next two years due to two factors. To begin with, there hasn't been a game-changing technological innovation or hyped trend for more than three decades that'smanaged to avoid an early stage bubble-bursting event. In other words, every major technological advancement since (and including) the advent of the internet in the mid-1990s has seen investors overestimate early innings adoption and/or utility. There's no question America's most-influential businesses have an appetite for AI hardware and applications at the moment. Nvidia's skyrocketing sales are evidence of businesses wanting to be on the leading edge of the AI revolution within their respective industries. But what we're not seeing is evidence of businesses optimizing their AI solutions or consistently generating a positive return on their AI investments. Without exception, every next-big-thing technology has needed time to mature, and AI simply isn't there yet. Thegood news for Palantiris its multiyear contracts via Gotham and subscriptions from Foundry would help insulate its top-line results from an immediate drop-off if the AI bubble bursts. Unfortunately, investor sentiment would still be expected to weigh heavily on Palantir stock, if history were to repeat. The second significant downside catalyst for Palantir stock, based on what history has to say, is its valuation. Although a premium valuation multipleiswarranted for companies that boast a sustainable moat,Palantir stock has pushed this premium into the stratosphere.  PLTR PS Ratiodata byYCharts. PS Ratio = price-to-sales ratio. Prior to the bursting of the dot-com bubble a quarter of a century ago, prominent internet-driven businesses likeMicrosoft,Cisco Systems, andAmazonsaw their respectiveprice-to-sales (P/S) ratioscatapult higher. Something similar occurred with AI-GPU giant Nvidia last summer. Though their trailing-12-month (TTM) P/S ratio peaks all occurred at different times, these four companies topped out at TTM P/S ratios ranging from about 30 to 43. As of the closing bell on June 20,Palantir's TTM P/S ratio was tipping the scales at (drum roll) 110! No megacap company on the leading edge of a next-big-thing trend has been able to maintain a TTM P/S ratio of 30 to 40 for a considerable length of time, let alone a triple-digit figure. Even if Palantir were to meet Wall Street's consensus forecast, which calls for cumulative sales growth of 132% from 2024 ($2.87 billion, actual) to 2027 ($6.65 billion, estimated), it would still be valued at awell-above-averagemultiple of 20 times sales in 2027 at $55 per share. Though it's impossible to pinpoint when the music will slow or stop for Palantir, history couldn't be clearer that abig-timedecline is in order.",

        "content": "Stock splits have fascinated investors over the past few years, with even the biggest artificial intelligence (AI) names -- such asNvidiaandAmazon-- completing such operations after their stock prices skyrocketed. But one AI stock, in particular, hasn'teverlaunched a split, and that'sMeta Platforms(META1.78%). Here's why this company, which has soared more than 300% over the past three years, could be next on the list. Image source: Getty Images. Before diving in, though, let's take a closer look at how and why companiessplit their stocks. These operations are used to lower the price of each individual share -- so companies generally do this after their stock prices have made significant gains and have arrived at a price that may discourage some investors from buying. For example, as stocks approach the $1,000 mark, even if valuation looks fine, they still may be viewed as expensive by certain investors. And investors who don't have access tofractional sharesmight find it difficult to buy a stock at these levels. These two elements could weigh on demand for the company's stock, limiting its potential for further gains. Companies split their stock by simply offering more shares to current holders -- the number of shares depends on the ratio of the split. So, for example, in a 10-for-1 split, if you originally held one share, you would hold 10 post-split. The value of each share would be worth less than it was prior to the operation, but the total value of your holding would remain the same. All of this means a stock split doesn't change anything fundamental about the company or the stock, but it does make it easier for a broader range of investors to buy. As mentioned, Nvidia and Amazon completed splits, along with other technology giants such asBroadcomandAlphabet. And, over time, almost every member of the \"Magnificent Seven\" -- a group of tech stocks that led the stock market higher last year -- has completed a stock split. The exception is social media and AI powerhouse Meta. Like its fellow Magnificent Seven players, Meta has delivered impressive stock performance -- and actually is the second-best performer over the past three years, after AI chip giant Nvidia.  METAdata byYCharts Today, Meta shares trade for more than $600, outpacing the rest of these star tech stocks -- Microsoft is the closest, with shares trading for about $470. Though Meta actually is the second-cheapest of the bunch -- trading for only 26xforward earnings estimates-- the stock's price tag still could dissuade investors or make it difficult for some investors to access it.  META PE Ratio (Forward)data byYCharts When Nvidia launched its split a year ago, the company said it was doing so to make it easier for employees and other investors to invest -- so companies do recognize this as an issue and use stock splits to address it. If Meta, like Nvidia, takes this view, the tech giant could decide to launch a split in the months to come. A split also is a great idea at this point in Meta's story because it offers investors a positive message after a difficult first half for the tech industry. When a company splits the stock, bringing it down to a lower level, the move implies the company is confident about its prospects -- and believes the stock could soar once again. Finally, now is a good time to announce this sort of operation, because Meta could benefit from amore positive environmentfor AI stocks ahead. Earlier this year, investors worried about a slowdown in AI investment, but this didn't happen, and interest in AI remains high. The soaring demand seen by AI chip providers such as Nvidia andAdvanced Micro Devicesillustrates this. Against this backdrop, investors may flock to companies heavily involved in AI, and this movement may lead Nvidia higher. Meta is known for its social media apps, led by the flagship Facebook, but the company also has developed its own large language model, Llama, and is using it to power features across its apps. This is key because the more time we spend on these apps, the more advertisers will see this as the ideal spot to reach us -- and advertising brings in most of Meta's revenue. All this means that a stock split could be very beneficial for both investors and for Meta -- and that's why this company may be next on the list to carry out such an operation.",

        "header": "This Is Nvidia's Next Trillion-Dollar Opportunity, According to Jensen Huang -- and It's Something You Might be Overlooking",
        "content": "Nvidia(NVDA0.33%)generated more than $44 billion in revenue during its fiscal 2026 first quarter (which ended April 27), with $39.1 billion of that total coming from its data center business alone. The company sells the most powerful graphics processing units (GPUs) in the world for data centers, and they are the chips every artificial intelligence (AI) developer wants to use. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang thinks AI data center spending will top $1 trillion per year by 2028, but he's eyeing another trillion-dollar opportunity: autonomous vehicles. The company's automotive segment is often overlooked by investors because it contributes a minuscule amount of revenue compared to the data center segment, but that could soon change if Huang's recent forecasts come to fruition. Image source: Nvidia. Besides sensors and other advanced hardware components, a self-driving car requires AI software which is trained on millions of hours of real-world data to ensure it's equipped to safely deal with every possible scenario when sharing the road with other vehicles and pedestrians. Building a roadworthy autonomous vehicle isn't easy, and only a small handful of companies are having success. Alphabet'sWaymo is completing more than 250,000 paid autonomous ride-hailing trips every week in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Phoenix, and Austin, andTeslahopes to have its autonomous robotaxi on the road in California and Texas this year. Both of these companies have invested billions of dollars in developing proprietary autonomous hardware and software, but many car manufacturers don't have the expertise or the financial resources to compete. That's where Nvidia's Drive platform comes in. It's a complete hardware and software solution that includes the powerful Thor chip, which processes data from the car's sensors to make lightning quick decisions on the road. It's gaining serious traction, with top brands likeMercedes-Benz,Toyota,General Motors,Rivian, and Volvo choosing to adopt it. Back in January, Jensen Huang said self-driving cars could be the first multitrillion-dollar segment of theAI poweredrobotics industry. Then, in a more recent interview with CNBC in June, he said this could be the decade of autonomous vehicles (and autonomous machines in general), which suggests these technologies might be on the cusp of going mainstream. As I mentioned at the top, the data center business is the dominant contributor to Nvidia's revenue. During the first quarter of 2026, the automotive segment generated $567 million in revenue, accounting for just 1.3% of the company's total. However, earlier this year Jensen Huang said Nvidia's automotive revenue could come in at $5 billion for the whole of fiscal 2026, which would be a whopping 194% increase from its fiscal 2025 result of $1.7 billion. But that's not all, because car manufacturers are starting to invest heavily in Nvidia's other products to customize and refine their self-driving offering in order to stand out from the competition. Huang says many car makers are buying Nvidia's DGX data center systems fitted with the latest BlackwellGPUs, so they have enough computing power to continue improving their self-driving AI models. Plus, they are using Nvidia's multimodal foundation model called Cosmos, which is pre-trained on more than 20 million hours of video, so it already has a comprehensive understanding of the physical world. Cosmos can be used to run millions of simulations using synthetic data, which can be used to further train self-driving models. In other words, it reduces the need to collect data from real-world driving, which can be a cumbersome and time consuming process. The new Cosmos Predict-2 models offer deeper functionality and faster throughput to deliver even better results. According to Wall Street's consensus estimate (provided by Yahoo! Finance), Nvidia could deliver $199 billion in totalrevenueduring fiscal 2026. Therefore, even if its automotive revenue triples to $5 billion, it would still be a very small part of the overall business. Investors who buy Nvidia stock today are still doing so for the strength of its data center segment. Nevertheless, this could be a great entry point for investors who believe autonomous driving will eventually be a multitrillion-dollar opportunity over the long term as Huang expects, because Nvidia stock is quite attractive at the current level. It's trading at aprice-to-earnings (P/E) ratioof 46.4, which is a 23% discount to its 10-year average of 60. Plus, Wall Street thinks Nvidia'searnings per sharecould grow to $4.29 during fiscal 2026, placing its stock at aforward P/E ratioof 33.5:  NVDA PE Ratiodata byYCharts That means if Wall Street's forecast proves to be accurate, Nvidia stock will have to climb 38% over the next 12 months or so just to maintain its current P/E ratio, and it would have to soar by 79% to trade in line with its 10-year average P/E ratio of 60. But investors might want to focus on the longer term considering autonomous driving has the potential to become yet another trillion-dollar opportunity for the company.",

        "header": "3 Phenomenal AI Stocks That Investors Should Load Up On",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) investing doesn't have to be hard. Plenty of stocks look like attractive investments, and they're often right in front of investors. Successful AI investing doesn't mean finding the nextPalantir(NASDAQ: PLTR)orNvidia(NVDA1.30%); sometimes, it's just picking the proven winners and letting them deliver. That's why I think this trio is an excellent investment, as all three have a proven track record of delivering excellent results for investors. Three stocks that I think investors should load up on are Nvidia,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(TSM2.12%), andBroadcom(AVGO4.07%). There's a common theme that unites these three stocks and makes them excellent buys right now. Image source: Getty Images. Nvidia'sgraphics processing units (GPUs)have built the AI products that we know and interact with today, and with its leadership position, that won't change anytime soon. Nvidia is continually innovating and developing the best GPUs possible, which has kept it at the top of the AI arms race over the past few years. However, Nvidia wouldn't be able to keep innovating without Taiwan Semiconductor's production capabilities. Nvidia can't make chips, so it farms that work out to Taiwan Semiconductor, the world's leading contract chip manufacturer. Taiwan Semiconductor's facilities allow it to produce the most advanced chips in the world at an impressive yield, which is why nearly every competitor in the AI arms race uses its chips. Another company that uses chips from TSMC is Broadcom, which is involved in the AI arms race in two ways. The first way is its connectivity switches. These devices allow GPUs to operate independently from each other, and the information from each device is stitched together to form an answer to a workload that was split across multiple GPUs. Additionally, Broadcom partners with AI hyperscalers to develop their own custom AI accelerators, which it calls XPUs. XPUs can outperform GPUs in specific scenarios Broadcom and the end user have designed them for. While this technology isn't going to replace GPUs, it complements them in a well-rounded AI infrastructure buildout. While this trio has experienced impressive growth over the past few years, they still have a lot ahead of them, making them excellent investment options right now. Nvidia's growth has stayed rapid over a time frame most investors would have never thought possible two years ago. If third-party projections come true, it could extend even further. During its 2025 GTC event, Nvidia cited a third-party research company's projection that data center capital expenditures will rise from $400 billion in 2024 to $1 trillion by 2028. That's huge growth, and considering that Nvidia gets a nice chunk of that pie if the buildouts expand to $1 trillion by 2028, Nvidia would be an excellent stock to buy now. Taiwan Semiconductor's management is very bullish on its growth prospects, thanks to AI. Over the next two years, it sees a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 45% for AI-related revenue. This will help push its overall growth rate to nearly a 20% CAGR, which is incredible growth considering TSMC's size and dominance already. Broadcom may have the most bullish outlook, as it's slated to see huge growth as AI inference begins to take over. Inference occurs when an AI model is pinged for an answer, and Broadcom's connectivity switches and XPU are perfectly suited for these tasks. As a result, it expects to see massive growth over the next few years. In fiscal year 2024, which ended Nov. 3, 2024, Broadcom's AI-related revenue from semiconductors (including switches and XPUs) was $12.2 billion. However, that could reach anywhere from $60 billion to $90 billion by fiscal year 2027, resulting in massive growth for Broadcom's stock.  AVGO Revenue (TTM)data byYCharts Although all three stocks have been successful investments over the past few years, they are also excellent stock picks for the future. As a result, I think investors should take the opportunity to increase their position size or add these stocks to their portfolio. If AI-related spending continues to grow, these three will be its primary beneficiaries. There are clear signs of increasing AI spending,making this group a no-brainer buy.",

        "content": "WithNvidia(NVDA1.30%)up by more than 40% from the 52-week low it touched in early April, the stock is now back near its record high. Concerns that a slowdown in spending on artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure might have been coming now look to have been overblown. At the same time, Nvidia is adding platforms and products that customers can integrate into the growing AI ecosystem. Given the company's solid growth prospects and its near-record-high market cap, it might be time for Nvidia to split its stock again. If that happens, it would be Nvidia's seventhstock splitsince the chipmaker began trading publicly in 1999. Its last was a 10-for-1 split implemented a little more than a year ago on June 7, 2024. Image source: Nvidia. Nvidia's leading graphics processing units (GPUs) have driven a remarkable jump in revenue for the company. Data center sales exceeded $39 billion in its recently reportedfiscal first quarter. That was up from just $4.3 billion only two years ago. The company has a clear plan about how to keep that growth going, too. Nvidia is now looking beyond its large tech customers to maintain, or even accelerate, growth. It was already a key technology partner to the U.S.-basedStargate projectannounced in January by OpenAI, SoftBank, andOracle. More recently, it joined those tech companies and others to develop a massive Stargate AI campus in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). That Middle Eastern country's AI campus will eventually have a footprint of 10 square miles with 5 gigawatts of electricity dedicated to powering its data centers. That isn't the only project where Nvidia is working to expand nations' sovereign AI ambitions. CEO Jensen Huang recently traveled to Germany and announced a new AI factory to be operated byDeutsche Telekom. Huang stated: In the era of AI, every manufacturer needs two factories: one for making things, and one for creating the intelligence that powers them. By building Europe's first industrial AI infrastructure, we're enabling the region's leading industrial companies to advance simulation-first, AI-driven manufacturing. At a Paris tech summit just last week, Nvidia revealed that several hyperscalers are also working with France, Italy, and the United Kingdom to build sovereign AI computing infrastructure that relies on Nvidia's cutting-edge GPUs. News of all of those partnerships has helped propel Nvidia's stock upward. All that business and stock momentum makes it reasonable to wonder if Nvidia could be looking at another stock split. At least in the short term, that could well result in Nvidia stock providing investors with market-beating returns. Historical data shows that over the 12 months following the announcement of a stock split, the shares of the company in question typically outperform the market. Image source: Statista. That makes sense when one thinks about why companies generally decide to split their stocks. The financial maneuver itself doesn't change anything about the inherent value of the business, nor of any shareholder's piece of it. But splits are typically conducted from a position of strength. Company management wouldn't want to shine a spotlight on their stock at a time when the underlying business is suffering, after all. There are several practical reasons for a stock split. A lower share price gives retail investors a feeling of affordability. With the growing ability totrade fractional shares, share price really shouldn't matter, but it still seems to for manyretail investors. Splitting a stock can also benefit company employees by making the shares more accessible should the company offer an employee stock investment plan. Nvidia hasn't given any indication that it plans another stock split. Yet there could be one on the horizon as its business continues to thrive and demand for AI infrastructure expands. With or without a stock split, however, investors should consider buying and holding Nvidia stock for the long term.",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- China\u2019s advantages in developing artificial intelligence are about to unleash a wave of innovation that will generate more than 100 DeepSeek-like breakthroughs in the coming 18 months, according to a former top official. Most Read from Bloomberg Bezos Wedding Draws Protests, Soul-Searching Over Tourism in Venice US State Budget Wounds Intensify From Trump, DOGE Policy Shifts Commuters Risk Lives in Johannesburg With Taxi Groups at War The new software products \u201cwill fundamentally change the nature and the tech nature of the whole Chinese economy,\u201d Zhu Min, who was previously a deputy governor of the People\u2019s Bank of China, said during the World Economic Forum in Tianjin on Tuesday. Zhu, who also served as the deputy managing director at the International Monetary Fund, sees a transformation made possible by harnessing China\u2019s pool of engineers, massive consumer base and supportive government policies. The bullish take on China\u2019s AI future promises no letup in the competition for dominance in cutting-edge technologies with the US, just as the world\u2019s two biggest economies are also locked in a trade war. The US sees China as a key rival in the field of AI, especially after DeepSeek shocked the global tech industry in January with its low-cost but powerful model. In addition to efforts to prevent China from securing advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment, Washington is blocking Chinese companies from acquiring Nvidia Corp.\u2019s high-end AI chips for training, citing national security concerns. Beijing is now pinning its hopes on domestic tech giants like Huawei Technologies Co. when it comes to advanced chipmaking. The emergence of DeepSeek triggered a rally in China\u2019s tech stocks, fueling optimism over Chinese competitiveness despite tensions over trade with the Trump administration and economic challenges at home. Bloomberg Economics estimates the contribution of high-tech to China\u2019s gross domestic product climbed to about 15% in 2024 \u2014 from near 14% a year earlier \u2014 and could exceed 18% in 2026. The World Economic Forum\u2019s annual meeting in Tianjin, also known as \u201cSummer Davos,\u201d has attracted global business executives and world leaders. Singaporean Prime Minister Lawrence Wong and Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh are scheduled to speak at the three-day event. Chinese Premier Li Qiang is expected to address the conference during the opening plenary on Wednesday and meet with participants. Despite a tariff truce negotiated a month ago with the US, American levies are still at high levels, with a more lasting deal still in question. Analysts polled by Bloomberg forecast GDP growth will slip to 4.5% this year, significantly below the official target of around 5%. It expanded 5.4% in the first quarter. \u201cThe uncertainty brought by US tariff policy is an important factor that may lead to negative growth in global trade this year,\u201d Zhu told reporters on the sidelines of the forum. \u201cThe entire trade industrial chain has begun to slow, investments has begun to stop, so the impact is greater than the actual tariff rate.\u201d Zhu said the US will likely see inflation pick up starting in August, as it takes some time for tariffs to feed through to the economy and for companies to use up stockpiles they accumulated before Trump hiked duties. Despite shocks from abroad, China\u2019s GDP likely grew faster than 5% in the second quarter, according to Huang Yiping, a member of the Chinese central bank\u2019s monetary policy committee. Speaking at the Tianjin forum, he pointed to the economy\u2019s solid performance in April and May and early positive signs from high-frequency indicators in June. But despite unexpectedly strong retail sales in May, when they grew at the fastest pace since December 2023, Huang said China still needs to address the issue of insufficient consumption. \u201cBoosting consumption is still a big challenge, partly because the global external market is less open as before,\u201d said Huang, who\u2019s also dean of the National School of Development at Peking University. \u201cFor a large country, you can\u2019t continuously export your excess capacity,\u201d Huang said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I think the policy priority now is to first focus on domestic circulation.\u201d Huang said there\u2019s a perception that China\u2019s stimulus policy during the global financial crisis was too aggressive given some of the subsequent problems such as asset bubbles and local government debt. But the lesson isn\u2019t necessarily that China should hold back this time around. \u201cI personally would still support decisive policy action today, and then quickly turn around to deal with the problems later,\u201d he said.

        "content": "Nvidia(NVDA1.30%)stock seems to have shrugged off its doubters. After struggling earlier this year amid a generalized sell-off and fears of lower-cost competition, the stock is on the verge of returning to its all-time high. That may have new investors wondering whether they should buy thesemiconductor stock. Is there still an opportunity to earn market-beating returns from Nvidia, or have investors who didn't get in earlier missed the boat? Image source: Nvidia. Nvidia undoubtedly benefits from its lead in the AI accelerator market. Once known primarily as a maker of graphics processing units (GPUs) for gaming, it leveraged its cutting-edge parallel processor technology to springboard into the data center and AI markets. That led to the development of the accelerators that allowed developers to bringgenerative AIto fruition. Consequently, 89% of its revenue in its fiscal 2026 first quarter (which ended April 27) came from its data center segment, which designs and sells its market-leading AI accelerators. That was a remarkable shift, considering that the data center segment barely exceeded the revenue levels of the gaming segment three years ago. Its success also set off alarm bells across the semiconductor industry, and competitors such asAdvanced Micro Devicesscrambled to catch up ever since. Even as peers work to close the gap, Nvidia continues to advance its chips. Its current top-of-the-line accelerators, such as the GPUs based on its Blackwell architecture, have enabled it to maintain its market dominance. Moreover, only Nvidia's chips can be programmed using its popular CUDA software ecosystem. That makes it more difficult for Nvidia's established customers to switch to competitors' hardware. Additionally, even though it appears that developers are finding ways to train generative AI models using lower-cost chips, demand for Nvidia's most advanced accelerators remains strong. Grand View Research forecasts a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for the AI accelerator market of 29% through 2033. When it comes to the AI inference market, that CAGR rises above 80%, according to AMD. Thus, even if competitors can establish footholds in certain niches of this market, industry growth makes it unlikely Nvidia's peers will challenge its dominance. Nvidia's financials reflect the industry's rapid expansion. In the first quarter of its fiscal 2026, revenue grew 69% year over year to $44 billion. While that was slower than its triple-digit percentage revenue growth in the previous fiscal year, the increase was unprecedented considering its $3.5 trillionmarket cap. Still, a 211% increase in the cost of revenue slowed earnings growth. Though it still earned nearly $19 billion in net income, the rising cost of revenue took yearly profit growth to 26%. For fiscal Q2, Nvidia expects revenue of approximately $45 billion, which would amount to a yearly increase of 50%. That estimate also accounts for an $8 billion revenue loss caused by export control limitations. Investors should also remember that the stock price has risen by an astounding 1,450% over the last five years. Yet in the past 12 months, Nvidia stock is up by only 7%. Worries about low-cost competition and tariffs weighed on the company in the first half of the year, though the stock is approaching the record high it set in January. Confusion about how to value Nvidia may also be a factor in its stock price behavior. ItsP/E ratioof 47 may appear inexpensive considering the company's still-massive revenue growth and its dominance in the AI accelerator niche. Still, itsprice-to-sales (P/S) ratioof 24 is high enough to lead to some concerns about whether its valuation truly is compelling. Despite those questions about the stock's valuation, Nvidia is likely to beat the market over the long term. Admittedly, competition in the AI accelerator market will probably continue to intensify. Nonetheless, the high anticipated compound annual growth rate for AI accelerators is a bullish indicator for Nvidia, and it remains the most essential company in that space by just about any standard. Thus, even if growth rates slow, they are likely to remain high enough that Nvidia's stock price growth will outpace theS&P 500for some time to come.",

        "content": "Artificial intelligence(AI) isn't a bubble. It's the technological innovation of our age -- one that will alter the course of humanity for the foreseeable future. Want definitive proof?Meta Platforms(META2.36%)CEO Mark Zuckerberg is reportedly willing to pay $100 million in bonus packages to poach top AI talent from rivals, personally sending WhatsApp messages to hundreds of researchers and hosting them at his homes to close deals. When one of the world's richest CEOs abandons his executive suite to become his company's chief recruiter, you know you're witnessing something far more substantial than dot-com era vaporware. While everyone obsesses over which company will build the first superintelligence, the smartest money is quietly accumulating positions in the companies that will profit regardless of which company wins. Think of it this way: During the California Gold Rush, the prospectors went bust -- but the folks selling picks and shovels got rich. Today's AI revolution follows the same playbook. The following five stocks are perfectly positioned to profit from every dollar spent in this technological arms race. Image source: Getty Images. Nvidia(NVDA0.33%)gets all the AI chip headlines, but the real story is its transformation into a full-stack AI computing company. While investors fixate on quarterly graphics processing unit (GPU) sales, Nvidia is quietly building the computing platform for the next generation of humanoid robots, agentic AI systems, andautonomous vehicles. The company's chips and software are becoming the preferred choice for developers building everything from factory robots to self-driving cars. The robotics market alone could reach $375 billion by 2035, yet Wall Street still values Nvidia like a semiconductor company selling commodity chips. Amazon(AMZN-0.57%)is deploying 750,000 robots across its fulfillment centers, but that's just the beginning of its automation journey. Its next-generation AI-powered robots are designed to work alongside human employees, handling the most physically demanding tasks while freeing workers to focus on higher-value activities. This human-robot collaboration could drive fulfillment costs down by 50% within five years through increased efficiency and reduced workplace injuries. If Amazon's automation investments pay off as expected, its operating margins could expand from today's 11.8% towardApple-like levels above 31% -- a margin-expansion story the market hasn't begun to price in. Meta Platforms might be spending billions on AI talent, but the real payoff comes when it merges artificial intelligence with its metaverse ambitions. Imagine AI agents that can build entire virtual worlds on command, create photorealistic avatars indistinguishable from humans, and enable real-time translation across 100 languages in virtual meetings. While predicting exact market sizes is challenging, some analysts believe the AI-powered metaverse could become a multitrillion-dollar opportunity by 2035 -- a massive market hiding in plain sight. ASML(ASML1.62%)owns the most important monopoly nobody talks about. This Dutch company manufactures the only extreme ultraviolet lithography machines capable of etching the nanoscale transistors required for next-generation AI chips. Every single advanced AI chip -- whether made by Nvidia,AMD, orIntel-- depends on ASML's machines. With a 10-year technological lead and a multibillion euro backlog, ASML essentially holds the keys to the entire AI hardware kingdom. S&P Global(SPGI0.70%)isn't building AI -- it's feeding the beast. The company's vast troves of financial data are becoming the training ground for Wall Street's AI revolution, with its newMicrosoftCopilot integration putting 160 years of market intelligence at traders' fingertips. As every hedge fund and investment bank races to build AI-powered trading systems, S&P Global gets paid regardless of who wins, collecting tolls on the data superhighway that makes it all possible. The AI gold rush is real, but the smartest investors know that owning the infrastructure beats betting on individual prospectors every time. These five stocks offer diversified exposure to every corner of the AI revolution -- from the chips that power it to the data that fuels it to the platforms that will commercialize it. While some chase the latest AI start-up unicorn, investors who own these infrastructure plays -- either directly or through technology-focusedexchange-traded funds (ETFs)like theVanguard Information Technology ETF(VGT) -- are positioned to profit from the companies that make the entire ecosystem possible. The beauty of this approach? You don't need to pick which AI model wins or which start-up gets acquired. You just need exposure to the companies selling the picks and shovels to everyone digging for gold.",

Here's what investors need to know today. U.S. stock futures are pointing higher on PresidentDonald Trump's ceasefire announcement, which came hours afterindexes closed higheryesterday on optimism that the Iran-Israel conflict could subside. Investors are watching today fortestimony from Fed Chair Jerome Powelland\u00a0consumer confidence data. Futures associated with theNasdaq,S&P 500, andDow Jones Industrial Averageare up by about 1%, 0.8%, and 0.6%, respectively. Bitcoin(BTCUSD) is rising to trade at over $105,000. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note and gold futures are lower. Oil futures are down sharply after Trump\u2019s ceasefire announcement, sending oil-producer stocks lower in premarket trading. BothBrentandWest Texas Intermediatecrude futures aredown roughly 3%. Chevron (CVX), ExxonMobil (XOM), and Occidental (OXY) shares are moving roughly 1%-2% lower in early trading after posting declines yesterday as theoil rally fadedamid coolingtensions in the Middle East. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell isscheduled to testifybefore the House Financial Services Committee at 10 a.m. ET today, with the embattled central banker likely to face tough questions from Trump's allies in Congress. The president has repeatedly criticized Powell on social media over the Fed's decisions tokeep interest rates unchangedat their current rate of 4.25% to 4.5%. In a post on his Truth Social network early Tuesday, Trump wrote that interest rates should be \u201cat least two to three points lower.\" FedEx (FDX) is set to report fiscal fourth-quarter results after the bell today, with analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha expectingadjusted earnings per share to riseto $5.88 from $5.42 a year ago as the shipping giant continues its cost-cutting efforts. Revenue is projected to decline about 1% year-over-year to $21.82 billion amidtariffs pressure. The report comes days after the company'sfounder Fred Smith died.

        "header": "Is MercadoLibre Stock Your Ticket to Becoming a Millionaire?",
        "content": "Investors are celebrating theS&P 500being back in the positive in 2025, but it's up only 2% as there's plenty of uncertainty remaining in the economy. The S&P 500 is only an average, but it reflects trends in the broader market, and it tends to be quite accurate. Many of today's hottest stocks are similarly up or down a bit this year, likeNvidiastock going up 7% after gaining 171% last year andAmazonstock going down 2% after climbing 44% last year. But not all stocks are in that boat. E-commerce powerhouseMercadoLibre(MELI2.06%)continues to thrive as a business, and its stock is trouncing the market, up 41% this year. Let's see whether this top stock can make you a millionaire. Investors may be focusing on non-U.S. stocks right now, but MercadoLibre has been a market-beating stock for a long time. It consistently reports outstanding performance in nearly all areas. Its main business is e-commerce, and it operates an online marketplace similar to Amazon in 18 Latin American countries. Despite being around for quite a while, this business continues to grow rapidly. In the 2025 first quarter, gross merchandise volume increased 40% year over year (currency neutral). Items sold increased 28%, and unique active buyers were up 25%. That's its fastest growth since the pandemic started, when it accelerated. The company credits its investments for enhancing its value proposition with driving growth in unique buyers. Image source: Getty Images. It has one of the fastest delivery rates on the planet, with 74% of orders reaching their destinations within 48 hours in Q1. That's a slowdown from a high of 80% in 2021, and for good reason. The company offers a membership program called Meli+ with the option for a weekly delivery day, and while it brings down its two-day delivery rate, it cuts down on costs. The company has developed a robust fintech platform to service its underbanked customers, and this business is also flourishing. Total payment volume increased 72% year over year in Q1, and monthly active users were up 31% to more than 64 million. The fintech platform includes a large credit business, with different kinds of accounts, loans, and credit cards. Assets under management more than doubled from last year in the first quarter, and the credit portfolio increased 75%. MercadoLibre is demonstrating fantastic performance right now, but there are also many reasons to be confident about the future. E-commerce in Latin America is still way behind other parts of the world. Penetration is in the mid-teens, which lags behind the U.S. by about a decade. The marketplace has a self-reinforcing network effect where as there are more buyers, more sellers get on the platform. This leads to more choices and more competitive pricing, a higher value proposition, and more buyers. As buyers become more comfortable with the platform, engagement increases, and more buyers purchase across more categories. There's a similarly huge opportunity in fintech, where the banking industry is being disrupted. MercadoLibre has an edge because of its ecosystem, and platform users are already in the system. In Brazil, one of its biggest markets, legacy banks still have about 59% of the market, but that's changing. In Argentina, another of its large markets, the loan-to-gross domestic productratio is less than 10%, while it's above 50% in Brazil. It's also growing its advertising business and sees opportunities to further expand into new areas, giving it a long growth runway in many directions. Like any stock, how much you put in will somewhat determine how much you can make. Do I see MercadoLibre becoming a multibagger for new investors? I do. As an example, let's say it can grow at acompound annual growth rate(CAGR) of 30% over the next five years. With a 64% increase (currency neutral) in Q1, and similar performance in general, that seems credible. That would lead to revenue of $78 billion in five years. Keeping itsprice-to-sales ratioconstant, the stock would nearly quadruple. There's no guarantee that this will happen, but it's a possible scenario. If you put in enough money and have a long time horizon, it could turn into $1 million. However, that will only work for investors who have that much to invest in one stock while remaining well diversified. If you don't have that much to invest, buying MercadoLibre stock today can still be a valuable addition to a portfolio that could lead to millionaire status.",

Revenue fell more than 10% year-over-year to $1.53 billion but came in narrowly above Visible Alpha consensus. Earnings per share of $1.50 dropped from $2.15 a year ago but also topped analysts' projections. Still, KB Home lowered its housing revenue forecast for the second straight quarter to $6.30 billion to $6.50 billion, down from the $6.60 billion to $7.00 billion range the companylaid out in Marchand below analysts' expectations of $6.57 billion. \"While longer term the outlook for the housing market remains favorable driven by demographics and an undersupply of homes, consumers are continuing to demonstrate a lack of confidence about the short term, which has impacted their home purchase decisions,\" CEO Jeffrey Mezger said in Monday's earnings call, according to a transcript from AlphaSense. Mezger said the company saw \"more subdued demand\" in the spring selling season asAmericans faced affordabilitychallenges,persistently high mortgage rates, and other macro and geopolitical uncertainty.

Also like the Austin partnership that launched in March, Uber users can choose in their settings whether they want to take autonomous rides, and will be given the choice to accept or decline and switch to a person-driven ride when they book a trip. In Austin, where more than 100 Waymo vehicles are on the Uber platform, the robotaxi space has started to get more crowded with Tesla (TSLA)launching its ownsmall-scale program over the weekend. The companies announced Austin and Atlanta as their first targets for the program last September, more than a year after revealing an agreement that they would eventually bring Waymo vehicles to Uber's platform.

Based on currentoptionsprices for FedEx's stock, investors are anticipating a move of close to 7%, or just over $15, in either direction over the rest of the week of trading after the Tuesday afternoon report. At the high end, that would put FedEx stock at just over $247, with the low end just over $216. The stock has had some volatile sessions after its recent earnings reports.Shares sank 6%the day afterlast quarter's report, and rose 1% following December's results whenFedEx announced plansto spin off its Freight business. FedEx shares are down by nearly a fifth since the start of the year, with their largest drop following the \"Liberation Day\" tariff announcement, amid concerns that shipping demand could take a hit if tariffs raise prices and lead to a decrease in discretionary spending. In its fiscal fourth quarter, FedEx isprojected to reporta small decline in revenue from the same time a year ago to $21.81 billion, while adjusted earnings per share are expected to rise to $5.86 from $5.42 as FedEx continues to work through its cost-cutting efforts. Analysts are still mostly bullish on FedEx's stock, with 12 \"buy\" ratings among the 14 analysts tracked by Visible Alpha and just two \"hold\" ratings.

        "content": "U.S. power grids face their first major test of the summer this week as a heat wave brought extreme temperatures and humidity to much of the country. The U.S. is expected to demand 10 gigawatts (GW) more electricity this summer compared with last year, more than double the increase between 2023 and 2024, according to the North American Electric Reliability Corporation's (NERC) 2025 Summer Reliability Assessment. For the most part, grids are expected to meet demand under normal conditions, but NERC warns some regions could struggle to handle extreme heat. The Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO), which supplies power to about 42 million customers across the Midwest, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi, \"is at elevated risk of operating reserve shortfalls during periods of high demand or low resource output,\" according to NERC. Since last summer, the system has retired nearly 1.6 GW of capacity, which has mostly been replaced with more variable solar power. Other areas at risk of shortfalls include New England, Texas, and much of the Great Plains. For investors, a strained grid can be a mixed bag, according to Jefferies analysts. \"In the long term, a tightening supply/demand picture is positive for utilities and merchants via higher investment needs and margins, respectively,\" the analysts wrote in a note on Monday.NextEra Energy (NEE) and Duke Energy (DUK) are two utilities they said could benefit from a tighter grid in Florida, which \"had the largest contraction in overall/normal reserve margins\" of any region in the last year. Texas Independent Power Producers\u2014companies like NRG Energy (NRG) and Vistra (VST), which generate electricity but are not public utilities, and thus sell their power directly to clients at market rates\u2014\"had a Goldilocks update\" this year, said Jefferies. The state's ability to meet demand under normal conditions has improved while its extreme demand readiness deteriorated, \"primarily due to higher reliance on renewables.\"Electricity demand is expected to grow at a brisk pace as the state courts energy-intensive industries like data centers and semiconductor fabrication. But in the near term, a strained grid increases headline risk. \"Utilities always take the political blame for outages and reliability events,\" the analysts noted. For that reason, utilities operating in high-risk regions could also be at risk of a high-profile outage dinging investor sentiment.",

The issuance likely put downward pressure on the stock price as it signals a potentialdilutionof Supermicro shares and an increase in debt levels, both of which can diminishshareholder value.

The stock was up nearly 5% at around $43 in mid-afternoon trading Tuesday, after dropping 10% yesterday. Below, we break down thetechnicalson Supermicro\u2019s chart and point out crucial price levels worth watching out for. After reclaiming the200-day moving average (MA)last month, Supermicro shares consolidated within asymmetrical trianglebefore breaking down from the pattern in Monday\u2019s trading session on the highestvolumesince mid-May Meanwhile, the move lower coincided with therelative strength indexfalling to its lowest reading in over a month to signal weakening price momentum.

Let\u2019s identifysupport and resistancelevels on Supermicro\u2019s chart that investors will likely be watching. The first support level to watch sits around $38. This area would likely provide support near the two key moving averages and a range ofpeaks and troughson the chart extending back to last September. The bulls\u2019 inability to defend this crucial level could see the shares revisit lower support at $30. Investors may look toaccumulate sharesin this location near a series of troughs that formed on the chart between December and April. This level also roughly matches adownsidetarget when taking the price bars that followed an earlier breakdown from a symmetrical triangle and repositions them from the currentbreakdown.

        "content": "Micron Technology, Inc.MU will report fiscal third-quarter earnings after the closing bell on Wednesday. With its strong performance in the S&P 500 this month, a notable increase in both revenues and profits in the upcoming report could boost its stock price. So, should investors buy Micron stock pre-earnings or await clarity on margins? Let\u2019s explore \u2013 Micron is expected to report earnings per share (EPS) of $1.59 in the fiscal third quarter, a substantial increase from $0.62 in the same quarter last year, representing a year-over-year jump of 156.5%. Strong demand for Micron\u2019s products in high-value segments, coupled with improved pricing conditions, is expected to drive the company\u2019s earnings. Revenues are estimated to reach $8.84 billion in the fiscal third quarter, up 29.7% from last year\u2019s sales of $6.81 billion. It\u2019s also more than the fiscal second quarter\u2019s sales of $8.05 billion. Sequentially rising sales indicate increased demand in memory markets, especially those driven by artificial intelligence (AI). Additionally, Micron\u2019s 10.7% average positive earnings surprise over the past four quarters indicates a strong likelihood of meeting its fiscal third-quarter results and boosting its stock price. (Find the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.) Image Source: Zacks Investment Research With the rise of AI, the demand for graphics processing units (GPUs) has grown because they can handle multiple tasks more efficiently. Now, GPUs require data storage memory, with Micron\u2019s HBM3E leading the industry. NVIDIA CorporationNVDA, therefore, has selected Micron\u2019s HBM for its upcoming GB200 and GB300 Blackwell systems. Additionally, other chipmakers likeBroadcom Inc. AVGO andMarvell Technology, Inc.MRVL are working on integrating HBM into their platforms, suggesting potential growth for Micron. Micron expects the data center HBM market to grow to $35 billion this year, reaching $100 billion by 2030. The company confirmed that it has sold out its entire HBM capacity for this year and is negotiating new contracts for next year. The high demand for HBM has allowed Micron to increase its pricing by 11% in 2025. The rise in HBM demand and prices positions Micron for strong earnings both in the upcoming report and in the future. Micron also stands to benefit from the growing demand for DRAM in AI smartphones and PCs. Strong earnings expectations from high demand for HBM products will boost Micron\u2019s stock price. The projected rise in NVIDIA\u2019s AI chip sales due to Micron\u2019s HBM3E in their GPUs will further benefit its business and stock value. Micron also plans to increase market share against Samsung, as the latter faces challenges passing NVIDIA\u2019s qualification test with HBM3E memory chips, compared to Micron\u2019s improving HBM-chip yields. Stakeholders should, thus, hold Micron stock for long-term positive returns. Brokers, too, are somewhat positive about Micron\u2019s prospects, increasing the average short-term price target for MU to $127.07 (up 2.8%) from $123.60. The highest target is $172, indicating a potential 39.2% upside. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research However, investors should be cautious about Micron\u2019s declining gross margin; it fell from 39.5% in the first quarter to 37.9% in the second, with a forecast of 36.5% for the third quarter. Despite revenue growth, margin compression occurs due to intense price competition counteracting the benefits from increased volumes and better market scenarios. Hence, new entrants should delay betting on Micron stock until after the fiscal third-quarter results for clarity on revenue growth and margin pressures. For now, Micron has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Sandisk Corporation (SNDK)'s share was trading at $42.5 as of 13thJune. A data centre room with cloud technology, illustrating the enterprise application software services. Sandisk, now operating independently following its separation from Western Digital, is quietly carving out a powerful niche in the AI infrastructure arms race. Its Gen5 enterprise SSDs were recently certified by NVIDIA for datacenter use, officially embedding the company into the AI server vendor chain. The standout innovation is Sandisk\u2019s proprietary High Bandwidth Flash (HBF) architecture\u2014developed fully in-house\u2014designed for massive capacity and throughput, tailored specifically for AI workloads. This positions Sandisk as a one-of-a-kind supplier with differentiated technology. Complementing this, the company is shipping BiCS8, one of the most power-efficient flash technologies currently available. Cloud hyperscaler traction is rising rapidly: 12% of total output went to AWS, GCP, and Azure this quarter, up from 8% a year ago, reflecting intensifying AI-related spend. This growth appears sustainable, as internal reports from major tech companies show transformative AI deployment efforts already yielding dramatic productivity gains. While the company still has a consumer-facing segment, its real upside lies in enterprise AI, where it's now gaining relevance in billion-dollar deal cycles. Financially, Sandisk posted $1.7B in revenue and $220M in adjusted free cash flow this quarter, with $1.5B in cash on hand. Despite soft gross margins (22.7%) due to pricing and NAND volatility, management is focused on restoring profitability. The company is also making moves in gaming, EVs, and content creation, expanding its flash technology footprint. Risks remain, including thin options liquidity and lingering consumer weakness, but with unique AI-aligned assets and accelerating cloud demand, Sandisk offers asymmetric upside. For now, it's a high-risk bet with potentially transformative payoff. Previously, we covered abullish thesison Intel (INTC) by Jellym9s on wallstreetbets in December 2024, framing it as a turnaround bet anchored by its Foundry Services and geopolitical tailwinds favoring domestic chip production. The thesis outlined a potential strategic pivot away from lagging product segments toward becoming the U.S. equivalent of TSMC. The thesis on Sandisk (SNDK) by b0men extends this theme of U.S.-based semiconductor resurgence, but through the lens of AI infrastructure. Sandisk\u2019s proprietary enterprise SSD technology and early traction with hyperscalers signal a niche, high-performance role in AI datacenters, offering complementary upside to Intel\u2019s foundry ambitions. Sandisk Corporation (SNDK) is not on our list of the30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 44 hedge fund portfolios held Sandisk Corporation (SNDK) at the end of the first quarter which was 0 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of SNDK as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

        "header": "Why Is AMD (AMD) Stock Soaring Today",
        "content": "Shares of computer processor maker AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) jumped 6.5% in the afternoon session after Melius Research analysts upgraded the stock, citing improving prospects for the company's artificial intelligence chips. Melius upgraded the stock from \"hold\" to \"buy\" and significantly raised its price target from $110 to $175 per share. The analyst noted that \"many things have changed for the better since the beginning of the year,\" highlighting AMD's potential to gain ground on rival Nvidia, particularly in the AI inference market. The firm believes investors will become more excited about AMD's GPU sales outlook from 2026 to 2028 and sees its upcoming MI400 processor, set to launch next year, as a potential big winner. The upgrade added to positive momentum for semiconductor stocks, boosting the overall sector. The shares closed the day at $138.48, up 6.9% from previous close. Is now the time to buy AMD?Access our full analysis report here, it\u2019s free. AMD\u2019s shares are very volatile and have had 21 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today\u2019s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business. The previous big move we wrote about was 8 days ago when the stock gained 9.4% on the news that Piper Sandler analysts maintained a Buy rating and raised the price target from $125 to $140. Following talks with management, the analysts became more bullish on AMD's AI business and expect the segment to grow even faster when the tariff headwinds in China have passed. They also highlighted the growing conviction on Wall Street regarding one of AMD's hyperscaler clients. Separately, stocks rebounded as reports pointed to easing tensions between Israel and Iran. The Wall Street Journal said senior Iranian officials had signaled a willingness to restart stalled nuclear talks, on the condition that Washington refrain from joining Israel's ongoing strikes. This development triggered a significant decline in oil prices, easing inflation concerns. Also, it is possible some investors were buying the dip following the sell-off at the end of the previous week. AMD is up 14.7% since the beginning of the year, but at $138.33 per share, it is still trading 24.8% below its 52-week high of $183.96 from July 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of AMD\u2019s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $2,640. Unless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefiting from the rise of AI.Click here to access our free report on our favorite semiconductor growth story.",

        "content": "US stocks jumped Tuesday, with the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) and S&P 500 (^GSPC) closing at their highest levels since February, putting both indexes within range of new record highs. The Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F), which tracks many of the market\u2019s most influential tech names like Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), and Apple (AAPL), notched a fresh closing high, underscoring renewed momentum in megacap tech. The rally came as optimism grew around a fragile US-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Iran, raising hopes for a more lasting end to regional hostilities. Markets were also focused onFed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s testimony to Congress, where he signaled the central bank could cut interest rates \"sooner rather than later\" while maintaining flexibility to wait and assess the inflationary impact of new tariffs. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the gains, rising about 1.4%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) added 1.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) also rallied, jumping over 500 points, or roughly 1.2%. A relief rally has been building amid hopes for a lasting end to the 12-day-old Middle East conflict, which has spooked markets with its risks of squeezed oil supply and escalation into full-blown war. On Monday, US stocks rose as Iran's response to US attacks signaled adesire to deescalatetensions. On Tuesday, President Trump said that thepause in hostilities had begun. Meanwhile, Israel confirmed it had agreed to a trucebrokered by the USandannouncedby Trump late on Monday. But just hours later, Israel accused Iran of breaching the ceasefire. Trump lashed out at both sides, though the fragile truce ultimately appeared to hold up for now. Oil prices continued a descentas the prospect of a lasting truce eased worries about disruption to the supply of crude, centered on the risk that Iran would block the key Strait of Hormuz conduit for tankers. Brent (BZ=F) and West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) futures both moved toward levels seen before the outbreak of the conflict. Meanwhile,Powell's testimony beforethe House Financial Services Committee came asTrump turns up the pressureon the Federal Reserve chair to cut interest rates. In prepared remarks, Powell reiterated his stance that the central bank can afford to hold interest rates steady for now, saying, \"For the time being, we are well-positioned to wait to learn more about the likely course of the economy before considering any adjustments to our policy stance.\" FedEx (FDX) shares fell roughly 5% in after-hours trading Monday after the company issued a weaker-than-expected earnings forecast for the current quarter as investors continue to weigh soft demand and tariff-related concerns. For its fiscal first quarter, FedEx expects adjusted earnings between $3.40 and $4.00 per share, falling short of the $4.03 analysts had anticipated, according to Bloomberg estimates. The company said the guidance reflects its current economic outlook and assumes no further deterioration in global trade or geopolitical conditions. Citing an \"uncertain global demand environment,\" FedEx also said it will not provide full-year guidance. Despite the cautious outlook, FedEx reported stronger-than-expected results for its fiscal fourth quarter, with adjusted earnings of $6.07 per share, above the $5.81 average analyst estimate. US stocks surged Tuesday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) and benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) closing at their highest levels since February, nearing record highs. The Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) hit a new all-time close, driven by strength in megacap tech like Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), and Apple (AAPL). The Nasdaq rose 1.4% while the S&P gained 1.1% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) jumped over 500 points. Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul reports: Read more here.

Bitcoin miners also jumped, with Riot Platforms (RIOT) gaining 6.7% and MARA Holdings (MARA) adding 4.6%. Cryptocurrencies themselves also surged. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) jumped nearly 3% to trade around $105,900. Ethereum (ETH-USD) rose 6.6%, XRP (XRP-USD) gained 7.4%, and Solana (SOL-USD) was up 4.1%. Oil futures extended declines to drop 6% on Tuesday after President Trump furiously sought to maintain an increasingly fragile ceasefire between Israel and Iran. West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) fell as much 6% to trade near $65 per barrel, while Brent crude (BZ=F), the international benchmark, also tumbled to hover above $67 per barrel. Crude prices are now near levels back before the Israel-Iran conflict started more than a week ago. On Tuesday morning Trump wrote on social media, \"ISRAEL is not going to attack Iran. All planes will turn around and head home, while doing a friendly \u201cPlane Wave\u201d to Iran. Nobody will be hurt, the Ceasefire is in effect!\" Earlier on Tuesday morning, Trump urged Israel to stop its strikes on Iran after Tel Aviv accused Tehran of breaching the truce that had gone into effect just hours earlier. Nvidia (NVDA) shares jumped over 2% Tuesday to $147.40, putting the stock on track to end the trading session at its highest level since its record close in January. Nvidia notched a record closing price of $149.41 on Jan. 6, but the AI chipmaker\u2019s shares have struggled in the months following that high as Trump\u2019s trade war and AI competition in China rattled the markets. Nvidia has risen more than 12% in the past month alone, roughly double the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite\u2019s (^IXIC) 6.3% gain. Chip stocks rallied across the board Tuesday. Intel (INTC) climbed 6.5%, AMD (AMD) climbed 6.2%, and Broadcom (AVGO) rose 3.2%. US-listed shares of Nvidia\u2019s Taiwan-based contract manufacturer TSMC (TSM) soared 4.3%. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) was set to hit a fresh record close Tuesday, trading above 22,400. The index hit its last record close of 22,175.60 on Feb. 19. Uber (UBER) stock jumped 8% midday Tuesday as the ride-hail platformlaunched robotaxi ridesin partnership with Alphabet's (GOOGL,GOOG) Waymo in Atlanta. Alphabet stock was up nearly 2%. Uber and Waymo have partnered to offer robotaxi rides in Phoenix and Austin, as well. Waymo last week applied for a permit to test its self-driving cabs in New York City. \"UBER would be a natural strategic partner for Waymo in NYC,\" Jefferies analyst John Colantuoni wrote in a note to clients on June 20. Uber and Alphabet's gains come as Tesla (TSLA) stock fell after incidents involving its own robotaxis caught the attention of regulators. Also last week, Uberunveiled a new AI platform, which offers its data to help train AI models for other companies. RBC Capital Markets analyst Brad Erickson said the move was\"somewhat eyebrow raising for how outside of the core business it might seem but there's certainly good logic for UBER leveraging the combo of highly unique datasets for model training.\" Uber shares are up 52% in 2025. Nvidia (NVDA) and Amazon (AMZN) led the \"Magnificent Seven\" Big Tech stocks higher midday Tuesday. Nvidia shares jumped 1.8%, while Amazon rose 2.3% Meta (META) and Google (GOOG) climbed 1.3% and 1.8%, respectively. Microsoft (MSFT) rose about 1%, and Apple (AAPL) traded roughly flat. The gains came as tech stocks outperformed the broader market on Tuesday. The Technology Sector (XLK) rose 1.6%, ahead of the S&P 500's (^GSPC) roughly 1% climb. The sector climbed 3% over the past 10 trading sessions, while the broader index is up 1.3%. Bank of America (BAC) analysts wrote in a note to clients Tuesday morning that tech inflows last week reached their highest level since June 2024. Meanwhile, Tesla (TSLA)fell 1.6%after incidents involving its robotaxis caught the attention of regulators. In remarks made on Capitol Hill early Tuesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell brushed aside political criticism and reaffirmed the Fed\u2019s commitment to its mission: delivering a strong and stable economy for the American people. When asked about recent name-calling and public pressure from political leaders, including accusations from President Trump of being\"too late\" on rate cuts, Powell made it clear that such distractions don\u2019t influence the Fed\u2019s work. \"We\u2019re focused on one thing,\" Powell said at the start of his two-day testimony. \"And that is we want to deliver a good economy for the benefit of the American people. That\u2019s it. Anything else is kind of a distraction.\" Powell didn\u2019t reference any specific criticism or comments but underscored his approach to the job, saying, \"We always do what we think is the right thing to do. And, you know, we live with the consequences. I don\u2019t know how else to do the job.\" Pressed again on whether the American people should be concerned about political attacks swaying the Fed\u2019s independence, Powell added, \"I care about doing the job for the American people. The things we do matter a lot for people\u2019s lives, and that really concentrates the mind.\" \"You want to just stay focused on that task as long as you\u2019re sitting in these chairs that we occupy. Focus on that task. Do what you think is the right thing and take the consequences.\" 'Well-positioned to wait' Earlier in his testimony, Fed Chair Jerome Powell reiterated that the central bank can afford to hold interest rates steady for now. In prepared remarks to the House Financial Services Committee, he said, \"For the time being, we are well-positioned to wait to learn more about the likely course of the economy before considering any adjustments to our policy stance.\" Beyond addressing political pressure, Powell also spoke to broader economic challenges facing the Fed, including the impact of tariffs and rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. On inflation, he acknowledged the potential effects of trade: \"At this time all forecasters are expecting pretty soon that that some significant inflation will show up from tariffs\" Powell said, referencing the Fed\u2019s latest projections of higher inflation and slower economic growthcompared to March's forecast. As for the conflict between Israel and Iran, Powell urged caution: \"It's too early to know what any economic implications might be. I would not want to speculate. Like everyone else, we are, of course, watching the situation.\" Yahoo Finance's Ines Ferr\u00e9 reports: Read more here. Consumer confidence retreated in June after a large increase seen the month prior amid President Trump's various tariff delays. Thelatest index readingfrom the Conference Board was 93 in June,below the 98.4 seen in Mayand the 99.8 economists had expected. After seeing its largest one-month increase since May 2009 in the month prior, the expectations index decreased to 69 in June, down from 73.6 in May. \"Tariffs remained on top of consumers\u2019 minds and were frequently associated with concerns about their negative impacts on the economy and prices,\" Stephanie Guichard, senior economist of global indicators at The Conference Board, said in the release. \"Inflation and high prices were another important concern cited by consumers in June.\" US stocks jumped on Tuesday after President Trump told Israel to halt its strikes on Iran, amid hopes that a fragile US-brokered ceasefire between the two will hold and lay the groundwork for a more permanent end to hostilities. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) popped about 0.6%, or roughly 275 points, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) added 0.7%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the advance, gaining about 1%. Hims & Hers Health (HIMS) stock rose modestly in premarket trading Tuesday after plummeting nearly 35% on Monday. The stock gained 0.4% just ahead of the opening bell. Shares sold off Monday after Novo Nordisk (NVO) announced it would no longer make its blockbuster weight-loss drug, Wegovy, available on the Hims & Hers telehealth platform. Novo Nordisk accused Hims of breaking the law by continuing to sell copycat versions of its drug alongside Wegovy. Read more here. Robotaxi competition is heating up, as two Big Tech firms vying for autonomous driving dominance announced competing rollouts this week. Following fast on Tesla's (TSLA) heels, Waymo announced on Tuesday it is rolling out itsrobotaxi service in Atlantaas part of its partnership with Uber (UBER). In addition to the Atlanta geography, the more established Alphabet-backed (GOOG,GOOGL) autonomous driving startup now offers self-driving rides in Los Angeles, Austin, Phoenix, and San Francisco and is expected to begin operating in Miami and Washington, D.C., next year. But Alphabet shares, which rose a little over 1% on Tuesday morning, haven't receivedthe same investor excitementas Tesla shares.

        "content": "You probably know you should be investing, but you might not know where to start. Fortunately, the process is easy. After all, you're setting up an automatic process, and you don't need a large amount of money to begin. In fact, establishing a systematic investment is almost as easy as opening ahigh-yield savings account(HYSA),Roth IRA, or anonline broker account. Asystematic investment plan (SIP)involves making regular contributions to some type of financial account, like a401(k), mutual fund, orbrokerage account. When you set up a systematic investment plan, you select your risk tolerance by choosing whole or fractional shares of the investments you think best align with your goals. Before you open an account or establish a contribution schedule, take a minute to define your goals for the account. For example, you might be saving for a short-term goal like purchasing a vehicle, paying for a vacation, or saving for a long-term goal like retirement. Knowing your financial goals will allow you to determine the account and investment you need for your portfolio. If you are more conservative, a HYSA may suffice, but a brokerage invested with stocks, ETFs, or mutual funds may be more beneficial for more aggressive investors. When researching an investment account, read up on a platform's customer service reviews and find out if there are minimum deposit requirements. Now's also a good time to learn about commissions and other fees. A systematic investment plan should make it easy to save for your financial goals. While there are a few things you need to figure out to set up a plan, once you do, funding your account is really straightforward. The best thing you can do is to get started today.",

The decision to omit a full-year sales or profit estimate for fiscal 2026 comes after FedExslashedits fiscal 2025 outlook three quarters in a row. For the first quarter of fiscal 2026, FedEx said it expects adjusted earnings of $3.40 to $4, below the analyst consensus compiled by Visible Alpha. The company called for revenue to come in flat to up 2% year-over-year, better than the Street expected. In its fourth quarter, FedEx reported revenue of $22.2 billion, up less than 1% year-over-year and above of the analyst consensus.

In the video above, Tematica Research chief investment officer Chris Versace shares what he will be watching for from the event. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Asking for a Trendhere. I usually usually shareholder meeting, kind of humdrum, right? Doesn't have a lot of fireworks. You got executive comp that gets rubber stamped. We elect the board. Maybe a shareholder proposes something the board hates and it goes down in flames. But tomorrow, you say actually What we can I think we could see something, right? Because typically, companies tend to give an overview of how business is going, right? They might comment on some recent developments. And this is Jensen Wang after all. And he does spin a pretty good yarn. Josh, to the extent that he says anything incrementally positive, whether it's reaffirming expectations that Wall Street has, talks about inference, which was a comment we talked about earlier about AMD and the huge push that that's going to have, maybe he says something about how Blackwell is doing, or what I'd like to hear is, hey, margins in the back half of the year, they are going to ramp as we mature in our Blackwell production. It could be anything. Could be nothing. But we have to pay attention. You own Nvidia in this portfolio. The Street Pro portfolio? Absolutely. After the run it's enjoyed, Chris, are you just kind of sitting tight here? Are you adding? You booking a little profit? Well, so typically, we have a very hard rule with the Pro portfolio. If a position eclipses four and a half percent, we will start to trim it back. Now, the Nvidia position, even though it's been very strong, and we own a decent size in the portfolio, it hasn't hit that point yet. So we are watching it. So some of the data points that I'm watching that could potentially tip us into that area. Well, as we move into from June to July, we could get some Taiwan Semiconductor monthly revenue numbers, their quarterly results, same for Foxconn, those are nice leading indicators. We'll also going to be watching big tech and what they have to say about capital spending levels for the second half of the year. Do they say anything early? Maybe not formal numbers, but tip their hand a little bit for what capital spending could be in 2026. If we see that happening and it's positive, that really could lift Nvidia further. What about the yellow flag I will hear some folks throw, which is what if Nvidia can't sell? What if Jensen can't sell his latest and greatest AI chips to Beijing? Then what? I think a lot of that's been kind of baked in. That's not a new conversation. I would actually flip it around and say what about what we're seeing for AI and data center growth outside the US? You know, and I joked earlier, we were off camera, you know, they're building data centers in Armenia. You know, you can see whether it's, you know, the European version of Stargate, or other countries, there is ramping data center demand. And I think that with Blackwell being sold out, you know, there is room for some upside as these other projects are announced.",

Amazon (AMZN) aims to expand its same-day and next-day delivery to 4,000 \u201csmaller cities, towns and rural communities\u201d by the end of 2025, the company said in a press release Tuesday.The e-commerce giant is investing $4 billion in tripling the size of its delivery network, yet has a ways to go to match Walmart's (WMT) reach in smaller communities, Morgan Stanley said. \u201cThe battle for the rural last mile in America is intensifying,\u201d Morgan Stanley told clients in a research note Monday. \"As Kong (WMT) fights Godzilla (AMZN) in the battle for retail and eCommerce supremacy, the favored weapon of choice has often been delivery/logistics,\" the analysts said. Winning over rural communities is a \u201c$1 trillion opportunity,\" according to Morgan Stanley. One-fifth of nationwide spending on goods, excluding cars and gas, occurs in non-metropolitan counties, the analysts said. Rural residents\u2019 grocery spending is particularly sought-after as retailers see an opportunity to close the gap in online food shopping, Morgan Stanley said. About 72% of urban households bought groceries online in the past three months, compared to 41% of rural residents, according to surveys cited by Morgan Stanley. Walmart has about 25% of the domestic grocery market share and has ramped up its delivery service in recent years, the note said. The company intends to offer same-day delivery to 95% of the population by the end of the calendar year. Amazon is the fourth-largest player in the grocery industry, behind Walmart, Costco (COST) and Kroger (KR), Morgan Stanley said. It plans to stock commonly ordered items, such as coffee pods and diapers, at existing delivery stations, and use the facilities to cater to regional preferences like the popularity of wild bird food in Dubuque, Iowa. The two companies collectively account for about 20% of rural market share, Morgan Stanley estimates, with Walmart having a substantially bigger foothold. Their success in rural America may also come at the expense of other retailers that sell staples, including Dollar General (DG), Dollar Tree (DLTR), and Tractor Supply Co. (TSCO), as well as shipping giants like United Parcel Service (UPS) and FedEx (FDX), the analysts said.
