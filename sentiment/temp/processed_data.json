        "header": "Nvidia's Stock and Business: How Did I Do With My 5-Year Predictions Made in 2020?",
        "content": "In March 2020, I outlined where I thought tech giantNvidia's business and stock would be in five years, or in March 2025. It's now a little past the five-year mark, so how did I do? Overall, I'd give myself a B or a B+. I was mostly correct in my business predictions and accurate about what investors care about the most, the stock price: \"I feel very comfortable predicting that Nvidia stock will solidly outperform the market over the next half decade,\" I wrote. Indeed, from March 1, 2020 (when my five-year predictions article published) through March 1, 2025, Nvidia stock's total return was 1,760% -- nearly 15 times theS&P 500's return of 118%. In other words, Nvidia stock turned a $1,000 investment into a whopping $18,600 over this five-year period. (Nvidia stock's five-year return through the date of this writing, June 4, is a little lower, as the chart below shows. Shares are up since March 1; it's the change in the 2020 start date that slightly lowers their current five-year return.) Nvidia stock's fantastic performance has largely been driven by the incredible demand for the company's graphics processing units (GPUs) and related technology that enableartificial intelligence(AI) capabilities. Image source: Getty Images. Status: Correct. In March 2020, I wrote that \"as long as [Huang] stays healthy, the odds seem in favor of his still being at Nvidia's helm in five years.\" For context, Jensen Huang, who co-founded the company in 1993, turned 62 in February, according to public records. Nvidia investors should certainly hope that Huang remains the company's leader for some time. As Iwrotein June 2024: Nvidia is many years ahead of the competition in AI-enabling technology thanks to Huang's foresight. Starting more than a decade ago, he began to steadily use profits from Nvidia's once-core computer gaming business to position the company to be in the catbird seat when the \"AI Age\" truly arrived. Status: Correct. Here's part of what I wrote in the March 2020 article: Nvidia dominates the market for discrete graphics processing units (GPUs) -- the key component in graphics cards for desktop computer gaming. In the fourth quarter of 2019, the company controlled 68.9% of this market. Nvidia has increased its leadership position over the last five years. In the fourth quarter of 2024, it had an 82% share of the desktop discrete GPU market, compared with longtime rivalAdvanced Micro Devices' 17% share, according to Jon Peddie Research.Intel, which entered this market in 2022, had a 1% share. Growth in Nvidia's gaming market platform will be covered below. Status: Correct. In March 2020, I wrote: \"In 2025, the gaming market should be much bigger [relative to 2020].\" By all counts -- the number of global gamers, total computer gaming market revenue, and computer gaming PC revenue -- the computer gaming market has grown solidly over the last five years. And Nvidia has benefited nicely from this growth. In fiscal year 2020 (ended late January 2020), the company's gaming market platform generated revenue of $5.52 billion. In fiscal 2025 (ended in late January), this platform's revenue was $11.35 billion. This increase amounts to a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15.5%. This is strong growth for such a huge market. It might not seem so only because Nvidia's data center market platform's growth has been phenomenal over this same period. In fiscal 2020, gaming was Nvidia's largest platform, accounting for 51% of its total revenue. In fiscal 2025, gaming was its second-largest platform behind data center, contributing about 9% of its total revenue. Status: Correct. In March 2020, I wrote: The company's GPU-based approach to accelerating computing is considered the gold standard for DL [deep learning, the dominant type of AI] training, the first step in the two-step DL process. [The second step is inferencing.] This statement is extremely likely to hold true in 2025, in my opinion. Since 2020, both AMD and Intel have launched GPUs for AI-powered data centers, but Nvidia's grip on this market -- which is growing like wildfire -- remains tight. IoT Analytics, a technology market research firm, estimates Nvidia had a 92% share of the data center GPU market in 2024. As an added plus, since 2020, Nvidia's GPUs have gone from having very little share of the AI inferencing chip market to having the largest chunk of this market. Inferencing is the running of an AI application. In fiscal 2020, Nvidia's data center platform's revenue was $2.98 billion. It skyrocketed to $115.2 billion in fiscal 2025, equating to about a 107% compound annual growth rate (CAGR). This amazing growth powered the data center to account for 88% of Nvidia's total revenue in fiscal 2025, up from 27% in fiscal 2020. Status: My timeline was too optimistic. In March 2020, I wrote: \"In 2025, fully autonomous vehicles should be legal -- or very close to being so -- across the United States. Nvidia is well positioned to majorly profit from [this event].\" I wouldn't say that fully autonomous vehicles are \"very close\" to being legal across the U.S. This event seems at least a few years away. But I continue to believe this watershed event will \"turbocharge\" Nvidia's growth thanks to its widely adopted AI-powered DRIVE platform. Status: Correct. In March 2020, I wrote: \"Nvidia is incredibly innovative, so there seems a great chance that the company will introduce at least one major new technology that takes nearly everyone by surprise.\" Over the last five years, Nvidia has launched a good number of major new technologies that have likely taken most investors and Wall Street analysts by surprise. One example is its Omniverse platform, which launched in 2021. This is a simulation platform that enables the creation of virtual worlds and digital twins. It's been widely adopted by a broad industry range of large enterprise companies -- includingAmazon,PepsiCo, andBMW Group-- for uses such as designing products and optimizing facility workflow. Status: Correct. Here's what I wrote in March 2020: It's impossible to predict a company's stock price in five years because so many unknowns ... can have a huge influence on the market in general. That said, given the projections made in this article,I feel very comfortable predicting that Nvidia stock will solidly outperform the market over the next half decade. Stay tuned. I'm planning on a predictions article similar to my 2020 one. Hint: It's going to be optimistic, as Nvidia's highly profitable strong revenue growth is far from over, in my opinion.",

        "header": "Move Over Nvidia, Taiwan Semiconductor, and Micron. Brad Gerstner's Altimeter Capital Just Gave Investors 2,999,536 Reasons to Check Out the Hottest Artificial Intelligence (AI) IPO Stock of 2025",
        "content": "Brad Gerstner is the founder and CEO of hedge fund Altimeter Capital. Some of his more notable wins include being an early investor in data cloud companySnowflakeand Asian ridehailing leaderGrab. As is the case with many investment funds, Altimeter has made artificial intelligence (AI) stocks a core feature of its portfolio in recent years. According to its most recent13F filing, Altimeter trimmed its stake inNvidiaduring the first quarter while completely dumping its stakes inMicronandTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. Interestingly, though, I discovered that Altimeter holds a position in red-hot AI IPO stockCoreWeave(CRWV-17.13%). This comes from an investment Altimeter made when CoreWeave was still a private company. As of the close of trading on June 4, Altimeter's 2,999,536 shares were worth about $489 million Let's explore some of the core themes in the ongoing AI revolution to try and discern what may have motivated these moves. From there, I'll break down CoreWeave's business and recent price action to help determine if the stock is a good buy right now. Considering how robust demand has been for high-endgraphics processing units(GPU) and memory storage chips, reducing exposure to names such as Nvidia, Micron, and Taiwan Semi looks like a head-scratcher on the surface. However, this is not the first time that Gerstner has shown somecontrariancharacteristics in his investment style. While I cannot say for certain what Altimeter's current thesis is regarding chip stocks or the AI movement more broadly, I've come up with some reasons that may help justify the fund's recent moves. According to industry estimates, Nvidia currently controls roughly 90% (or more) of thedata center GPU market. While a lead like that might suggest Nvidia's moat is insurmountable, there are some risks to consider. First, Nvidia's revenue sources are heavily concentrated among cloud hyperscalers such asAmazon,Alphabet, andMicrosoft. Each of these companies has been developing their own custom AI chips, potentially signaling their intentions to migrate away from Nvidia's architecture over time. When you layer on top that the fact thatAdvanced Micro Deviceshas steadily been gaining momentum in the data center arena -- as its deals withOracle, Microsoft, andMeta Platformsdemonstrate -- Nvidia's growth could be on course for some deceleration. Lastly, one of the storm clouds hanging over Nvidia at the moment is itsexposure to China. New U.S. export controls and President Donald Trump's tariffs could cut into its sales there. Micron operates in a unique pocket of the AI realm. It specializes in memory storage chips, which are vital hardware for data centers, personal computers, and smartphones, among other technologies. With that said, memory chips are relativelycommoditized. On top of that, a shift toward cloud-based AI infrastructure could potentially serve as a headwind for Micron's hardware-centric chip memory business. Taiwan Semiconductor specializes in fabrication services -- its foundries are where chips designed by Nvidia, AMD,Broadcom, and a host of others are actually manufactured. While demand for GPUs and other types of AI chips is strong, a deceleration in sales growth from key customers (i.e., Nvidia) could trickle down to TSMC's business, too. Furthermore, most of TSMC's factories are located in Taiwan. Given the ongoing geopolitical pressures Taiwan faces from China, it's possible that U.S. chip designers like AMD or Nvidia could begin to turn to alternative foundry providers such asIntel. Image Source: Getty Images. CoreWeave is a cloud computing infrastructure provider that offers its clients access to Nvidia GPUs and a host of other chip integrations. As such, its business is not as exposed to the time it takes to design and manufacture sophisticated hardware -- unlike the names explored above. In a way, this makes the hyperscaler more nimble than other chip and data center stocks, allowing the company to scale at a faster pace. CoreWeave is able to take advantage of the booming chip landscape but more so on theAI trainingandinferencingside. Ultimately, it fills the gap between producing chipsets and accessing optimized AI cloud infrastructure. It's not that Nvidia, Micron, or TSMC are poor investment choices right now. It's simply that those businesses might be reaching levels of maturity, whereas CoreWeave's model could be in the early phases of exponential expansion. The chart below illustrates how CoreWeave'sprice-to-sales(P/S) ratio has progressed since its initial public offering (IPO) earlier this year.  CRWV PS Ratiodata byYCharts There are a couple of big takeaways from this chart. First, it's clear that CoreWeave has experienced notablevaluation expansion. In my view, outsize momentum is propelling CoreWeave stock right now -- and buying in the wake of its recent climb could leave you as an unsuspectingbag holder. In addition, CoreWeave's P/S multiple is almost fourfold that of Oracle -- which also provides core data center infrastructure services. Oracle is a mature, profitable business, unlike CoreWeave's high-cash-burn operation. While I understand the thesis behind CoreWeave's value proposition in the AI landscape, I think the stock is overbought right now. I would pass on investing at its current valuation, but would keep tabs on the company and its growth prospects.",

        "content": "Tesla (TSLA) shares plunged on Thursday, pushing the EV maker out of theexclusive $1 trillion clubamid anintensifying spat between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump. In recent days,Musk had criticized a sprawling tax and spending billcurrently before Congress, prompting the president on Thursday to express disappointment in the billionaire, who then fired back with a series of social media posts that sparked further reaction from Trump. Investors fear theescalating tension between the paircould lead Trump to axe funding and subsidies, and to block regulatory approval, for Musk\u2019s businesses, including Tesla. Tesla shares dropped 14% on Thursday to close at around $285, wiping out a sizable portion of the gains that the stock had posted after Musk said in late April that he planned to step away from his role as head of the government's Department of Government Efficiency tospend more time at the automaker. Below, we take a closer look at Tesla\u2019s chart and applytechnical analysisto identify major price levels that investors will likely be watching. Since bottoming out in early April, Tesla shares staged acountertrendrally within arising wedge. However, the price broke down from the pattern this week, indicating a resumption of the stock\u2019s longer-termdowntrendthat started in December. In recent days, selling has accelerated, with the price closing below both the 50- and 200-day moving averages in Thursday\u2019s trading session, a move that coincided with therelative strength indexfalling sharply below its neutral threshold towardoversoldterritory. Moreover, today's drop occurred on heavyvolume, signaling that larger market participants drove the selling. Let\u2019s identify three major price levels on Tesla\u2019s chart where the shares could encountersupportand also locate a key overhead area to watch during future upswings. The first major support level to watch sits around $265. The shares may attract buying interest in this region near a range of trading activity within the rising wedge pattern and severalpeaksthat developed on the chart last year between July and October. A close below this level could see the shares fall to $215. This area may provide support near ahorizontal linethat connects a series ofprice actionon the chart stretching back to last July. The location also closely aligns with a projected bars pattern target that takes the stock\u2019s steep move lower from late March to early April and repositions it from the rising wedge pattern\u2019sbreakdownpoint. Tesla bulls\u2019 failure to defend this major level opens the door for a retest of lower support at $170. Investors may view this area as a potential trading floor near a period ofsideways driftthat formed on the chart throughout May and June last year. During upswings in Tesla\u2019s share price, investors should closely monitor the $365 area.

        "content": "What would you get in the\u2014unlikely, to be sure\u2014event that your employer was sold and every worker got an equal share of the take? For Nvidia employees, we're talking millions and millions of dollars. Nvidia (NVDA), the world\u2019s most valuable company, is worth about $3.5 trillion. With just 36,000 employees, itsmarket capitalizationper employee stands at above $90 million.\u00a0That's nearly three times competitor Broadcom's (AVGO) per-employee value, and it dwarfs Apple's (AAPL) $18 million and Microsoft's (MSFT) $15 million. These figures were recently crunched by Deutsche Bank research strategist Jim Reid, who wondered: \u201cAre today\u2019s largest companies structurally employing fewer people than in the past?\u201d To answer that question, Reid looked back at some of America\u2019s most valuable companies since 1950 and their respective headcounts when their value was at its peak.\u00a0One might assume there's been a structural shift toward smaller employee rolls as technological advancements improved efficiency, but history suggests \"employment density\" at America's biggest companies goes through cycles. General Motors (GM), America\u2019s largest company in the 1950s, employed about 600,000 people at its peak. Just years later, in the late '60s, Eastman Kodak surpassed GM in market value with just one-sixth of the workforce. In the '70s,General Electricemployed about 400,000 people. These are enormous workforces compared with Nvidia\u2019s, which from a market cap per employee perspective is in a league of its own, Reid says. But a few companies with headcounts comparable with Nvidia\u2019s have become the world\u2019s most valuable. Oil company Amoco\u2019s margins were padded by elevated oil prices in the late 1970s, helping its market cap surge with only about 50,000 workers. Cisco is the historical example that most resemblesNvidia. Like Cisco in the late '90s, Nvidia is \u201coperationally lean, highly reliant on\u00a0intellectual property and engineering talent, andoutsourcesthe more labour-intensive aspects of production,\" wrote Reid. The analysis could offer some relief to those concerned that the proliferation of artificial intelligence will result in mass unemployment as AI agents androbotsreplace human workers. \"What\u2019s clear through history is that while\u00a0we\u2019ve always found ways to employ people, how they\u2019re distributed across firms and sectorsis constantly evolving,\u201d Reid wrote.",

        "content": "Signs of progress on US tariff agreements in early May offered some reprieve around trade tensions, prompting investors to be more \"risk-on\", driving stock markets higher. Following on from US president Donald Trump's pausing of many higher rate tariffs in April, theUK and US announced a trade dealon 8 May. This marked the Trump administration's first pact since it unveiled sweeping tariffs and included an agreement to lower levies on a certain number of UK car exports, among other points. Days later, the US and China announced that they had agreed to temporarily slash tariffs on each other's imports by 115% for 90 days, marking a major de-escalation in tensions between the two countries. However, the break from tensions was short-lived, as on 23 May Trump then threatened to raise tariffs to 50% on imports from the European Union (EU) and to put a25% levy on Apple(AAPL) products unless iPhones are made in the US. Following conversations with European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, Trump then said a few days later he had decided to hit pause on imposing higher tariffs on the EU until 9 July. Read more:ECB cuts interest rates for eighth time in a year Later last week, a US trade court then moved to block Trump from imposing his sweeping tariffs, having ruled that the presidentexceeded his authoritywhen he used an emergency law to issue global reciprocal tariffs on US trading partners. A day later, however, an appeals court temporarily halted this order, allowing Trump to keep collecting tariffs for now. Capping off the month's trade developments, Trump said that he would double tariffs to 50% on imports of steel and aluminium. On the same day, Trump also claimed China had \"totally violated\" its trade truce with the US, an accusation which China fired back at Washington on Monday. After a call with China's president Xi Jinping on Thursday, however, both countriespledged to restart tariff and trade talksin the coming days. At the end of the month, investors were also focused on Nvidia's (NVDA) first quarter earnings, which came out on 28 May. Expectations have become increasingly high around the chipmaker's earnings, but the results appeared to pass muster this time round, with shares rising on the back of their release. In fact, the Magnificent 7 \u2013 comprised of Nvidia, as well as Tesla (TSLA), Meta (META), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG,GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN) \u2013 wereresponsible for 62% of the S&P 500's(^GSPC) gains in May, according to financial research firm DataTrek. This contributed to the US blue-chip index clocking its best month of trading in May since 1990, though it is still less than 1% in the green year-to-date. Other markets also continued to rebound on tariff progress last month, with the UK's FTSE 100 (^FTSE) now up nearly 8% year-to-date, while the pan-European STOXX 600 (^STOXX) has advanced 9.3% so far this year. With that mind, here were the most popular stocks and funds with investors last month. Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, said: \"May was an easier ride for investors, even though market movements continue to be dominated by tariff twists and turns.\" \u201cThe early announcement of a trade deal between the US and the UK gave rise to hopes that others could follow in short order, although subsequent events put paid to that optimism,\" he said. \"A court ruling that the tariffs were not legal was replaced by a temporary removal of that blockage, while in the final weekend in May the aggressive rhetoric towards other trading partners resumed.\" Oil major BP (BP.L) topped the most bought lists for Interactive Investor, Hargreaves Lansdown and Bestinvest, with investors appearing to take advantage of the fact that shares are trading at their lowest point in three years. Shares fell after BP (BP.L) reported that profits almost halved in the first quarter. The company reported an underlying replacement cost profit \u2013 a key metric used as a proxy for net profit \u2013 of $1.38bn (\u00a31.02bn), falling short of the $1.53bn forecast by analysts polled by LSEG (LSEG.L). The figure also marks a 49% decline from the $2.7bn posted in the same period last year. Read more:UK 'bargain' stocks that have outperformed the market long-term The company has come under pressure from the decline in oil prices, which have fallen amid concerns that a tariff-induced economic slowdown would weigh on demand for fuel. Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \"BP's shares came under more pressure after its first set of quarterly results since its strategy reset unimpressed the market. \"Despite reductions in costs and investment expenditure, debt moved in the wrong direction. But plenty of investors appear hopeful that the transformation plan will start to bear fruit and have been buying shares in the hope of an uplift.\" Chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) remained another top 10 stock buy for investors on Interactive Investor, Hargreaves Lansdown, Robinhood (HOOD) and Bestinvest's platforms. Following a drop in Nvidia's (NVDA) share price in April, as Trump's trade war ramped up, the stock recovered in May amid the reprieve on tariffs. The stock then climbed higher towards the end of the month, after the companyunveiled a number of new technologies at the Computextech expo in Taiwan, including developments around its robotics capabilities, among other updates. Stocks:Create your watchlist and portfolio This came a week before the Nvidia's (NVDA) update on its first quarter performance, which have become the most highly anticipated results of the earnings season, given the chipmaker's role as an enabler of AI. For the first quarter, Nvidia (NVDA) posted revenue of $44.1bn, which topped estimates of $43.3bn, though earnings per share of $0.81 were below expectations of $0.93. Shares popped on the back of the results, despite Nvidia (NVDA) warning of a $4.5bn charge from controls on its exports of its H20 chips to China. Excluding this charge, Nvidia (NVDA) said that earnings per share would have been $0.96 for the first quarter. \"There remains significant appetite for chip star Nvidia (NVDA), given the demand for its products to power the AI revolution keeps powering upwards,\" said Streeter. \"The company beat revenue expectations again last month, despite fresh restrictions on its exports to China.\" Investors continued to put money behind defence stocks last month, a trade which has become popular as European governments have pledged to spend more on this area. FTSE 100-listed firm Rolls-Royce (RR.L) remained one of the most popular stocks for investors in May, appearing on the lists of Interactive Investor, Hargreaves Lansdown and Bestinvest. BAE System (BA.L) also appeared on Hargreaves Lansdown and Bestinvest's lists, as another UK-listed company in the sector. \"There\u2019s an expectation that the EU-UK trade deal will open up deep new pools of funding for British defence companies, as efforts are made to counter the heightened threat from Russia,\" said Streeter. Investors also continued to invest in Strategy Incorporated (MSTR), the software firm which is the world's largest corporate holder of bitcoin (BTC-USD). \"It was an up-and-down month for MSTR with bitcoin highs supporting the share price, only for valuation concerns to take the shine off the crypto rise,\" said Robinhood (HOOD) UK lead analyst Dan Lane. \"Robinhood (HOOD) UK investors are keeping the faith for now, with Coinbase (COIN) on the radar too after being included in the S&P 500 index during the month.\" UK high street stalwart Marks & Spencer (MKS.L) was another stock that investors appeared to take the opportunity to snap up amid a knock to its share price. The stock was on the most bought lists of Interactive Investor, Hargreaves Lansdown, Bestinvest and AJ Bell (AJB.L) in May. \"Marks and Spencer\u2019s (MKS.L) cyber-attack disrupted stores and online ordering, causing a 16% drop in shares before starting to recover mid-month,\" said Hargreaves' Streeter. \"Sentiment has been helped by an update showing the retailer is fighting to restore its systems from a position of resilience after a 22% uplift in underlying pre-tax annual profit.\" Passive funds continued to dominate platforms most bought lists, with US and global funds accounting for many of investors' popular choices. Funds that appeared on multiple lists, included Vanguard FTSE Global All Cap Index (0P00018XAR.L) and HSBC FTSE All World Index (0P00013P6I.L), which are exposed to the Mag 7 tech giants, among other major global companies. Read more:Stocks that are trending today While markets did see a recovery last month, Hargreaves Lansdown head of fund research Victoria Hasler said that \"volatility abounded in May, with more tariff drama, cyber attacks and economic uncertainty.\" \"This led some investors to turn to active managers to navigate the difficult environment, and the Artemis Global Income fund topped our list of most bought funds,\" she said. \"Income strategies generally tend to be a little more defensive than the market as a whole, and the Artemis fund has a value bias which could have attracted investors. The other active fund in the top ten was also a global offering \u2013 the Rathbone Global Opportunities fund.\" Read more: How next week's spending review could impact your finances What is the Pension Investment Review?

        "header": "Jensen Huang Just Delivered Incredible News for Nvidia Stock Investors",
        "content": "Nvidia(NVDA1.53%)is the world's leading supplier of graphics processing units (GPUs) for data centers, which are the key pieces of hardware for developing artificial intelligence (AI). Since the beginning of 2023, Nvidia's market value has grown by an eye-popping $3 trillion thanks to soaring demand for those chips, but the company is just getting warmed up. Every new generation of AI model so far has required significantly more computing capacity than the last, which is a major tailwind for Nvidia's hardware sales. During a recent conference call where management discussed the company's results for the fiscal 2026 first quarter (ended April 27), CEO Jensen Huang made a series of comments about future demand that should be music to investors' ears. Nvidia stock looks attractive right now relative to its history, so here's why it could be a great buy on the back of Huang's latest remarks. Image source: Nvidia. Nvidia's H100GPU, which was built on the company's Hopper architecture, was the top-selling data center chip for AI development during 2023 and for most of 2024. It was designed for bothtrainingandinferenceworkloads; training is when developers feed mountains of data into AI models to make them \"smarter,\" and inference is the process by which AI models turn that data into responses for the end user. In 2023 and 2024,AI chatbot applicationswere great at generating one-shot responses, meaning they prioritized speed when compiling information and feeding it to the end user. Those applications were revolutionary at the time, but the underlyinglarge language models(LLMs) occasionally made mistakes or provided incomplete answers. In 2025, next-generation \"reasoning\" models are solving that problem by autonomously cleaning up errors in the background before rendering responses. To put it another way, they spend time thinking to ensure the information they provide is as accurate as possible. This comes with a downside -- reasoning models take longer to generate answers, and they require significantly more computing capacity than their predecessors. Nvidia designed a new architecture called Blackwell to power those inference workloads, and it produces up to 40 times more performance than the Hopper architecture. But it might not be enough, because Huang says some reasoning models consume a staggering 1,000 times more tokens (words, punctuation, and symbols) than the old one-shot LLMs. Huang says the Blackwell-based GB200 GPU NVLink 72 is the best system on the market for reasoning inference workloads right now, but Nvidia is also gearing up to ship its new Blackwell Ultra GB300 GPUs this year, which will offer even more performance. Hardware needs to keep getting better; otherwise, reasoning models will take too long to generate responses, and people simply won't use them anymore. Nvidia'sdata centerbusiness generated $39.1 billion inrevenueduring the fiscal 2026 first quarter, a 73% increase from the year-ago period. It now accounts for 89% of the company's total revenue, so it's the main point of focus for investors. At Nvidia's GTC conference in March, Huang told the audience thatAIinfrastructure spending will keep growing and could surpass $1 trillion annually by 2028, thanks to the incredible demand for inference computing capacity from reasoning models. Then, in his conference call with investors for the fiscal 2026 first quarter, he said Nvidia is on track to fill \"most\" of that demand, so the company's data center revenue probably still has room to soar. Nvidia's hardware remains leaps and bounds ahead of the competition. Plus, it isn't just about chips -- the company has the entire stack covered, selling networking equipment and even a software platform called CUDA, which developers can use to optimize GPUs for specific tasks. Once data center operators are locked into the Nvidia ecosystem, it becomes very inconvenient (and expensive) to switch. Based on Nvidia's $3.19 in trailing-12-monthearnings per share(EPS), its stock is trading at aprice-to-earnings (P/E) ratioof 44.3. That's a 26% discount to its 10-year average of 59.8, suggesting it's undervalued right now. Plus, Wall Street's consensus estimate (provided by Yahoo! Finance) suggests Nvidia will generate $4.28 in EPS for the whole of fiscal 2026, placing its stock at aforward P/E ratioof just 32.1.  NVDA PE Ratiodata byYCharts In other words, Nvidia stock would have to soar by 38% over the next year or so just to maintain its current P/E ratio, or by 86% for its P/E ratio to trade in line with its 10-year average, assuming Wall Street's EPS forecast proves to be accurate. However, investors should stay focused on the longer term, because if Jensen Huang is right about where inference demand and data center spending are headed, Nvidia's stock could be orders of magnitude higher than where it is today.",

        "header": "Meet the Monster Stock That Continues to Crush the Market",
        "content": "CoreWeave(CRWV-17.13%), a provider of dedicated artificial intelligence (AI) cloud infrastructure services, launched its initial public offering (IPO) on March 28 at $40 a share. Its stock barely budged after the IPO, but it warmed up in April, heated up even more throughout May, and now trades at about $156 per share. During that same period, theS&P 500only rose 7% as theNasdaq Compositeadvanced 12%. Let's see why CoreWeave's stock more than quadrupled in just over two months -- and if it's still worth chasing today. CoreWeave was founded in 2017 as a cryptocurrency miner that purchased large quantities of GPUs to mineEthereum. But after the cryptocurrency crash of 2018, it abandoned the crypto mining market and leveraged its large inventory of GPUs to build acloud infrastructureplatform for processingAI tasks. Image source: Getty Images. In 2022, it spent about $100 million to installNvidia's(NVDA-1.44%)high-end H100 GPUs in its data centers. That massive investment paid off as the explosive growth of the AI market -- and the high costs of purchasing Nvidia's GPUs -- prompted more companies to rent CoreWeave's cloud-based GPUs to power their latest AI applications. CoreWeave also used its GPUs as collateral to secure billions of dollars in additional financing. CoreWeave's dedicated AI cloud infrastructure services differentiate it from bigger and more broadly diversified public cloud platforms likeAmazonWeb Services (AWS) orMicrosoft(MSFT0.69%)Azure. It claims that its dedicated approach makes it about 35 times faster and 80% cheaper than traditional cloud platforms for AI tasks. That disruptive approach attracted the attention of some big investors like Nvidia,Cisco Systems, andPureStorage, which paved the way for its market debut this year. CoreWeave now operates 33 data centers across the U.S. and Europe, up from 15 centers in 2024, 14 centers in 2023, and just three centers in 2022. Its revenue skyrocketed from $16 million in 2022 to $229 million in 2023, then surged again to $1.92 billion in 2024. In the first quarter of 2025, its revenue surged a whopping 420% year over year to $982 million. It had a revenue backlog of $25.9 billion, including a new $11.2 billion contract with OpenAI. However, CoreWeave's net loss widened from $31 million in 2022 to $594 million in 2023, then widened again to $863 million in 2024. Its operating expenses are soaring as it buys and leases more data centers, purchases more data center GPUs for Nvidia, and absorbs its higher energy fees. Its net loss more than doubled year over year to $315 million in the first quarter of 2025. A lot of CoreWeave's expansion has been driven by big debt offerings, which caused its annual interest payments to reach $361 million in 2023 and $584 million in 2024. It ended the first quarter of 2025 with $18.8 billion in total liabilities, which gives it an alarmingly high debt-to-equity ratio of 9.9. It still had nearly $1.3 billion in unrestricted cash and equivalents, but it could burn through that cash quickly and need to take on even more debt as it opens more data centers. It also plans to spend a lot more money on Nvidia's newest Blackwell GPUs. Another issue is its dependence on Microsoft, which accounted for a whopping 62% of its revenue in 2024. That customer concentration is troubling since it erodes its pricing power while giving Microsoft leverage in negotiating lower fees. It will also generate a lot of revenue from its new deal with OpenAI, but it hasn't disclosed those exact figures yet. For the full year, CoreWeave expects its revenue to more than double to between $4.9 billion and $5.1 billion. But with a market cap of $77.4 billion, the stock already trades at 15 times that estimate. It's not quite ameme stockyet, but that high price-to-sales ratio could limit its upside potential. CoreWeave might be worth nibbling on right now if you're bullish on the AI market's growth potential. However, you should also remember that it's shouldering a lot of debt, burning a lot of cash, and doesn't plan to break even anytime soon.",

        "header": "Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Serve Robotics, Uber Technologies and Nvidia",
        "content": "Chicago, IL \u2013 June 6, 2025 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Serve Robotics Inc. SERV, Uber Technologies UBER and Nvidia NVDA. Few investors have even heard ofServe Robotics Inc., yet the coming weeks could push this micro-cap onto every AI and robotics watch-list. Spun out ofUber Technologiesin 2021, the company\u2019s bright-blue sidewalk robots have already logged tens of thousands of autonomous deliveries, but the real inflection point is just ahead. Management has begun a nationwide roll-out with Uber Eats, most recently adding the Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex, and is racing toward a contractual goal of deploying 2,000 units before year-end. SERV stock has been on a rocky path over the last two years, marked by fits of big rallies, selloffs and high volatility. But now, it appears the catalysts are aligning. Along with the Uber rollout, Serve sales growth is expected to inflect significantly higher in the coming quarters, while the stock price is building powerful momentum. With the robotics theme really grabbing attention in the last couple of weeks, and the technology suddenly gaining practical application, Serve Robotics Inc. stock may be about to take off. Although Serve Robotics still operates at a loss, sales are expected to meaningfully pick up over the next year. Current year sales are forecast to come in around $5 million, while next year is expected to jump 670% to $41.2 million. However, with the unprecedented opportunity ahead in the robotics industry, even those forecasts could be understated. Notably, Serve Robotics is hosting an annual meeting on June 12th, which could mark a major announcement and add to the upside catalysts in the stock. I began writing about the opportunities in robotics stocks just a couple of weeks ago as the theme is quickly picking up steam. While high-profile names likeNvidiaare the obvious plays, lesser-known companies like Serve Robotics offer investors a non-consensus way to capture more asymmetric upside in this rapidly evolving space. That said, Nvidia remains a core opportunity. The company has made its ambitions in robotics clear, aiming to dominate the category just as it has in artificial intelligence. Its expanding microprocessor platform is designed to power everything from warehouse bots to autonomous delivery systems, placing Nvidia at the center of the AI-robotics-automation nexus. Meanwhile, Uber Technologies has quietly become one of the most forward-thinking players in automation. Through its partnership with Serve Robotics for sidewalk delivery and its growing relationship with Waymo on the ride-hailing front, Uber is leveraging cutting-edge technology to redefine logistics. As I have noted, SERV stock has really begun to pick up steam in the last couple of months. After bottoming in early April, along with the broader market, the stock has gone on a quick 130% run. Over the last few days, SERV has been forming a clear technical bull flag, highlighting a potentially opportune time to start buying the stock. If it can trade materially above the $12.30 level, it would signal a technical breakout, and could lead to another sustained bull run. Serve Robotics Inc. isn\u2019t for the faint of heart. As a small-cap stock with limited liquidity and a short trading history, SERV has been prone to dramatic price swings. However, for those who can stomach the ups and downs, SERV may represent one of the most compelling high-risk, high-reward opportunities in the AI and robotics space. The company is targeting a real, tangible use case, last-mile delivery, and is executing alongside a blue-chip partner in Uber Technologies. Sales growth is accelerating, momentum is building, and investor awareness is only just beginning to catch up. In a market hungry for the next big breakthrough, Serve Robotics offers something rare: early-stage exposure to a real-world robotics deployment with massive scaling potential. For speculative investors looking to ride the next wave of automation, this stock may be worth a serious look. Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of+48.4%, +50.2%and+56.7%per year.

        "header": "Does the Nasdaq Composite Still Have Room to Run?",
        "content": "Over the past couple of years, investors have rushed to get in on the next big thing in technology: artificial intelligence (AI). To do this, they've piled into shares of companies developing or using AI, and this movement has benefited the tech-heavyNasdaq Composite(^IXIC1.24%). The benchmark soared 84% from the start of 2023 through the end of last year. But, earlier this year, investor concerns about the impact of President Donald Trump's import tariffs on the economy halted that momentum, and the Nasdaq slid into bear territory. In recent weeks, though, investors have become more optimistic about growth amid certain encouraging signs -- for example, the U.S. reached an initial trade deal with China at lower-then-expected tariff levels. As a result, the Nasdaq has rebounded, erasing this year's losses and trading near its record high. Now, the question is, from here, does the Nasdaq still have room to run? Let's find out. Image source: Getty Images. First, let's take a step back and consider the AI movement that drove the Nasdaq gains of the past two years. Companies producing crucial AI development tools, like chip designerNvidia(NVDA1.53%)and networking giantBroadcom, advanced, as did players using these AI products to build out infrastructure -- and here a good example isMeta Platforms, a company that plans as much as $72 billion in capital spending this year. These and other players involved in AI helped the Nasdaq gallop higher, reaching new record highs multiple times. To answer our question regarding the Nasdaq's potential for gains from its current level, it's key to look at two things: the element that could power share momentum and the index's historical performance. We'll start with the possible catalyst. That continues to be AI, and it's joined by another exciting technology:quantum computing, with pure play companies likeRigetti Computingor larger tech giants such asAlphabetdeveloping such programs. Though AI has driven significant gains in corporate revenue and share prices in recent years, we're actually in the early days of this technology's story. Analysts expect the market, at a compound annual growth rate of 30%, to reach more than $2 trillion in less than 10 years. We should keep in mind that the AI buildout is far from over -- and the actualapplication of AIto real world problems may drive many years of growth for AI companies. Quantum computing, too, is in its early stages, and progress in the field has resulted in gains for the tech companies involved -- and, as a result, the Nasdaq too. This technology involves the use of quantum mechanics to solve problems today's computers are unable to handle. Now, a quick look at what history has to say about the Nasdaq. As you can see in the following chart, the Nasdaq over time always has gone on to reach new highs -- it's never halted at a certain level and remained permanently lower.  ^IXICdata byYCharts So, the potential of the AI and quantum computing stories along with the index's historical behavior suggest that, from today's level, it has plenty of room to run. How can you benefit from this? In a couple of different ways. You could select a variety of quality Nasdaq stocks that today trade at a discount compared to their average valuations over the past couple of years. Nvidia, trading at 33 timesforward earnings estimates, is a good example -- over most of the past year, it's traded above 40 times these estimates. You also might consider a fund -- such as theFidelity Nasdaq Composite ETF(ONEQ1.18%)-- that tracks the index's performance. These exchange-traded funds trade daily just like a stock, making it easy to add them to your portfolio. Another option is hand-picking a few Nasdaq stocks and investing in an ETF that tracks the index too, so you can potentially benefit directly from certain players and also gain broad exposure to the entire benchmark. Importantly, no matter which option you choose, get ready to hold on for at least five years. Long-term investing offers companies and indexes time to manage difficult environments and excel during better times -- and that could equal a big investing win for you over the long run as the Nasdaq still has plenty of room to run.",

        "content": "(Reuters) - Broadcom (AVGO) shares fell nearly 4% in premarket trading on Friday, after the company's third-quarter revenue forecast failed to impress investors who have been extremely bullish on chip stocks amid an artificial intelligence boom. The Palo Alto, California-based company, which supplies semiconductors to Apple and Samsung, provides advanced networking gear that allows vast amounts of data to travel across AI data centers, making its chips crucial for the development of generative AI technology. Broadcom forecast third-quarter revenue of around $15.80 billion, compared with analysts' average estimate of $15.71 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG. \"High expectations drove a bit of downside,\" Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said in a note. Broadcom also helps design custom AI processors for large cloud providers, which compete against Nvidia's (NVDA) pricey off-the-shelf chips. Global chipmakers, including Nvidia, have been vulnerable to U.S. President Donald Trump's shifting trade policy and export curbs as Washington attempts to limit Beijing's access to advanced U.S. technology. \"AVGO is ramping two additional customers, but they are still small. So the processor business will grow this year, but at a measured rate,\" said Morgan Stanley (MS). Last week, rival Marvell Technology forecast second-quarter revenue above Wall Street estimate, betting on strong demand for its custom chips powering AI workload in data centers. Broadcom's valuation had crossed $1 trillion for the first time in December after it forecast massive expansion in demand for chips that power AI. Its shares have risen about 12% so far this year. It has a 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio of 35.36, compared with Marvell's 20.63, according to data compiled by LSEG.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Microsoft Corp. MSFT, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. TSM, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL and Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN. NVIDIA Corp.recently achieved a milestone, following double-digit revenue growth in the fiscal 2026 first quarter and a business boom. Let\u2019s explore this achievement and consider the NVDA stock\u2019s potential for investment. On Tuesday, NVIDIA surpassedMicrosoft Corp.to regain the title of the world\u2019s most valuable company. NVIDIA\u2019s shares continued to rally on Wednesday, with the Jensen Huang-led company\u2019s market capitalization currently at $3.461 trillion. NVIDIA stock rose by over 50% from its low in April, leading to a market capitalization increase of over $1 trillion as investors showed renewed confidence. NVIDIA\u2019s shares have experienced periods of volatility this year due to investor concerns about the sustainability of artificial intelligence (AI) demand and the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs. However, better-than-expected first-quarter revenues, despite losing billions in sales due to the U.S. export ban on China, powered NVIDIA\u2019s shares. For the quarter, NVIDIA posted revenues of $44.1 billion, exceeding analysts\u2019 expectations of $43.3 billion and significantly more than $26 billion in the same period last year. NVIDIA successfully overcame supply-chain bottlenecks to deliver its cutting-edge Blackwell AI servers to big cloud customers, including Microsoft. NVIDIA\u2019s primary contract chip manufacturer,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd., or TSMC, confirmed strong AI chip demand. All these developments also helped NVIDIA\u2019s shares trade in positive territory for the year, up 5.4% year to date. To enhance AI computing capabilities, cloud computing companiesAlphabet Inc.andAmazon.com, Inc., to name a few, are purchasing graphics processing units (GPUs), where NVIDIA has more than a 90% market share, according to IoT Analytics. This wide moat should continue to bolster growth. Moreover, the increase in popularity of the CUDA software platform among developers and the growing demand for the Blackwell chips due to their faster AI interface are expected to boost NVIDIA\u2019s growth. At the same time, NVIDIA stands to benefit from the AI revolution in autonomous robots and self-driving cars.Amazon employs NVIDIA\u2019s Isaac to train warehouse robots. NVIDIA\u2019s increasing value, rise in first-quarter revenues, growing AI data center spending, demand for its latest chip and GPU, and potential growth in automotive revenues should encourage stakeholders to stay invested in NVDA stock. Additionally, keeping NVDA stock due to its strong fundamentals makes sense as the company\u2019s net profit margin of 55.7% outperformed the Semiconductor - General industry\u2019s 49.5%. However, the U.S. government has restricted NVIDIA from selling its H20 chips to the Chinese market, which could impact the company\u2019s revenue growth vis-\u00e0-vis its stock performance in the future. Therefore, new entrants should wait and watch for any progress in this area before making a bet on NVDA stock. For now, NVIDIA has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

        "header": "2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Look Like Buffett-Style Long-Term Bets",
        "content": "Warren Buffett, the longtime CEO ofBerkshire Hathaway, is famous for his long-term bets. Many of his biggest investments have been in his portfolio for decades. Right now, the AI revolution is creating lucrative multidecade opportunities for growth, allowing investors to replicate Buffett's patient strategy with high-growth stocks. When it comes to AI stocks,Nvidiais king. The company is the leading manufacturer ofgraphics processing units, or GPUs-- specialized chips that make machine learning and artificial intelligence training and execution possible. Nvidia's highly sought-after GPUs gives it an estimated market share of around 90% for AI applications. The company also posts industry-leading gross margins, demonstrating its technological superiority and reputation for quality. With AI spending expected to rise by more than 30% annually over the long term, Nvidia will continue to be at the center of the AI revolution, supplying the industry with the critical components it needs to survive and thrive. As previous chip wars have demonstrated, however, Nvidia's lead won't last forever. It may still grow its sales and profits tremendously over the next decade thanks to underlying market growth and a durable software advantage. But over time, expect other companies to compete on price and performance, particularly in niche areas that aren't as lucrative for Nvidia right now. One Buffett-style value pick right now looks to beIntel(INTC-1.46%). Intel is losing the AI war right now, with an inferior offering and lackluster gross profit levels. But shares are priced according to that reality.  NVDA PS Ratiodata byYCharts It's going to be a long road for Intel. Years of poor investment and ill-advised acquisitions have squandered a once-promising lead in GPU manufacturing. But management is trying to turn things around. The company is spending billions to improve its AI offerings and may have a chance to penetrate the market with energy-saving chips, even if those chips are inferior from a raw performance standpoint compared to Nvidia's offerings. Will Intel turn things around any time soon? It's not likely. But those willing to take Buffett-style, long-term approaches could be getting a bargain valuation on a stock that could re-emerge as an AI winner a decade down the line. Image source: Getty Images. Right now, Buffett's holding company owns $2 billion worth of shares in a company that is dominating AI:Amazon(AMZN0.26%). But wait a second -- isn't Amazon an e-commerce company? That's where most of its revenue is still generated. However, when it comes to operating profit, Amazon Web Services, or AWS, is actually the biggest contributor. AWS is a cloud infrastructure business. It's a huge purchaser of Nvidia's GPUs. By establishing server infrastructure around the world, AI developers can use AWS to dynamically scale their own infrastructure up and down at a moment's notice. It's by far the cheapest and fastest way to scale an AI business compared to every AI company that is building out its own infrastructure. Right now, AWS is the largest cloud provider in the world with an estimated 30% market share -- nearly as much as the next two competitors combined. This scale grants it the ability to better meet customer needs, with more server locations and options. But it also grants it higher capital spending power. Securing coveted AI chips like Nvidia's Blackwell infrastructure is pricey and challenging, given tight supply chains. Amazon's heavyweight status gives it a big step up in innovation, with a greater ability to reinvest to meet the rising demands of AI customers. To be sure, much of Amazon's current valuation is tied up in its e-commerce business. But Buffett and his lieutenants are clearly bullish on the AWS segment as well. There's arguably no better way to produce Buffett-style profits than by investing in leading AI businesses that Buffett himself is invested in.",

        "content": "Shares in gallium nitride (GaN) and silicon carbide (SiC)semiconductorcompanyNavitas Semiconductor(NVTS5.87%)rose by more than 18% in the week to Friday morning. The move follows another week of positive news flow for a stock that's now up 69% in 2025, after being down by more than 50% in the year to mid-April. There are no prizes for guessing that the surge for Navitas (a company with just $83.3 million in revenue in 2024)  comes from the announcement of a significant collaboration with a technology giant; in this case,Nvidia. In a late-May announcement, Navitasstated thatNvidia had selected it to collaborate on developing chips to support Nvidia's 800-volt high-voltage direct current (HVDC) data center infrastructure. The news sent the stock flying, as 800V HVDC data centers represent the next generation of data centers, planned to start in 2027. As such, investors are now eagerly following Navitas for news of any updates or new relationships with potential customers, and they received it this week with the announcement of a partnership with BrightLoop, a manufacturer of power electronics for high-performance applications.  In this case, Navitas will work with BrightLoop to support the development of hydrogen fuel-cell chargers for agricultural machinery. Image source: Getty Images. The developments are exciting and a validation of Navitas' technology. That said, there is still a long way to go before 800 V HCDV data centers are deployed, and Nvidia also has partnerships in place with powerful chip providers such asInfineon,STMicroelectronics, andTexas Instruments.  Still, for now, Navitas has a lot of positive momentum behind it, and that's why the market is bidding the stock up now.",

        "header": "Should Investors Bet on Intel's Turnaround In 2025?",
        "content": "Intel(INTC-1.46%)used to be the 800-pound gorilla ofthe semiconductor industry. These days, the company formerly known as Chipzilla has lost market share in its most important divisions and missed the bus to the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. At the same time, Intel is leaning into its relatively new chip manufacturing with a vengeance. Can Intel's updated strategy make up for the missteps in recent years? Is the stock poised for a turnaround in the next year or two? In short, is Intel stock a good buy right now? Let's find out. Intel's stock has been struggling for a few years. Share prices peaked at a two-decade high in April that year, before starting a long and painful downturn. The plunge began with Intel's Q1 2021 report, where the company crushed Wall Street's estimates but also revealed its brand-new chip foundry focus. It's fair to say that the so-called foundry business has been controversial from the start. The company spent more than $50 billion on new and upgraded chip-making facilities over the last two years. Those infrastructure costs are scaring away many prospective Intel investors. The foundry division isn't even turning a profit yet, and it faces tremendous competition from firmly established rivalsTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(TSM0.39%)andSamsung(SSNL.F9.01%). What if Intel's massive strategy-shifting investment turns out to be a dead end? That's the main reason why Intel's stock has fallen 70% from the April 2021 summit. Not even the generative AI upsurge can make up for this expensive idea in the average Intel shareholder's mind. Intel's Gaudi line of AI accelerators can compete withNvidia's(NVDA-1.44%)industry-standard cards by being far cheaper, allowing system builders to pack many more accelerators into each AI system. Beefy electric bills and boosted system cooling concerns can undermine Intel's cost advantage, using this approach. So an Intel investment in 2025 is a pretty direct long-term bet on the chip-making foundry business. Longtime challengerAdvanced Micro Devices(AMD-2.57%)has stolen Intel's thunder in the central processor unit (CPU) markets for PC and server systems. Nvidia is running away with the AI accelerator market, followed by a large pack of hungry up-and-comers. A turnaround is always possible, but this isn't even what Intel is working on nowadays. On that note, I think it's important to understand Intel's chip-making ambition. This market has been dominated by Taiwan Semiconductor for decades, with Samsung entering the large-scale arena more recently. Both companies are based in Southeast Asia, conveniently close to the tech manufacturing centers in China and Taiwan. But this geographic concentration is turning into a liability in 2025, as Chinese-American trade tensions keep flaring higher. So Intel could become the top supplier for American chip designers. Most of the company's chip-making facilities are scattered around the U.S., with large manufacturing campuses in places like Arizona and Oregon. Sending chip orders to these facilities will help domestic semiconductor companies (and their device-building clients) avoid tariffs and trade restrictions on processors made abroad. This isn't even a new development. Intel's foundry plan launched four years ago, amid the coronavirus-driven chip manufacturing shortage and an earlier version of today's amplified trade conflicts. Image source: Getty Images. I can't promise that Intel's foundry idea will work out in the long run. However, the semiconductor veteran has too much long-tenured expertise and too much money invested to take a wrong turn here. And the stock is priced for absolute disaster. Intel shares are changing hands at 1.7 times sales and 0.9 times the company's book value. That's bargain-bin territory in comparison to Intel's closest rivals: Semiconductor Stock Price to Sales (P/S) Price to Book (P/B) Market Cap Intel 1.7 0.9 $88.3 billion AMD 6.9 3.3 $192.3 billion Taiwan Semiconductor 10.9 7.6 $1,049.6 billion Nvidia 23.3 41.3 $3,462.9 billion Data taken from Finviz.com on June 4, 2025. I'm particularly intrigued by Intel's rock-bottomprice to book value. A figure below 1.0 suggests that investors might be better served if the company simply shut down its operations,sold all assets, and returned that cash to shareholders instead. Tax effects would make this an ineffective exit strategy in most cases, but you get the idea -- many investors have just given up hope for Intel. And I think that's a short-sighted view of Intel's updated strategy. In short, Intel's stock looks like a great buy at these low share prices.",

Tesla shares suffered on the news, falling 14% tocut more than $150 billionfrom the electric vehicle maker's market capitalization. Tesla shares are about 4.5% higher in premarket trading. U.S. employers areexpected to have added 125,000 jobs in Maywhen the monthly report is released at 8:30 a.m. ET today, according to economists surveyed byThe Wall Street JournalandDow Jones Newswires.That would be a slowdown from theunexpectedly high177,000 added in April. The report comes as some indications of weakness in the labor market have emerged. The private-sector ADP report released this week showedemployers added 37,000 jobs in May, the lowest level since March 2023 and below expectations. President Trump pointed to the weak report as he continued to pressure the Federal Reserve to cut rates. Broadcom (AVGO) shares are slipping about 2.5% in premarket trading after the chipmaker reported fiscal second-quarter results that werein line with analysts' expectations.The chipmaker reported adjustedearnings per share (EPS)of $1.58 on revenue that rose 20% year-over-year to a record $15.00 billion, both meeting Visible Alpha consensus estimates.

        "content": "You can catch Opening Bid onApple Podcasts,Spotify,YouTube, or wherever you get your podcasts. Wild movements in the bond market have been one of the biggest stories on Wall Street in 2025. In part, the climb in yields on US debt has reflected rising concerns about the country\u2019s fiscal position. Those worries have now been compounded by a new Trump tax bill that promises to add trillions to the US\u2019s already bloated deficit. While professionals say investors haven\u2019t lost trust in the US\u2019s ability to honor its debt, they will continue to demand higher yields to compensate for the rising risk. That could have major ramifications in markets for everything from the demand for Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) stock to housing. Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi talks on the Opening Bid podcast with BlackRock (BLK) Global Chief Investment Officer of Fixed Income Rick Rieder, one of the top minds in the bond market. Rieder reveals his latest thinking on fixed income as he manages $2.7 trillion in assets at BlackRock. Rieder also weighs in on the outlook for stocks in the face of what could be higher interest rates for longer from the Federal Reserve. Welcome to a new episode of the opening bid podcast. I'm Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sai. Like I always say, it's a podcast that will make you a smarter investor, period, and you are going to get much smarter because we have a great returning guest here, uh, on the pod. Rick Reader, BlackRock Global chief investment officer of Fixed income. Rick, good to see you, man. Good to see you. It's been a while. I know it's been a while. I of course I was joking to you off camera. I have not spent.I, I, my career spans over 20 years. I've spent more time in the past 3 months talking about the bond market than I have in the prior. It's a good thing we're trying to get you to do moreof that. Yeah, I'm sure, but it's been like this. I mean, it hasn't been a sleepy market, the bond market, but why is there why is there so much attention atthis? So you think about we, we spent, I mean, decade, more than a decade in super low interest rates, and by the way you think about from 2014 to 2022, almost nine years.We were in negative interest rates in Europe, negative interest rates for 9 years. So, I mean you talk about somebody like, wow, can I actually put money in and pay somebody to take it? And they uh and so now, because you got inflation running at 3, 3.5% depending on the measure you you look at, central banks have to keep the rate high, central bank keeps the rate high, and you can create portfolios a 6-7% yield.You know, particularly when you get the equity market and evaluations that it that it is today, and you have, you know, pension funds, endowments foundations say, gosh, get me a 6, give me a 7, and life is good without a lot of volatility. So it's become, it's become a really interesting asset class, but it's also the volatility of inflation has been pre-tariffs. Inflation has been high, it was supposed to come down, and now the future with automation and productivity, maybe inflation comes down again. So,You know, listen, the way we start every investment, we think about the risk-free rate like treasuries are the model that we build everything off of. Once you know the risk-free rate, they say, OK, what will I pay for everything from private credit to private equity, but I need to know the risk-free rate. When the risk-free rate's moving around like crazy, it's like, wow, now how do I figure out my risky? You take me back to my CFA training risk rate. It's like the capital R and the squiggly F and the models. Come on, I'm just a pretty face on camera, man, that's pretty good. Uh that's pretty good. So, you know, I, you know, just looking at the, the debt markets, and I should mention this, I mean, you oversee $2.7 trillion in assets, uh, at BlackRock. Like what's the past few weeks been like for you and how is it, how are you trading and making decisions differently compared to the start of the year? So I will say one thing, it is, uh, it is hard, and I would say sleep is not happening as often as uh, no, and I, but it's been intense.But I will say one thing about it that's been, I mean, I, you know, this is a fun market and so when news flow comes at you like this,You know, one of the things that I found is I is when you get markets tend to overreact to things, and, and I find also I think we talked about on your show once, they overreact in Europe more than any time and then there's a period in the morning that they tend to overreact and markets like to go at the theme of the day, but oftentimes with some of this news.All of a sudden you get a piece of news and then it changes the next day and it reverts back the next day. And so if you're in the markets, you know, quite frankly, going the opposite, um, many days, it presents a real opportunity. And, and, you know, people have got nervous about credit and you get nervous about different asset classes. So it's been a good environment to be active in and to be to be dynamic around, but I will say,You can't be confident. And, and so what, you know, one of the things we do around it is when you get periods like this, you, you, you make, you, you, you know, I do a lot of relative value decisions a lot of times, because your conviction just can't be that high because the news flow is so dynamic and so, and, and by the way, based on things that are way out of your control, you know, you can make a decision.You think about where's the economy going and where's, usually it's pretty stable, and then you're making decisions around the margin. These are some pretty radical shifts. So, and it, but, but it's presented some real opportunity, and that's made it fun. As someone that oversees $2.7 trillion in assets, when do you wake up? When do you, when are you first checkingoverseas markets? So I get, so by the way, somebody was laughing at me today because they sent me this long email, very long email at 4:30 in the morning, and I responded immediately.And after reading it, and, uh, I said, what are you doing? And so I get, I get up, listen, I like what I do when I get up at 3:45 in the morning and, and I usually get up without an alarm clock because, you know, I don't know whether subconsciously I know, yeah, yeah, you just are you yeah yeah every day. Do you know I want they once did a test. They use, they use, uh, you know, these systems, you know, all these wearables now that test your stress. I swear they told me they said, you know when your stress peaks, and I said, no, they said 11:30 at night.I said, really? And they say, you know, when your stress level comes down, I said, when they said 3:45 in the morning. They said, why do you think that is? I said, No way is when I have to put my phone down, you're not in control anymore because when my phone, when my phone's on, I could see the markets. It's a weird thing. Like, how could your stress peak at 11:30 and at 11:30 and you feel calm,you see the markets waking up but it is a, yeah, but it is a like all of a sudden now I know and if you want to do something or you need to do something.But anyway, it's, it is, um, you know, I get up because I, you know, I find it intriguing. And, you know, every day, think about what's happening now. Rates are moving, equities are moving, gold's moving, Bitcoin's moving, like the interplay of all these asset classes, something going on at all times, which makes it, makes it more fun. That being said, I do value my weekends because I will say you wake up Saturday morning like, oh my God, thank God, I get a day. Where 10 years not rising towards 5% on Saturday. Yeah, totally, although Bitcoin seems to move around, right? So where, I mean, there's been an outsized focus on the 10 year and it's climbed towards 5%, and I'll get to that in a second, but other moves in debt markets that have caught your attention I believe. So there's a big movement in the steepening of the yield curve and, and, you know, one of the things that I was looking at this morning is pretty remarkable. So if you bought at the end of 2020.And people think about, I buy the 30 years as a hedge or buy 30-year treasuries, you know, if you bought at the end of 20, the value of your investment in the 30 year would be worth 64 cents today. Think about that. It, and by the way, the flip side, if you bought equities at the end of 2020, you'd be the S&P 500, you'd have $165 off of $100. So you, so, so when people think about hedging and I think about what is a long bond doing for me, what are treasury doing for me? Not a lot.And so it's, that is an incredibly different paradigm than any anything we've been uh we've been used to before. So and then the steepening of the yield curve, so, by the way, the front end of the curve's done quite well. And so the steepening curve has been interesting. Also, the interplay between markets internationally, you know, what is Japan, what's happening with Japan, what's happening with their auctions in Japan, what's happening in the UK? So the interplay between different markets and, you know, big one has been the diversification.Of people going into international markets that were, you know, on treasuries and, you know, we've seen reserves in the US that are held in, or sorry, reserves in treasuries held in at other countries.That they've actually declined and they're buying gold and they're buying other, other, uh, international, uh, I'm glad youI'm glad you brought up the international component because I, you know, maybe 34 weeks ago I, I sat down with Treasury Secretary Scott Besson, um, and I asked him, were there any signs of China selling US debt. Now I don't expect Treasury Secretary to tell me on TV, um, yeah, we see that happening. Have you seen that, uh, given.Trade war concerns we have concerns about the US debt position like any red flags in that area because it could have huge ramifications to markets as you know, huge. So traditionally China would use, you know, they'd run this capital account surplus and the money would go into treasuries.They used to hold 1 trillion 350 of treasuries. It's down to 700 billion or so. So there's no question the data is the data in terms of reducing. And by the way, the flip side is gold has been going up on the other side of that in an almost symmetric way. So they're buying gold, correct. And you could see it. I mean, I mean, it's just in an almost symmetric way, reducing treasuries and buying gold. There are certain days where the activity level in treasuries, where treasuries are cheapening, and you tend to see this in the futures market.Where my, I suspect that China is in the market doing something. You don't know. But, but at the end of the at the end of the month or so, you can see what's happened has been pretty clear. China has reduced their manager. My sense is most of what they're doing is letting it roll off. So a lot of their treasury debt just rolls off over time.And my sense is that's most of what's happening. So no sign that they're trying to put pressure on the US via the debt market. It's Hard to say, but, um, the numbers are the numbers in terms of their holdings went down. Now, I think a lot of it, whether, you know, whatever it's around tariffs or what have you, they're funding their domestic, and that's you're seeing that around the world, the countries that used to buy a tremendous amount of treasuries and that was their holdings and reserves. They're now funding their domestic economy, so they have to. And so in buying their own debt. So,I think that is clear in terms of what's happening. Now, whether in certain days they're more active than others, it'd be pretty hard to prove it, but, you know, I watch these futures activity, and oftentimes you can't figure out like where it's coming from.I don't know. Maybe more often than not, I think it that tends to be a place it comes from. Itamazes me that the Moody's downgrade on the US, uh, kind of got swept under the rug. It was, it was important for a day. I, I, we saw it coming, saw it coming. Japan gets a downgrade. Should we be paying more attention to these things and, you know, why, how much of a problem is it longer term if we don't have that AAA credit rating? So, I think the one notch, you know, was not, you know, it it affect the market for 2 or 3 hours. It's, it wasn't so much a functional dynamic because most people are like, where are they gonna go, they go to buy a lot of Finland, like there's not a lot of like, get me a AAA.I said at the end of the day, I think the debt, the size of the debt in the country is the most significant issue we have to watch for everything we do. Certainly in fixed income, but I would argue for other asset classes, we're rolling too much debt. Like, we roll 573 billion a week of debt. That's like rolling Australia every single week. It's too big. It's too big. And by the way, you know, the new, the bill, this new bill will go through. We're not gonna reduce it. I mean, we're not reducing the size of these deficits. So,There's a compounding effect. The other thing that's happening is we're rolling off, so think about for 10 years, we're issuing treasury bills at 0% or 1%. Now we're issuing at 4, 4.25%, 4.5%. So the cost of our debt just keeps going up, and the size of it keeps going up. It's not tenable, and it's not, it's not, it's not sustainable.So I, you know, I think it's something that, and I think Secretary Besson is focused on it. I think we have to focus on we have to get spending down, whether we're gonna get it down, but you know, the big deal is we have to grow faster. The US has to grow. If the cost of the debt in the United States is approaching 4%.We gotta grow faster than that. It's the only way you deal deliver an economy, so we just need to keep growing and, you know, hopefully the US economy is pretty impressive about its ability to grow, and it hasto grow. Hang with us, Rick. We're gonna go off for a quick break. We'll be right back on opening bid.Welcome back to Opening bid. Having a great chat here with Rick Rieder, BlackRock Global Chief Investment Officer of fixed income. Um, we're focusing or we're talking about the US debt position. Given the, the mountain of debt that is likely because of this tax bill, how could the tenure even come down? Are we just looking at a, a slow rise? Like what's the worst case scenario I guess for you? There the worst case scenario is not a slow rise. The worst case scenario is that, is that, listen, if the US tenure moves up, and you know, I I always found for years people said, oh my God, if the tenure gets a 3%, the equity market is going, and then 3.25%, 0 my God, 350 would be and lookat the rally off the liberation liberation, yeah, and so I don't think there's a number because we're in a really different paradigm today that companies don't borrow, or, you know, don't borrow nearly as much as they used to. A lot of tech companies fund themselves through cash flow.Banks or asset liability match. So it's not as important as it was.If it gets there really quickly, that's dangerous. How does it get, how, how does it get there? So, you know, there were a couple, was it 2-3 Fridays ago where people were worried about inflation being higher and you'd have international selling, and, you know, this, and there was, you know, stories about Japan and others would have to sell treasuries. If it got there quickly, that is dislocating for the markets, and that is something that's a real, by the way, two different ways. If Treasury's got their yields got there high or the currency.The dollar went down fast. Either of those becomes really dislocating. Listen, if at the end of the day, dollar comes down moderately, inflation stays reasonably contained, you know, it'll be OK, and the 10 year can move up in yield. You know, by the way, it's not impossible for it come down. I think in the next year or two, you're gonna see a couple of things. One, I think the Fed's gonna cut rates, and I think, by the way, I think the Fed has to.Over the next 6 months a year because we got to bring the cost of the debt down of the country the same point about we gotta grow faster than the cost that'd be a new Fed chair doing that, right? Right. And right. And so, by the way, it's incumbent upon whoever it is. It, it is a big deal, and they said we don't, you know, the Fed chair would say I don't manage the fiscal situation in the country. That being said, it's a big impact. We gotta get that rate down because we gotta outgrow the outgrow the cost. Anyway, that is, that is a big deal. And then the um and the other one is, you know, we just have to have inflation over the next couple of years.I think people underestimate productivity, automation, robotics. I think inflections coming down significantly. By the way, labor replacement, etc. it's a meaning you can have some wage deceleration.I don't know. Like, I think anybody who says, I know what inflation is gonna be beyond the next 6 to 9 months, I think is, is either lying or is arrogant. Like it's just too hard. Well, I'm reminded because we just had uh an episode drop, um, before you were talking to Goldman's chief information officer, Marco Argenti, and he says we're gonna be managing a workforce of AI agents, which isWow, but that's productivity in realtime, and I, I'm pretty blown away. I mean we use AI in some of our, you know, how we look at research, how we look at, um, you know, different functions we used to, we used to perform stress testing, scenario analysis looking at different permutation.I don't know, like it blows me away what it can do and so.I just think it's the people to not say that it's gonna haveA negative effect on inflation, I bring inflation down. I, I think it's gonna be dramatic. Some folks that I've talked to, um, in the bond markets have told me this is gonna be a challenging summer. Uh, we will yields will continue to rise. We'll have tariffs still in place. Are you, are you on board with that? for markets overall, I guess we're looking at like a convergence of like bad things. So, oh well, there's one thing I will say about about the summer.Summer is a time for not a lot of liquidity, and it tends to do some weird things in uh during the summer. Um, you know, you know, there's a lot of counterbalances to it, so I, you know, I don't, I can't really say that's right.I think, you know, we've got hopefully we're getting some better inflation data that comes through, that could be helpful. The big one is, you know, versus seasonals.If we get to what the tariffs, if we, if we just get the news out, and between now and whether it's June 30th or July or July 9th, or I forget the exact date.I just want to know what the news is, because the US economy ends up being very durable, and we can withstand if it's 15% effective tariff, US economy will be just fine. I think people have been impressed. I've been impressed with everybody calls for a recession, and then you see this US economy does does pretty well. We just need to get the news out. And as long as we, we, we find out what is the tariff on China, what is the tariff on Europe.As long as we get that news out, markets can breathe a sigh of relief. People are sitting in an immense amount of cash. Part of why I think these markets like the equity market goes up, they are so much cash, and people just sit on their hands and they're waiting for the news to be out. Are you surprised by the rally of the liberation Los? The size of it, yes. The, um, listen, you get pretty comfortable with, you know, the because I'm a believer US economy is much more durable than people give credit to service economy, technology oriented.But I have to say that if you said to me, gosh, we're gonna get the valuations with a multiple off of.Let's take the last 12 months earnings. You're trading in 24 times multiple off of next year now, and I think some earnings estimates will come up with it. You're still at 21 times. If you said to me, we're gonna have 21 times with an economy that's probably moderating and uncertainty around tariffs, that's been impressive. There's, uh, analysts are still expecting for earnings about to be double digits in the back half of the year. I, I don't buy it. I don't see it. I mean, I talked to a lot of companies and they're calling out, at least to me, third quarter is when the SHI, you know, star.Uh, hits the fan, but that, that's the first quarter of the tower, so does the market trade-off in front of it. So, by the way, it's been impressive. This last, you know, the first quarter data that's come through has been impressive. US economy has been on a pretty good tear.Second quarter, you have to believe you're gonna start to see, you know, including shipments that were made, including capex that was held back, companies just being conservative, the consumer was a bit conservative. Yeah, I think you'll see some of the data. You know, I've said, I've said many times, I don't think we're going into recession, or I think it's unclear. I think you'll see a divot of growth for a month or two, that is good, that could be significant. And then I think we'll work our way through it. So,Listen, I, I, you know, I was looking at some of these earnings estimates that have, you know, some have come down, now they're getting revised back up. Even if you take the earnings estimates, I, I think double digit earnings seems aggressive to me, but if you said single or high, mid to high single digits,The multiple inequities is still pretty full. I will say, you know, I've run big equity portfolios. I'm still running a moderate long because I just look at the cash. She's still bullish long, still bull stocks. Yes, yeah, but, uh, but yeah, I will say and certainly in the last couple of weeks or so, we've bought some downside protection at these valuations because volatility's come down so much. The cost of hedging it has really come down. So we're we're comfortable running.A moderate long, it's not nearly as long as we were, say, last year, what have you, but you can buy some protection. You know, I don't buy long treasuries as a hedge. I think it's crazy, um, but I bought some protection, but we can run a moderate long and it's just every time I stare at the cash, and if there's no news, the market goes up. It doesn't need good news, it just needs no news, and the market, uh, market goes up. So I don't know, it's, you know, you're pushing valuations that give me some agita, but um,But I don't know, like cash gives you some comfort. I wanna get your hot take, uh, in the last minute half of the show. What's the best play in fixed income for the average investor right now? Income that isn't fixed. Like I, I, I mean, I, I think, listen, we're creating portfolios and we run this ETF called Bank and, and, you know, building, we're almost 7% with what is a high, you know, well into investment rate, high triple B rated with a 3 year interest rate, 3-year duration, interest rate sensitivity.Income, income, income. Like I think, you know, I was looking at those numbers I said earlier, if you held a 30-year treasury or 30 year long treasuries, you have, you're worth your $100 or $64. But what happens is income just keeps working, keeps compounding, and you don't have to go way out the yield curve and take the volatility. You're pointing out the 10 years, it's like, why don't I, I don't really need it. Like somebody else can have that thrill, certainly not the 30 year, but if I'm buying 34 year assets and I know the Fed's gonna cut over the next 6 months to a year.Like that income really, really works for you. And by the way, it doesn't have to be in funds we run or or in, you know, there's other ways to get preferred stocks. There's other ways to get income in a portfolio, a time where valuations that are high, like, boy, if you can clip 67 and do different, that that that works. You know you were one of the stars of our conference last fall. I'm just listening to you. I knowwhy you got great feedback. I don't know about, but, uh, it was a, it's a cool conference.

        "header": "40 Billion Reasons to Buy Oracle and Nvidia Stock Like There's No Tomorrow",
        "content": "For the last few years, many of the talking points around artificial intelligence (AI) have touched on topics such as how the technology will bring new levels of efficiency to corporate work environments or how chatbots could answer queries about virtually anything in the blink of an eye. But over the last few months, a new thread in the AI narrative has started to emerge. Infrastructure projects are coming into sharper focus as cloud hyperscalers double down on their commitments to build data centers and buy high-performance chipsets. One of these isthe Stargate Project:Between now and 2029,Oracle(ORCL1.56%),Nvidia(NVDA-1.44%), andOpenAIsay they will invest a total of $500 billion into data centers and other digital infrastructure in the U.S. It's a plan that should have investors quite excited. Let's break down the details of the news surrounding this AI consortium, and assess why Oracle and Nvidia look like tempting buys right now. Oracle's business includes a number of cloud-based software and infrastructure solutions. Throughout the AI revolution, it has acted swiftly, acquiring graphics processing units (GPUs) from the likes of Nvidia andAdvanced Micro Devices, which it has used to build training clusters for its data centers that it can lease to customers. Oracle calls thisinfrastructure-as-a-service(IaaS), and it's currently the fastest-growing segment of its business -- growing by 49% year over year. With that said, Oracle's IaaS offering is still scaling -- it generated only $9.3 billion in sales over the last four reported quarters. For reference, that was less than 20% of Oracle's total revenue base. Nevertheless, I think Oracle's infrastructure services are poised for significant growth. According to recent reporting, Oracle is eyeing 400,000 of Nvidia's GB200 chips -- an order that industry experts estimate could be worth $40 billion. Per the structure of the deal, Oracle plans to lease these GPUs to OpenAI. The way I think about this partnership is that Oracle is now in a position to multiply the size of its IaaS business by several times, suggesting it could scale up to be worth tens of billions of dollars annually in the coming years. Image source: Getty Images. I see a couple of reasons why this Stargate deal is meaningful for Nvidia. First, Nvidia's revenue is highly concentrated -- just two customers accounted for 30% of its sales during the first quarter. Although Nvidia does not explicitly indicate which of its customers are its largest, nor say how much they spend, many analysts on Wall Street have concluded thatMeta Platforms,Amazon,Microsoft, andAlphabetare among its biggest buyers. On the surface, this might look like a problem, as all of these cloud hyperscalers are developing their own custom silicon solutions. As they complement existing Nvidia-based architectures with their own chips, that could lead to a revenue headwind for Nvidia down the road. However, other customers such as Oracle andElon Musk's xAIare fast emerging as major buyers for Nvidia's chips. This suggests that demand for the company's hardware will remain robust, despite the emergence of rival chips. In addition, it is important to understand that the Stargate Project is a multiyear initiative. In fact, OpenAI is reportedly considering opening a host of data centers across the country, with its initial build-out with Oracle representing the first phase of that longer-term plan. Combine all that with the fact that large playersin the Middle Eastare showing rising interest in building massive new data centers of their own -- powered by Nvidia chips -- and Nvidia looks poised to benefit greatly from AI-related capital expenditures for years to come. A glance at theforward price-to-earnings(P/E) multiples for both Oracle and Nvidia might lead you to believe both stocks have gotten expensive. After all, the average forward P/E across theS&P 500index is about 21.  ORCL PE Ratio (Forward)data byYCharts. With that said, it's hard to overlook the valuation compression that Oracle and Nvidia have experienced over the last couple of months amid President Donald Trump's tariff and trade war turmoil. Both companies' shares have witnessed nominal rebounds of late. However, each stock trades at a discount to its historical forward P/E level. In my view, investors have a great opportunity now to pick up share of both Nvidia and Oracle, as the Stargate Project is still in an early stage, and production of Blackwell chips has yet to fully scale. I think Oracle is taking the right steps to supercharge its long-term growth -- I expect that infrastructure services will be the offerings thatturn it into a trillion-dollar business. Regarding Nvidia, I see theStargate Project as a long-run catalystand would consider scooping up shares now, as more big deals will likely come to fruition over time.",

        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA,Financials)is preparing to reenterChina's AI data center market with a custom B40 processor, Shenzhen-based ZJK Industrial said Thursday. ZJK plans to begin mass production of the B40 chip as early as this month, aiming to meet growing demand for Nvidia's B40 project, according to a company news release. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. The B40 accelerator is based on Nvidia's Blackwell architecture and targets mid- to high-end Chinese customers. Nvidia has been unable to ship AI data center products to China since the U.S. government barred its H20 processor in early April. We are still evaluating our limited options. Until we settle on a new product design and receive approval from the U.S. government, we are effectively foreclosed from China's $50 billion data center market, an Nvidia spokesperson said. On Thursday, Nvidia shares fell 1.4 percent to $139.99 in New York trading. Meanwhile, ZJK Industrial stock jumped 12 percent to close at 5.40 in Shenzhen. ZJK, which supplies precision components for electronic and AI systems, said that B40 shipments could exceed one million units by year-end, complementing Nvidia's global RTX Pro 6000 workstation graphics cards. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang told analysts on a May 28 conference call that the company is exploring options to serve Chinese customers again. If the B40 design receives U.S. approval, Nvidia could regain access to China's lucrative data center market. For now, Chinese partners such as ZJK are taking the lead in adapting Nvidia's architecture to local regulations and demand. This article first appeared onGuruFocus.",

        "header": "Prediction: This \"Magnificent Seven\" Growth Stock Will Hit an All-Time in June. Here's Why It's Worth Buying Now.",
        "content": "Microsoft(MSFT0.48%)stock has been on a tear ever since the tech giant reported its fiscal 2025 third-quarter earnings on April 30. The stock soared by 16.5% in May and is now just a few percentage points below its all-time high. Despite that run-up, there are plenty of reasons to believe that thisgrowth stockis still a good value for long-term investors. Image source: Getty Images. Microsoft has made a monster comeback in 2025, even relative to other\"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. That group of megacap tech-focused companies has led the major stock market indexes -- including theS&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC)andNasdaq Composite(NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC)-- to new heights in recent years.  METAdata byYCharts. What separates Microsoft from other growth stocks is its business model. Microsoft hasthree segments. The smallest -- which it calls \"more personal computing\" -- is also its slowest growing and has the lowest margins. But it is still a highly profitable segment -- consisting of Windows, devices, gaming through Xbox, and more. The other two segments are fast growing and produce ultra-high margins. \"Productivity and business processes\" consists of the Microsoft 365 suite of products and cloud services, which include the artificial intelligence (AI) assistant Microsoft 365 Copilot. Microsoft has done an excellent job growing this segment with newer software through Microsoft Teams, the expansion of SharePoint, and the improvement of existing software using AI tools. Its \"intelligent cloud\" segment includes server products and cloud services -- led by Azure, as well as GitHub cloud services and enterprise solutions. Microsoft is the undisputed No. 2 player in cloud computing behindAmazonWeb Services (AWS), butAzure has been gaining market share. The days of Microsoft being a slow and stodgy legacy hardware and software business are long gone. The Microsoft of today is a coiled spring for capitalizing on massive investments in productivity growth, whether that's through AI-powered solutions, cloud, or enterprise solutions. It also benefits from incredibly high pricing power because it has established solutions that are popular among individual users, students, and businesses -- giving it a captive audience to which it can upsell new AI tools. The adoption of Microsoft 365 Copilots, GitHub Copilot, and Azure AI solutions continues to grow. Microsoft has arguably the most stable business model of the Magnificent Seven without compromising on upside potential in key trends like cloud computing and AI. Consider its six megacap peers: Amazon is heavily dependent on AWS for its long-term growth. Applestill makes most of its money on products, led by the iPhone. Though it does have a high-margin service segment, itsoverall growth has been slowing. Nvidia's growth has mainly come from sales of graphics processing units for AI and high-performance computing. Its concentration in this high-margin industry has taken Nvidia to new heights, but has also made it more of apure-play AI companythan it was in the past. Alphabetstillmakes the bulk of its revenue from Google Search. Instagram is ahigh-powered growth engineforMeta Platforms, but its success has made Meta less diversified than it used to be. Teslahas potentialto grow through autonomous vehicles, a robotaxi service, robotics, and renewable energy. But for now, it remains primarily a car company. This isn't to say that the other Magnificent Seven stocks aren't compelling buys now (in fact, I think Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms all stand out as good buys). Rather, the takeaway is that Microsoft has arguably the best business model in terms of diversification. It's capitalizing on multiple growth trends, and isn't overly reliant on one product or service. Having a great business model means little if it is built on top of a shaky financial foundation. But Microsoft happens to have an ultra-elite balance sheet. It sports perfect corporate credit ratings from top agenciesS&P Global(AAA) andMoody's(Aaa). Those high ratings are based on the strength of Microsoft's business and the fact that its capital structure doesn't depend on debt. Indeed,Microsoft exited the most recent quarterwith roughly twice as much in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments on its books as long-term debt. Its excellent business model and strong balance sheet mean the company doesn't have big interest expenses, which can eat away at profits and leave less cash flow to return to shareholders. Because it can fund its operations and long-term growth plans with cash from the business, it can pass along a considerable amount of capital to shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends. Microsoft not onlydistributes more total dividends than any other U.S. company, but it also has the highest dividend yield of the Magnificent Seven. Granted, that's just 0.7% at the current share price. However, its total capital return program is much more appealing when one considers its15 consecutive years of dividend raisesand its share buybacks. Microsoft is a buy because it is an ultra-high-quality company that investors can count on even during times of uncertainty. It can continue investing in long-term growth because of its diversified, high-margin business segments and rock-solid balance sheet. Investors can also count on the company to consistently repurchase stock and grow the dividend. The only drawback is its valuation. Microsoft sports a 35.6price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio-- which is a good bit higher than the S&P 500's average P/E ratio of 28.2 but not too far above Microsoft's 10-year median ratio of 32.7. The good news is that Microsoft has steadily been growing earnings at around 10% per year -- and there's no reason to believe that growth rate will change anytime soon. So it should be able to grow into its current valuation over time. Add it all up, and Microsoft stands out as a well-rounded buy in June for investors willing to pay a premium price for a quality company.",

        "content": "Shares of Lululemon Athletica (LULU) sank 20% in premarket trading Friday after the apparel maker's second-quarter outlook came in below estimates, and the company also cut its full-year profit forecast. Lululemon projects second-quarter revenue of $2.54 billion to $2.56 billion and earnings per share from $2.85 to $2.90, each below the analyst consensus compiled by Visible Alpha of $2.57 billion and $3.28. The athletic apparel brand still expects $11.15 billion to $11.30 billion in full-year sales, but lowered its EPS forecast to a range of $14.58 to $14.78, down from $14.95 to $15.15 previously. Responding to the lowered profit expectation, analysts from JPMorgan and UBS each lowered their price targets for the stock to $303 and $290, respectively, from $389 and $330. CEO Calvin McDonald said customers have \"responded well to the product innovations\" the company has introduced, as it looks to fix the \"newness problem\" it has described previously. However, McDonald said in Lululemon's earnings call that U.S. consumers \"remain cautious right now, and they are being very intentional about their buying decisions,\" per an AlphaSense transcript. \"We are planning to take strategic price increases, looking item by item across our assortment as we typically do, and it will be price increases on a small portion of our assortment, and they will be modest in nature,\" CFO Meghan Frank said regarding Lululemon's plans for mitigating the impact of tariffs. She added that the company is also planning to make some changes to its supply chain that will have more of an impact on the second half of the year. First-quarter top- and bottom-line results came in as analysts expected at $2.37 billion in sales and $2.60 EPS, but comparable sales growth of 1% fell well short of the 4.56% growth that analysts had expected. Entering the day, Lululemon shares were down about 14% since the start of the year.",

        "header": "Undervalued and Profitable: 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks for Buffett-Minded Investors",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) could be the biggest growth opportunity for investors this century. According to a projection by United Nations Trade and Development, the AI market could grow from $189 billion in 2023 to $4.8 trillion by 2033. Fortunes will be made during this growth sprint, and finding the bestAI stocksto invest in now could give your portfolio a huge leg up. But what about those who follow the philosophy of legendary value investors like Warren Buffett? Right now, there are two AI stocks that even Buffett-minded investors will love. In fact,Berkshire Hathawayalready has a position worth more than $2 billion in one of the well-known businesses discussed below. Nearly every investor who follows the AI space will be well aware ofNvidia(NVDA-1.44%). Right now, with a market cap of more than $3 trillion, it's one of the three largest companies in the world. It designs and sells a variety of types of computer chips and software, but it's best known for its high-end graphics processing units, or GPUs. These specialized parallel processors can provide precisely the sort of computing power necessary to train and power machine learning and artificial intelligence models. Because it was already dominating the GPU space when the AI trend took off, Nvidia now has a roughly 90% market share in GPUs destined for AI applications -- a lead that has put it at the center of the AI revolution. As you might expect, Nvidia's sales have grown tremendously in recent years thanks to escalating demand for AI software, which has thus escalated demand for the GPUs that allow the technology to function at scale. Over the past three years alone, Nvidia's revenue has jumped by a total of 450%. And if analysts' forecasts are any indication, its sales could continue to grow at double-digit percentage rates annually for the next decade and beyond. Accordingly, Nvidia's price-to-sales multiple is a lofty 22.9. But because the company boasts one of the highest gross margins in the industry, the shares also trade at just 44 times earnings. That is a premium valuation, but given the rapid growth expected, shares trade at just 32 times forward earnings. Again, that's still fairly expensive -- but it's not as expensive as you might think a dominant AI leader with a bright future would be. An oft-repeated Buffett quote is that \"It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price,\" and he frequently advises that people should invest in quality businesses for the long term. Based on Nvidia's competitive advantages and high profitability, it's still trading at a fair price. The upfront premium should quickly come to look like a steal for investors who are willing to hang on to the stock for many years. Image source: Getty Images. Want to invest in an AI stock that's already in the portfolio of Buffett-run\u00a0Berkshire Hathaway? There is one, but many investors may not recognize it as an artificial intelligence giant:Amazon(AMZN0.26%). Most people think of Amazon as an e-commerce business. That segment still produces most of its revenue. But in terms of operating profit, the biggest contributor is actually Amazon Web Services, more commonly referred to simply as AWS. It's the largest cloud infrastructure provider in the world. With a market share of about 30%, it controls nearly as much as the next two competitors combined. AWS and its cloud computing peers are some of the biggest buyers of GPUs. Rather than building out expense infrastructure themselves, most AI companies rely on cloud computing services to help them scale up their infrastructure on demand. So if Nvidia is at the center of the AI revolution, so is AWS, and thus Amazon. Berkshire Hathaway opened its stake in Amazon back in 2019. Today, its position is worth just over $2 billion, and it made no changes in the position last quarter, even with shares at record prices. While its e-commerce business is typically in the spotlight, the company's AWS segment makes it a strong, though slightly diluted, AI pick for investors.",

        "content": "Tariff-related disruptions weren't serious enough to drag the job market into distress, at least not in May.U.S. employers added 139,000 jobs in May, down from 147,000 in April, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said Friday.That was more than the 125,000 forecasters had expected, according to a survey of economists byDow Jones NewswiresandThe Wall Street Journal.The unemployment rate stayed at 4.2%, the same as in April, remaining in the 4%-4.2% range it's stayed since May 2024.The data showed employers have remained reluctant to lay off workers, even as hiring has slowed significantly from its breakneck pace of the post-pandemic years. Labor expertsexpect the job market to start to show cracksin the coming months as uncertainty about tariffs has made companies more reluctant to hire workers, according to recent surveys. But the job market has stayed afloat so far. \"Stronger than expected jobs growth and stable unemployment underlines the resilience of the U.S. labor market in the face of recent shocks,\" Lindsay Rosner, head of Multi-Sector Fixed Income Investing at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, wrote in a commentary. Stock futures jumped in the minutes after the report was released Friday morning. Investors had been nervous about the jobs report on Thursday, afterreports on private payrollsandlayoffsfueled fears that tariffs were already affecting the labor market. Friday's official government report was a relief, said Adam Hetts, Global Head of Multi-Asset at Janus Henderson Investors. \"Good news is good news today, although tariff uncertainty remains, making subsequent hard data releases over the summer extremely important for clarity on the post-Liberation Dayeconomy,\" Hetts wrote. The lack of red flags about employment could encourage officials at the Federal Reserve to maintain theirpatient approach to rate cuts. Policymakers at the Fed have held the central bank's benchmark interest rate at a higher-than-usual level this year to keep borrowing costs on all kinds of loans elevated and smother inflation. The Fed is mandated to keep inflation low and employment high, and could lower interest rates to boost the economy if the job market starts to falter. Fed Chair Jerome Powell and other members of the Fed's policy committee have said they are waiting to see whetherPresident Donald Trump's trade warswill boost inflation, cause a wave of unemployment, or both. So far, they have done neither, and the solid job market data could give them breathing room to stay on the fence for longer.\"With the Fed laser-focused on managing the risks to the inflation side of its mandate, today\u2019s stronger-than-expected jobs report will do little to alter its patient approach,\" Rosner wrote. \"We expect the Fed to remain on hold at this month\u2019s meeting and think a softening in the labor market data is likely required for the Fed to continue its easing cycle.\u201d",

        "content": "Investors have followedMichael Burry'strades ever since he predicted the financial crisis of 2008 and profited from it by taking up short positions. The man still known to many as \"The Big Short\" investor is making headlines for his bearish outlook on one of the world's biggest tech stocks. Benzinga examines why Burry has taken short positions on Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Nvidiashares have spent much of the last 18 months on a bull run powered by AI's emergence as the world's hottest investment sector. As recently as May 2023, Nvidia shares were trading in the $35 range. Then it became clear that Nvidia's graphics processors and chipsets were mission-critical components in AI development, and the company's stock was off to the races. Don't Miss: Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing \u2014this is your last chance to become an investor for $0.80 per share. Invest where it hurts \u2014 and help millions heal:Invest in Cytonics and help disrupt a $390B Big Pharma stronghold. Nvidia shares increased from around $40 in January 2024 to $147.16 by early November. The company's market cap grew to an astonishing $3 trillion, and CEOJensen Huangachieved near celebrity status as his company gate-crashed the S&P 500 Magnificent Seven. That kind of explosion in share price and market cap made Nvidia one of the biggest stories of 2024, but Burry knows what goes up must come down. Barchartis reporting that Burry's Scion Asset Management has numerous put options in Nvidia. Beyond that, the water gets a little murky in terms of predicting Burry's long game. Barchart compiled the option data from Scion's March 13F filings, but those filings include multiple shorts. Scion is also betting against Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), Baidu, and Tripadvisor.com (NASDAQ:TRIP). The filings only note that the combined total of Scion's shorts is $199 million. Trending: Maximize saving for your retirement and cut down on taxes:Schedule your free call with a financial advisor to start your financial journey \u2013 no cost, no obligation. There is no information about expiration dates or strike prices, and the filings don't disclose whether Scion has long positions on Nvidia or the other stocks it's shorting. All this makes it difficult to decipher whether Burry has completely soured on Nvidia. PresidentDonald Trump'stariffs have rattled multiple economic sectors, especially tech and retail, where Nvidia andAlibabaoperate. Like many tech companies, Nvidia is heavily dependent on Chinese components, and jitters over the tariffs saw its shares slump to the $90 range in late March. Trump is still negotiating with China, and Nvidia has rebounded to $135.50 per share. The next shoe to drop will be quarterly earnings, which Burry may be expecting to fall short of projections. See Also:Be part of the next med-tech breakthrough for only $350 \u2014 500+ surgeries already done with nView's AI system. So, the pressing question for investors is whether Burry is simply hedging with these short bets or believes Nvidia is overpriced and due for a correction. He has a proven knack for getting out of high-performing positions before the bottom drops, and these shorts could be part of that trend. However, the fact that Burry and Scion have $199 million in shorts spread across multiple positions may indicate that Burry is guarding against the downside. With that said, Burry shorting Nvidia should give investors cause to assess their long-term positions and goals with this stock. In the meantime, keep your eyes peeled for Nvidia's earnings report and news on the tariff negotiations. Both of those will have a significant impact on Burry's next moves with Nvidia.

        "content": "June 6 -Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) is poised to gain as NVIDIA's (NASDAQ:NVDA) Blackwell GPU rollout accelerates. Analysts point to a $20 billionpartnershipwith Saudi data center firm DataVolt and upbeat upgrades as key drivers. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with SMCI. Last week, NVIDIA reported that Blackwell chips now account for about 70% of its data center revenue, with sales roughly doubling quarter over quarter. These GPUs power cutting-edge AI workloads, and Super Micro's server designs are built to match that demand. SMCI's modular systems feature advanced cooling and power management, making them an ideal match for Blackwell's dense computing requirements. The companies collaborate closely on software integration, ensuring SMCI servers support the latest NVIDIA architectures from day one. Additionally, SMCI's partnership with Saudi data center operator DataVolt, valued at $20 billion, underscores its role in supplying high-density GPU servers. As Blackwell deployments spread across hyperscale facilities, SMCI stands to benefit from strong demand for customizable, high-performance infrastructure. While SMCI's profit margins remain tighter than some peers, its agility in aligning with NVIDIA's AI roadmap helps drive growth. Investors monitoring AI hardware trends view SMCI as a key beneficiary of NVIDIA's expanding GPU ecosystem. Based on the one year price targets offered by 15 analysts, the average target price for Super Micro Computer Inc is $40.00 with a high estimate of $70.00 and a low estimate of $15.00. The average target implies a downside of -1.90% from the current price of $40.77. Based on GuruFocus estimates, the estimated GF Value for Super Micro Computer Inc in one year is $68.35, suggesting a upside of +67.65% from the current price of $40.77.

The strength in discrete GPUs contrasts with a broader slowdown in the desktop CPU market, which shrank by 14.5% year over year and 20.6% quarter over quarter. However, data center GPU shipments rose 9.6%, reflecting ongoing AI-driven demand. The discrete GPU market is expected to face a -10.3% CAGR through 2028, with Jon Peddie Research projecting an installed base of 130 million units by the end of the forecast period. By 2028, PC GPUs are expected to total 2.8 billion units, with dedicated GPUs reaching 15% penetration. This article first appeared onGuruFocus.",

This podcast was recorded on June 02, 2025. Andy Cross:Stocks rocket higher in May. You're listening to Motley Fool Money. Welcome to Motley Fool Money. I'm Andy Cross, joined here by fellowStock Advisoranalyst and advisor Asit Sharma. Thanks for being here, Asit. Asit Sharma:Andy, great to be here with you. Andy Cross:Well, today on the show, we're catching up with earnings from Zscaler and Ulta Beauty. But we start with US stocks posting their best month since late 2023 Asit.The S&Prose 6% in May and is now within 4% of its all time February high. TheNasdaqis up more than 25% from those April lows. It's like investors have shaken off the tariff and growth worries, Asit, we just had a month ago. I think the question is, what should investors do now? Asit Sharma:Andy, I think investors should balance their risk appetite with some realism here. The number of companies that were able to confidently project out their outlook for the next quarter or even 2025, I felt like I could count them on one hand this quarter. The market's gotten really used to these wild swings of panic from, this is going to be the worst potential trade outcomes to euphoria over, maybe this is the not so worst outcome. That's not a stable state for investing. I think investors, from my perspective, they should keep investing but be rational here. Don't assume that favorable conditions for stock outperformance are in place, because, they simply aren't yet. What are you seeing? Andy Cross:I think the market, it was at 22 times earnings, and it dropped down to about 18 times during those April lows. Now it's jumped back up to the 22 times earnings. I think caution I did more stock buying in April into May, and I've been a little bit more slowing down that when I look at, just some overall sentiment measurements, offset the American Association of Individual Investors, that sentiment index read almost 42% bearish versus 61.9% bearish back in April. The individual investor has become less bearish over time, and that's actually a little bit of a contrary indicator. We have the same thing on our own website. We talk about the potential growth indicator, which is now at 11.5 versus 14 in April. The lower that goes, the more euphoric your average investor gets because it means that there's more capital tied into stocks relative to cash on the sidelines. That euphoria starts to signal a little bit of caution in my mind. I think, you start to get some investors who look a little bit more euphoric, as opposed to pessimistic. The valuations get a little bit more stressed, and I think stocks get a little bit more richly valued. I think it's time to think about a little bit more selective securities like, the likes of a booking or maybe a progressive, as opposed to going in with really high end growth. What do you think? Asit Sharma:Sometimes it feels like you're taking volatility as a forward indicator, CC, for example, what the fix has done, which is a predictor volatility and adjusting your stock purchases for that. That almost seems very short term in nature, Andy, but I think it's smart in terms of picking up the stocks you want at the prices you want. When the market is getting a little too complacent, that might be time to look at stocks which have those lower trading multiples, vice versa also holds. Andy Cross:I think those ones that are really cash heavy that sell them a little bit more reasonable, even like a company likeMicrosoft, it is so ingrained. Something that looks a little bit more like that, rather than something a little bit more on the speculative side or a little bit more on the higher growth, higher multiple side. I love those businesses, and we do, too, here, Asit and you and I do, but, those don't jump really to the top of my list when we start seeing valuations move up this high, like we've seen over the last month or so. Asit Sharma:I agree. Andy Cross:Let's move on to earnings. Let's start with Zscaler. The Zero Trust Cloud cybersecurity specialist jumped nearly 10% Asit on Friday after reporting really healthy fiscal third quarter earnings that included a third straight quarter of 23% growth in annual recurring revenue. That's really a key metric that we like to track with Zscaler. What caught your attention when you look at the cybersecurity leaders earnings from last week? Asit Sharma:Andy, I also liked that growth in annual recurring revenue or ARR, as it's popularly called. I also liked another acronym, RPO remaining performance obligation. Think of this as revenue backlog. That grew 30% year over year. This is equal at five billion bucks to almost two years worth of revenue. Now, of course, Zscaler isn't going to stop growing, so this isn't really two years' worth of revenue, but it just shows you the backlog of contractual work the company has built. That stood out to me and also the role AI is playing in revenue composition. I think this proves out something that many of us suspect, but we don't get a chance to see it a lot in action, which is a strong company that's a little boring can stay stronger for a lot longer than you'll pay attention. I feel like people have forgotten about Zscaler in some ways, with the emergence of companies likeCrowdStrike, the resurgence of a business likeFortinet.These seem to be much more in the conversation these days in the cybersecurity place. But here we have Zscaler, which has created highly effective AI agents, for one thing, to help companies deal with security operations tasks. It comes to mind that the business which was built around this zero trust architecture really played well and plays well in an age of AI threats. Now, you could call that dumb luck, and maybe to some extent, it is. But it also reminds me of strong companies, Andy, likeNVIDIA, which have leading tech that prove themselves worthy of the next use cases. Now, we can say with NVIDIA, they create those new use cases. But I really like that just reading through the call, looking at these numbers today, the strength and ongoing business is underpinned by AI demand. Andy Cross:It's interesting. Dumb luck, maybe, but also right place right time. Jay Chaudhry who's the founder, the CEO, major shareholder in the business continues to drive it forward. I really like what I saw from some of the new initiatives when they think about that zero trust branch they have, which expands outside, like, core operating and then saw some really impressive performance from that product. Also, you mentioned the AI initiative. Their sales progress. They introduced something this year called Z-Flex, which is a little bit more Asit of a usage based pricing mechanism and trying to push more and more clients to encourage using and signing up for this. They've seen some real benefit from that initiative, too. They hired a new sales director Mike Rich, who came over from service now, and so, which also has some consumption based usage systems and pricing mechanisms in their own products. I like how they're innovating both on the product side. But really driving this sales side and I like that and they talk a lot about how that ongoing ARR, that annual recurring revenue metric is going to be more important as they continue to build out the modules, and then their clients have this consumption based pricing method to be able to add or take off different modules as they see fit based on what they need. I like what we're seeing there, and I also like the fact that they boosted guidance a little bit. Revenues, they expect to be up 23% for this fiscal year. Now it's their fiscal fourth quarter coming up, so 23% versus 22% in the prior period. Their operating margin, they increase that a little bit, too, and then they're adjusted EPS. The one thing to watch, I think, is $1 based retention rate fell a little bit this quarter, and they are talking about these innovations and the cost of those innovations, Asit and going to market. That costs money to do that, and they're willing to take a little bit of the margin hit to go into that. But I like the fact that they continue to innovate on both the product side, as well as the sales side. Asit Sharma:You're right, Andy. Jay Chaudhry is someone who pushes on a lot of fronts, and that's what you want in a CEO. On this new consumption based model, the flex model, it's interesting, we saw a couple of years after the pandemic, when interest rates spike so many companies that we admire in the software as a service world, testing out these consumption models saying, if you guys don't want to pay us upfront for years at a time, we get that. Everyone's trying to control costs, so we'll have a little bit of pay as you go. Now, this flex program is consumption based a little bit, but it also brings in this other concept, which I think is very powerful for a company like Zscaler. Traditionally, Zscaler sign up companies for years on specific modules. If you wanted to change anything, Andy, you had to go through a new procurement process filled with negotiations. Andy Cross:Very complex. Asit Sharma:Nobody wanted to do that, it's complex. That's not a lose lose, but it's not a win win either. It's like, we'll just take a pass. A company couldn't get the products it wanted when things evolved, neither could Zscaler get the revenue. But here we have, and I think this is because things are moving so fast with AI, the ability of a company to say, look we signed up for these modules, but if you can give us the same pricing, we want to switch out some. Let's take this new, for example, random example out at the top of my head, this AI prompt injection threat protection. We want that module. Under this new plan, you can do that. The uptake the Flex program, although it's small has been pretty quick. Then, lastly, just to circle back on the cost structure, I agree with you. This is a company that if it wanted to, could be turning a GAAP profit right now. They tend to work at break even GAAP margins to slight losses, and it's not because the company's not growing. You mentioned that 23% growth right at the top as a headline number in the ARR, Andy. But here we've got, again, Jay Chaudhry and his team not afraid to spend on R&D, to bump that expense up to keep evolving with AI, not afraid to invest in the direct salesforce team. I will say, I'm excited that you brought up the fact that their sales force is being directed by someone who comes over from service now, which I've often said, these are the assassins of the enterprise world. They like to aggressively form deep relationships with enterprises and sign great contracts, very hard to dislodge. Jay Chaudhry now is directing his sales force Tia to invest in getting these deeper relationships as they go on. Andy Cross:Let's get down to the stocks at about 275. You got a $42 billion market cap. Now it sells at about 15 times revenue Asit versus about 10 times last fall. A little bit more expensive. What do you think about the stock here? Asit Sharma:I think if you're a holder of this company, you have much more reason to feel confident after the last few quarters than perhaps this time last year. But I'm not so sure I'm a buyer at this point. One thing I have to qualify all this praise of the company with some realism. A dash of realism. The trading multiples feel a little inflated to me. Now, they always do a Zscaler. It is a company that's growth oriented, has great free cash flow margins. I think of 18%, management was talking about exceeding the rule of 50. They call it the rule of 52. But basically, when you add free cash flow growth to revenue growth, if you can get above 40 or 50, these are great benchmarks, and I'm not dragging on those, but just to say, this is historically a company that has been a little volatile visa-v investor sentiment. If you like Zscaler, I'm going to bet that with the macro picture we have for the rest of the year and its historic volatility, you probably can get a better price if you're patient. One thing you've taught me is true, the patient can often get that price they're looking for if they are able to hold out and keep the cash ready. Andy Cross:I think they'll do about $3 billion in that ARR this year. At this multiple, after the performance has been so strong, I think I'm willing to just just sit back. I own it. I'm completely comfortable holding it. Not really eager to jump in, but if I see it pull back, this quarter was very impressive, and I like those initiatives. As Jay said on the call, cyber continues to get a lot of interest. IT budgets are constrained in general, but cybersecurity is one spot where clients are willing to spend, and that's going to benefit Zscaler, I think, for many years ahead. Let's pivot over to retail. Asit Ulta Beauty shot up 12% on Friday after delivering first quarter results that, really showcased its strength in beauty retail. Comps are up 2.9%, driven by 2.3% increase in average ticket size, and 0.6% increase in transactions, Asit. The retailer took market share. What did you see in the earnings that you liked? Asit Sharma:What stood out to me, Andy, is the model here, and I think the strength of Ulta's model has been obscured over the last year or so it's been tough if you're an investor in this world of beauty and cosmetics. But this particular model is very much based in the idea of beauty, the concept of beauty. We can see just from the world writ large, how pervasive social media is on people's understanding of personal aesthetics, their own appreciation of themselves, how they look. I think that Ulta really plays on this. I want to paraphrase something that CEO Kecia Steelman said about the quarter and about recent trend at Ulta. She said that consumer engagement with beauty is healthy because people are willing to trade other stuff, in order to keep buying their beauty products, they're willing to take these trade offs. Here we have beauty not so much of a discretionary item for a certain set of people, but almost as a staple that you are going to continue to buy it. But at the same time, Kecia said that they're very cautious about value, so the company has to bring that value. We'll dial into this a bit more in just a moment here. What did you see out of these results? Andy Cross:Kecia said that many consumers indicate that they are leaning into beauty as comfort and escape from the stress of macro uncertainty. There's been often that long line that investors are focused on Asit that beauty tends to be very resilient. I think we've seen that struggle over the past like you said, past year, 18 months or so. I think there's a lot of expectations that are not very high coming into this quarter, and Ulta exceeded those expectations, and they boosted their guidance a little bit, and the new CEO Kecia Steelman, who I think has a real plan for Ulta. She talked about her Ulta Beauty and Leashed Initiative that is going to drive core growth scale into new business lines, streamline cost structures. I think she set up a really good plan. She talked about how they took some market share gain. They had better member engagement in the in store performance, which is someplace where she's really focusing on, and I think Ulta is excelling. I think that all started to show up. Now, that is costing money, Asit. They are making investments. Their capex is going to grow somewhere between 13 or 15% up to 30% this year. They're going to invest it back in the stores. They're seeing some cost pressure on the employees side. They are making the investments. But I think with the scale they have, it's actually good investment, and ultimately that return on capital is going to be well served for investors. Asit Sharma:I think you're hitting on something that the market picked up on Andy, which is to say, look at the outlook for this company for the rest of the year. It's actually decreasing. I think comparable sales are going to land between 0%-1% for the entire fiscal year. Why did the stock react the way it did? I think it's the taking of market share, but also seeing that the plan for new stores continues, they're going to open 60 stores this year. If you take that divided by the base, rough numbers, this is a company that's growing its store count by 4%-5% a year. I have to be careful here, Andy, because sometimes when I talk fast, people hear 45%. No, 4%-5%. But hey, for retail, that's a pretty steady store count.. If you can put a little bit of comps growth on top of that and manage that bottom line, it becomes a very nice economic model that investors can feel confident about. This is something else that came through during the discussion post earnings. The idea, as Kecia said that, some of this success it's retail 101. It's the basics. She said, it's about being focused and controlling what the company can control in a dynamic which is very, up for whatever the whim of current trade winds are this morning, next week when we wake up. This environment against that, you can control cost. They talked about this, as you just alluded to, the giving up a little bit of margin, putting more people in place during store hours, taking on that load on the payroll, getting inventory in house. Again, if you don't have it in house, you can't sell it and keeping with that store opening cadence, you see a company that's managing its cost structure pretty well, but also making the investments to keep those customers engaged. They've got some 45 million people in their loyalty program. It is a well rounded business, and as some of this dust settles around the whole beauty and cosmetics sector, I think folks will be looking to concentrate capital into just a few high quality names. We likeELF beautyat Stock Advisor, and that's been making a comeback. This is another high quality company, and I think their post earnings results should reflect that vote of confidence. Andy Cross:I spent about 15 bucks in an Ulta just yesterday on some ELF products, so supporting both those companies. We'll get to the stock in a second, Asit. I just didn't want to touch a little bit on the tariff. She mentioned that only about 1% of their merchandise is direct import. The rest is really partnering with their brands. There's some questions about where's the pricing going to fall if tariffs increase? We'll have to see how that all plays. I was impressed just quickly on their strength in the fragrance. The fragrance was one of their leading spots and just new brands, really investing into new brands and bringing new brands and partnering those brands inside the store. They hosted 20,000 in store events this quarter, a lot of them with product partners. Asit Sharma:That's to that engagement that they're so good at. I think for the demographic that they aim, which is younger and younger, those brand endorsements are very important. We're a personality driven consumption culture. Ulta is pretty good at that. I want to go back to one thing, though, and let's ding them here a bit, Andy. Just give a demerit here. I'm not saying it's disingenuous, but I think the risk is a little higher of tariffs than the company presented it. I totally get it. You're featuring brands in your portfolio in your stores. 1% is direct import. But if your brand portfolios have to raise prices because of tariffs, then that's going to affect the folks who walk into the store. I still think they've got a little bit more exposure than they may have discussed. Not that they were trying to hide it. The discussion didn't center enough around, what's the impact if we get on, the cosmetics level I know, 15% higher prices later this year. I don't know if we'll see that much, but to me, that's a risk. Andy Cross:Well, we talked about that with ELF, ELF manufacturing products, and where's the tariff come and who has pricing power? How does that get passed on to the retailer? The one thing about Ulta that I think they have shown very much like other big box retailers is that scale. They did say, we have the ability, we think to be able to navigate those, but proof is going to be in the pudding. Or maybe in the makeup palette as we see how that pricing shakes out. Let's get to the stock , Asit. By the way, I will say they repurchased 986,000 shares at about $363 per share. The stock right now is at 473, so that quarterly investment, at least as of right now, has been good for shareholders. Stocks up 10% this year, flat against the market. Are you buying? Asit Sharma:I would be a buyer here, Andy. I tell you, one of the things that is still apparent is the company is below its historical trading multiples on some fronts. Not by much, but enough that if you've got the long term vision for this company, you understand that real estate cadence. You think that this company can hold its own against some new entrants, like, look at Sephora going into Cole's locations. That's a big competitor that folks talk about. Well, going forward, looking at a company that's trading close to 20 times its next 12 months earnings per share. I feel that it's good. Maybe you're not getting a bargain basement price, especially after being up 10%. This is retail, after all. We were talking about technology earlier growth stocks. This is never going to grow as quickly as a Zscaler. On the other hand. I don't think it's a bad price here. I'm more amenable to making a purchase here. What about you? Andy Cross:I agree with you. She had talked about, the historical growth of beauty is, 2%-5%. They think that will continue to grow. I think they can take some market share. They're making those investments into their stores. That's going to pay out dividends. They have that membership business, members were up 3% this quarter, so not huge growth, but enough because a lot of those membership of which I am now one after joining this weekend, that generates a lot of the growth that they see in the stores and tied to a lot of their new marketing initiatives that Kecia Steelman and her team are taking on. I'd be a buyer of Ulta, even after a little bit this ramp, but don't be greedy. Just nibble. If somebody wants to nibble on that, that's fine. I bought some earlier this year, so I'm pretty happy. Asit Sharma:Andy Cross, I'm going to be looking for you to go back and store and make my nibble worth it later this year. Andy Cross:I'll do that for both of us and all those shareholders who also have followed us into Ulta stock. Asit Sharma thanks so much. Appreciate your thoughts on Ulta, the stock market, and Zscaler. Asit Sharma:This is a lot of fun. Thanks a lot, Andy. Andy Cross:It does it for us here at Motley Fool Money.

Its deep UEFA Europa League run, however, led to better-than-expected revenue gains in the fiscal third quarter. The soccer giant on Friday reported quarterly revenue that surged 17% year-over-year to 160.5 million British pounds ($217.1 million). Analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha had expected 157.3 million pounds ($212.8 million). Manchester United attributed the revenue gains to \"additional matches played in the quarter as a result of strong performance in the UEFA Europa League and high demand for the Club's hospitality offering.\" Manchester United, which has a record-tying 20 top-flight English football league titles, finished 15th in the 20-team Premier League this past season, far below its usual standards.However, it made it to the final of the Europa League, losing 1-0 to Tottenham Hotspur. The company raised its fiscal 2025adjusted EBITDAoutlook to between GBP180 million and GBP190 million from GBP145 million to GBP160 million.It also lifted the low end of its revenue projection to between GBP660 million and GBP670 million, which it sees \"at the higher end\" of the range.

        "content": "We came across abullish thesison NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) on Kontra Investments Substack. In this article, we will summarize the bulls\u2019 thesis on NVDA. NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)'s share was trading at $139.19 as of 29thMay. NVDA\u2019s trailing and forward P/E were 45.85 and 31.25 respectively according to Yahoo Finance. NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) once again exceeded Wall Street expectations, marking its eleventh consecutive quarter of outperformance with first-quarter revenues of $44.06 billion, a 69% increase year-over-year. Profits surged 26% to $18.8 billion, and adjusted EPS reached $0.96, surpassing estimates. Looking ahead, the company forecasts $45 billion in revenue for the upcoming quarter, signaling continued momentum despite geopolitical headwinds, including trade restrictions with China. These restrictions, particularly around the H20 chip, led to an estimated $4.5 billion in lost revenue and inventory write-downs. Still, CEO Jensen Huang remains confident, pointing to the accelerating global demand for AI infrastructure. NVIDIA\u2019s core strengths are anchored in its data center and gaming segments. Data center revenues, led by surging networking demand, totaled $39.1 billion, while gaming came in strong at $5 billion, fueled by the release of Blackwell GPUs. Hyperscale clients are adopting NVL72 racks at an aggressive pace, underscoring NVIDIA\u2019s pivotal role in powering AI deployments. Supply chain concerns have eased, with stabilized inventory and alignment between production and deployment. The company generated $26.2 billion in free cash flow this quarter, enabling ongoing investment and shareholder returns through buybacks. Geographically, NVIDIA is diversifying its revenue base; Singapore\u2019s contribution has grown, while China now accounts for just 13% of revenues. Major global AI projects, including the Stargate initiative, Saudi Arabia\u2019s sovereign AI efforts, and a 5GW UAE campus, point to immense upside. With resilient fundamentals, leading-edge technology, and exposure to AI\u2019s global buildout, NVIDIA remains a premier investment opportunity with strong long-term upside. Previously, we have covered NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) in April 2025 wherein we summarized abullish thesisby Compounding Your Wealth on Substack. The author highlighted NVIDIA\u2019s dominant position in AI and accelerated computing, with its Data Center segment driving 88% of revenue and commanding over 95% of the AI accelerator market. Despite signs of deceleration and margin compression, the article argued that NVIDIA\u2019s strong balance sheet, proprietary CUDA ecosystem, and de-risked valuation offered a compelling long-term growth opportunity. Since our last coverage, the stock is up 25.7% as of 29thMay. NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) is on our list of the30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 212 hedge fund portfolios held NVDA at the end of the first quarter which was 223 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the potential of LYFT as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

The first 200-megawatt chunk was supposed to go live in 2026, operated by OpenAI and Oracle, but nobody's signed off on the chip-export rules yet, so the deal remains on ice.

        "content": "Apple\u2019s (AAPL) annual Worldwide Developers Conference kicks off Monday, when CEO Tim Cook will get a chance to shift the narrative for the iPhone maker as worries abouttariffsand AI feature delayshave weighedon the company\u2019s stock this year. Cook\u2019s keynote is scheduled for 1 p.m. ET Monday and is expected to focus heavily on Apple Intelligence, the company\u2019s hub of AI features.(You canwatch the event here.) Apple could announce new partnerships and apps\u2014including a potential deal with Google that would integrate the Gemini large language model into Apple's AI features, Goldman Sachs analysts said. In April, Alphabet (GOOGL) CEO Sundar Pichai said he hoped Apple and Google could get a deal done by mid-2025, adding that he and Apple\u2019s Cook had multiple discussions about a deal last year, according to reporting fromBloomberg.Apple has previously partnered with OpenAI to utilize ChatGPT for features such as Siri, Goldman noted. Apple is also expected to introduce a new software development kit that would allow third-party developers to build AI apps using the LLMs that power Apple Intelligence, the bank said. During last year's developers conference, Cook had unveiled an AI-enhanced, more personalized Siri voice assistant, capable of performing multi-step tasks within other iPhone apps, but that feature has since beendelayed until 2026. A more specific timeline could come next week, JPMorgan analysts said. This year, Cook is also expected to unveil the latest iOS for iPhone, iPad, Mac, and other devices ahead of the anticipated iPhone 17 launch this fall. The update could introduce some design changes like rounded icons and translucent displays, and add features like AI-optimized battery usage, Goldman Sachs said. Numerically, it would be iOS 19, but Citi analysts said Apple could start numbering the updates by the upcoming calendar year, which would make the new version iOS 26. The event comes after a tough start to the year for Apple, with shares down 18% for 2025 so far, making it the worst-performingMagnificent Sevenstock this year, save for Tesla (TSLA).",

        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) once again proved to the markets, afterreporting its Q1 earnings, that it remains the undisputed leader powering the globalAIrevolution, driven by relentless demand for its chips, even amid ongoing geopolitical and trade headwinds. Easily unpack a company's performancewith TipRanks' new KPI Datafor smart investment decisions Receive undervalued, market resilient stocks right to your inboxwith TipRanks' Smart Value Newsletter Beyond beating all key metrics (excluding one-off events) and offering guidance that resonated well with investors, Nvidia stock experienced a strong post-earnings surge, even if the momentum cooled slightly in the days that followed. That said, there\u2019s arguably still a missing spark needed to fully reignite the stock\u2019s momentum heading into 2025. However, considering the broader growth story, Nvidia continues to trade at a very attractive valuation\u2014one that could deliver meaningful alpha over the long term. Short- to mid-term bumps, especially tied to macro risks in China, are worth monitoring but don\u2019t alter the core thesis. Given the company\u2019s strong execution and still-intact fundamentals, I continue to rate NVDA as aBuy. As I pointed out in aprevious article, for Nvidia stock to perform well after its Q1 Fiscal 2026 results, it wouldn\u2019t be enough to simply beat estimates\u2014it needed to crush them and deliver guidance that topped market expectations. And that\u2019s precisely what Nvidia did. The company reported revenue of $44 billion (as shown in the chart below), beating its own guidance of $43 billion\u2014a massive 69% increase year-over-year. Gross margins, which had been a point of concern during the early stages of Blackwell\u2019s rollout, came in at 71.3% (excluding the H20 charge, afinancial write-off tied to its China-specific H20 GPUs). That\u2019s also above the guided range of 70.6% to 71%. Even more impressive was the Q2 guidance.Nvidia is projecting $45 billion in revenue, with a margin of plus or minus 2%. At the high end, that\u2019s $45.9 billion\u2014above the ~$45.5 billion consensus estimate leading into earnings day. Margins are expected to rise again, landing between 71.8% and 72.0%, with a margin of error of approximately 50 basis points. At the top of that range, it suggests another round of margin expansion, which is exactly what investors wanted to hear. The company continues to state that once Blackwell production is fully ramped, margins could move into the 70\u201380% range over the next few quarters. This stronger-than-expected performance, along with the recovery in margins, led tolong-term EPS estimates getting bumped up by around 9%starting in FY2029. Revenue projections for those years were also revised higher by roughly 8%. Not surprisingly, Nvidia shares jumped more than 5% in after-hours trading following the earnings release, although the stock mostly leveled off in the sessions since. In my view, the muted post-earnings reaction is actually a positive sign\u2014it shows the market didn\u2019t see enough red flags to justify a selloff in Nvidia stock. However, bears argue that even with revenue jumping nearly 70% year-over-year, signs of fatigue in the growth story are evident, with sequential growth of just 12% potentially indicating that Nvidia\u2019s explosive momentum is entering a more seasonal or plateauing phase. For a company priced for hypergrowth, this kind of quarter-over-quarter slowdown can be an early warning signal. And it\u2019s not just about the numbers\u2014geopolitical and regulatory pressures are starting to have real consequences. The U.S. export restrictions on AI chips like the H20 led to a $4.5 billion write-down and forced Nvidia to walk away from an estimated $15 billion in potential sales to China. That\u2019s not just a short-term financial hit\u2014it also opens the door for competitors like Huawei to gain ground, especially as they accelerate domestic chip development. Although analysts have raised long-term estimates following Q1, there remains a genuine possibility that Nvidia\u2019s global dominance could face challenges over time, particularly if policy pressures persist. When factoring in the impact of the H20 write-off, Q1 would have been the first quarter since the AI boom began in which Nvidia did not achieve sequential growth. And for a stock valued for perfection, even a modest slowdown can pose a valuation risk. To me, the bigger issue here is that this goes beyond Nvidia\u2014it\u2019s about the strategic direction of U.S. tech leadership. As CEO, Jensen Huang has warned that if the U.S. continues down this restrictive path without a more balanced strategy, it may ultimately strengthen Huawei and erode America\u2019s edge in AI. That\u2019s the kind of long-term headwind that bears are likely to latch onto as the growth narrative gets more complicated. But setting the macro risks aside, Nvidia\u2019s bull case remains intact after Q1, especially when considering its growth. The company continues to stand out as a GARP (growth at a reasonable price) opportunity. Currently, Nvidia trades at 31.6x forward earnings, with a consensus growth rate of 29% CAGR over the next three to five years. This results in a PEG ratio of just 1x\u2014virtually identical to Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), despite AMD\u2019s significantly slower growth outlook, and significantly lower than most of the other Magnificent 7 names. Of course, for that valuation to hold up, Nvidia\u2019s growth trajectory needs to remain clean and strong. But honestly, it\u2019s hard to think of another company with Nvidia\u2019s size and scale, this level of fundamental quality, and such massive exposure to secular tailwinds like AI, trading at such an attractive growth-adjusted valuation. Among the 40 analysts who\u2019ve covered NVDA in the past three months, there\u2019s hardly any room for doubt: 35 rate the stock as aBuy, while only four suggestHold. Not a single analyst rates NVDA stock as aSell. Currently,NVDA\u2019s average stock price target is $173.57, implying a potential upside of 22% from the current share price. Setting aside one-off events, Nvidia left the bears with almost nothing to complain about\u2014crushing its own guidance and delivering a Q2 forecast that dispels doubts about how quickly gross margins are recovering. While risks like evolving U.S. sanctions on China, Nvidia\u2019s ability to maintain its presence in that market, and rising local competition are worth keeping an eye on, they don\u2019t outweigh the current risk-reward of going long, especially given the company\u2019s strong growth trajectory.

        "content": "As the government removes warnings on holding cryptocurrency in retirement accounts, some savers might consider now a good time to include the virtual asset in their portfolio. The Department of Labor (DOL) last weekrescinded guidancethat called for employers to use \u201cextreme caution\u201d when including the option to hold cryptocurrency in retirement accounts. Some financial experts said the change likely won't sway retirement savers in either direction. However, many suggest you consider your retirement timeline and risk tolerance if you want to addcryptoto your retirement account assets. The rewardmayoutweigh the risk. It diversifies your portfolio. The risk is high. Investment options are limited. It doesn't accrue interest or dividends like traditional accounts. The biggest reason people might consider holding crypto in a retirement account is that the payoff could be tremendous. For example, the price of bitcoin has risen by more than 11% so far this year. At the same time, the S&P 500 has only grown 2%. However, that's not always guaranteed, as bitcoin has had one of themost volatile trading historiesacross asset classes. Investopedia / Alice Morgan \"It makes the most sense for those with long horizons, an informed view of the market, and the financial flexibility to withstand downturns without jeopardizing retirement security,\" said Kwamie Dunbar, associate professor of finance at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. Another appeal to holding crypto in your retirement account is thediversificationit brings to your portfolio, said David Yermack, director of the New York University Pollack Center for Law and Business. \"Ideally, an investor should be as diversified as possible, and crypto should be treated the same as any other asset, including stocks, bonds, real estate, commodities, and so forth,\" Yermack said. Unlike traditionalfixed incomeor equity assets, most crypto options don't accrue interest or dividends while sitting in a retirement account, Dunbar said. But experts say the biggest downside of holding crypto in your retirement account is the risk that could come from it. Cryptocurrencies are considered unstable and subject to drastic price swings. \"Anyone who invests in crypto should recognize that it has historically suffered a number of sudden, steep price drops,\" said Yermack, who also said that retirement savers contemplating crypto holdings should know \"they could lose most of the investment very quickly.\" If a large percentage of your assets are in crypto and it goes down, that could tank yourretirement savings. Because of this, Yermack suggests only holding a small amount of crypto in your retirement account if you decide it's the right fit for your plans. \"Cryptocurrencies are highlyvolatile. For younger investors or those with a higher risk appetite, crypto may serve as a speculative growth component within a diversified retirement portfolio,\" Dunbar said. \"For older investors closer to retirement, wherecapital preservationand income are paramount, crypto\u2019s volatility may outweigh its benefits.\"",

This rise stems from an analyst atWells Fargoraising theirprice targeton the stock from $107 to $125, naming Shopify a \"signature pick.\" AlthoughNvidia,Palantir, OpenAI, and others capture most of theartificial intelligence (AI)fanfare, the analyst believes Shopify could prove to be a thematic AI story -- and I'd agree. In April this year, a leaked memo fromChief Executive OfficerTobi L\u00fctke went viral. In it, he stated, \"Before asking for more headcount and resources, teams must demonstrate why they cannot get what they want done using AI.\" Although this focuses on incorporating AI into Shopify's operations, the quote highlights that AI will be at the heart of what the company does going forward, whether internally or through its products.

In 2023, the company launched Shopify Magic, a toolbox of AI-powered solutions (think AI-generated product descriptions or email campaigns, automated chat help, or image editing). Then, it launched Sidekick -- an AI-driven commerce assistant -- in 2024 to help with areas such as inventory optimization, pricing strategies, and gathering business insights. Just last quarter, Shopify launched TariffGuide.ai. This tool enables merchants to source products more effectively, allowing them to navigate the complex tariff environment in real time. Adding over 600 new product features for its merchants in the last two years alone, Shopify appears likely to remain an AI innovator rather than a disruptee, in my opinion.

The news sent CoreWeave\u2019s stock soaring by more than 40% over the next few days. Such double digit percentage gains have become par for the course during CoreWeave\u2019s brief life as a publicly traded stock.

The average price target among all analysts who cover the stock is $72.61, well below the $145 level Coreweave was trading at on Friday and the 52-week high of $166.63. Some analysts believe the demand for the stock is being driven by retail investors who, on average,engage in contrarian and momentum-driventrading and may be eager to invest in CoreWeave due to its multi-billion dollar contracts with Nvidia, OpenAI,Microsoftand other major companies propelling AI. It\u2019s worth noting that institutional investors like Coatue Management and Jane Street do hold CoreWeave positions worth over $1 billion each. Big announcements like the Applied Digital leases are one factor driving up shares of the stock. An even more fundamental dynamic is that investors are looking for ways to capitalize on the success of OpenAI, which is privately held, and see CoreWeave as one of the few vehicles for exposure in the public markets. OpenAI owns a percentage of CoreWeave andsigned a multi-billion dealas its cloud infrastructure provider until April 2029. Plus, CoreWeave is a preferred partner of Nvidia, currentlythe most valuable company in the worldby market cap, which is also an investor in CoreWeave. CoreWeave \u201cis positioned to capture meaningful share of an AI cloud provider market growing at a server-melting pace,\u201d wrote Mizuho\u2019s Gregg Moskowitz, who has an \u201coutperform\u201d rating on the stock, in a note after the company\u2019s released its quarterly earnings report in mid-May. In the first quarter, CoreWeavebeat revenue estimatesby over 10% and forecasted second-quarter above consensus predictions, too, perYahooFinance. Moskowitz and the other optimistic CoreWeave analysts did not respond toFortunerequests for comment. Coreweave posted revenue of $981.6 million in the first three months of the year, up a staggering 420% from the year-ago period. The meteoric growth reflects Coreweave\u2019s well-timedpivot to AI. Founded in 2017 by three commodity traders, Coreweave began as an ethereum mining company. In 2019 it pivoted to cloud infrastructure to enhance GPU capabilities, attracting investment and chips from Nvidia\u2013beginning its journey to the upper echelons of AI computing. The company\u2019spublic market debut was not auspicious. Coreweave reduced the price range of the offering, and the stock finished its first day trading just one penny above its $40 IPO price. For analysts skeptical about CoreWeave\u2019s value, their dim view is driven by the company\u2019s\u00a0 debt-saddled balance sheet,its ultra-dependence on Microsoft, and customers\u2019 development of proprietary technologies to replace contracts with the cloud computing company. The bullishness of day traders and bearishness of investment professionals may be creating a short squeeze situationsimilar to the GameStopone that rocked markets in 2021 by causing the stock to go from $17 to $483 over the course of a month. The volatility of the CoreWeave in this instance is amplified by its low float\u2014meaning that only a small amount of shares are available for purchase. It would make sense that CoreWeave could be a short squeeze target: short interest is approximately 8.44% of its float, well above the 2% to 5% average across U.S. stocks, though still far below the 140% of GameStop near the onset of its famous squeeze. One Coreweave short seller experiencing the squeeze is Felix Wang, a managing director and partner at Hedgeye Risk Management. Yet, Wang maintains his short position despite facing potentially enormous losses. His argument is multifaceted but boils down to the company\u2019s net debt, lease liabilities and its dependence on Microsoft and a tiny handful of others for the bulk of its revenues. \u201cInvestors should be more concerned about their operating and financial obligations,\u201d he tellsFortune. This is because the company has a 387% debt-to-equity ratio, -38.7% profit margin and $11.9 billion debt with just $1.28 billion in cash. These fundamentals combined with the fact that Microsoft accounted for over 70% of CoreWeave\u2019s revenue last quarter leads Wang to compare CoreWeave toWeWorkat the time of its failed 2019 IPO. Wang looks at CoreWeave\u2019s creditorsBlackstoneand Magnetar Financial. He says that these lenders are currently charging CoreWeave 10% to 15% interest on its debt and will have provisions to charge higher interest and accelerate the repayment schedule if CoreWeave\u2019s clients like Microsoft end or downgrade partnerships with the cloud provider. \u201cIf your customers are the most highly-rated AAA clients in the world, other than OpenAI, then why are you paying 10% to 15% interest by yield on your debt agreements?\u201d ask Wangs. CoreWeave\u2019s debt obligations have, in-part, led D.A. Davidson Head of Research Gil Luria to rate the stock as an underperformer. He explains that CoreWeave\u2019s debt obligations are so large that equity holders own a very little portion of the company. Plus, CoreWeave customers Microsoft andGoogleare building products to directly compete with it, he says. \u201cThe only reason that they\u2019re using CoreWeave is that CoreWeave was able to build quickly enough while Microsoft and Google weren\u2019t getting enough chips from Nvidia,\u201d leading them to ink three- or five-year deals with CoreWeave, he says. \u201cTheir need for CoreWeave will go away within the life of the contract.\u201d These incredulous analysts may be vindicated in September when the lockup period on the IPO expires in September and restricted shareholders can offload their CoreWeave holdings and the stock price will drop. But as CoreWeave\u2019s stock bounced back Friday after plunging 17% on Thursday, perhaps the only thing that\u2019s clear is that the AI company will continue to leave believers, and skeptics, scratching their heads.

        "content": "Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump'spublic feudrattled Tesla shares this week, but several Wall Street analysts said they're still bullish on the stock. Wedbush analysts led by Dan Ives, with a $500 price target leading Wall Street analysts tracked by Visible Alpha, called the back-and-forth \"jaw dropping and a shock to the market,\" but said the \"feud does not change our bullish view of Tesla and the autonomous view.\" However, they said it could \"put a fly in the ointment\" regarding earlier expectations that Musk and Trump's relationship could ease the regulatory path for Tesla to get approvals for its self-driving software and other products. Tesla remains a stock that has divided analysts, with 10 of those tracked by Visible Alpha issuing \"buy\" ratings, while four have \"hold,\" and four have \"sell\" ratings. Their price targets range from as low as $120, implying a nearly 60% drop from Friday's close, to Wedbush's $500 at the higher end. The stock added about 4% to close at $295.58 Friday, after tumbling 14% Thursday. Morgan Stanley analysts, with a $410 price target, said the deteriorating relationship between Musk and Trump could further dent Tesla's sales as it \"could potentially (temporarily) alienate multiple sides of the political spectrum.\" Still, they added they're \"not convinced the longer-term vectors that drive the stock's value have changed here,\" pointing to Tesla's leadership in robotics, autonomous driving, and artificial intelligence technology. Oppenheimer analysts were more cautious, saying the \"difficult work at TSLA is just beginning as the company starts to repair brand damage while executing on its Physical AI strategy.\" Ahead of the EV maker's expected launch of its robotaxi service next week, the analysts said they \"continue to see challenges in TSLA's autonomy platform,\" as issues could arise with its cameras or software. Teslashares were amongthe biggest gainers on the S&P 500 on Friday, winning back some of Thursday's losses. They've lost roughly one-quarter of their value since the start of the year, with Thursday's drop knocking Tesla out of the$1 trillion market cap club.

        "content": "Broadcom (AVGO) shares fell sharply Friday, one day after thechip giant delivered resultsand an outlook that were largely in line with Wall Street estimates. The company's shares hit a freshrecord highthis week ahead of its highly anticipated results, boosted by expectations of robust revenue growth driven by surging demand for chips that powergenerative AItechnology. CEO Hock Tan told analysts on the company\u2019searnings callthat chip demand may accelerate during the second half of 2026 due to strong inference demand, referring to the process that uses a trained AI model to make predictions or decisions. Still, Broadcom shares fell 5% to around $247 on Friday as the results and outlook may have missed the lofty expectations of investors, especially after theblockbuster results delivered by rival Nvidialast week. With today's decline, Broadcom shares are up about 6% since the start of the year, slightly outpacing the performance of the S&P 500 index over that stretch. Let\u2019s break down thetechnicalson Broadcom\u2019s chart and identify key price levels worth watching out for. After plumbing a seven-month low in early April, Broadcom shares have trended sharply higher within arising wedge, with the price testing the pattern\u2019s upper trendline in recent trading sessions. However,profit-takingcrept into the stock Thursday on the highestvolumein around two months, which set the stage for today's selling.

Let\u2019s identify keysupport levelson Broadcom\u2019s chart to watch amid the potential for further selling and also locate an important overhead area worth monitoring during recovery efforts in the stock. Coming into Friday's session, the $250 level found aconfluenceof support from the rising wedge pattern\u2019s lower trendline and three notablepeaksthat formed on the chart between December and January.

        "content": "Major U.S. equities indexes pushed higher to close out the trading week. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the U.S. economyadded 139,000 jobs in May, topping economists' forecasts and helping alleviate concerns about a tariff-driven slowdown in the labor market. The S&P 500 gained 1% on Friday, closing above the 6,000-point level for the first time since February. The Dow was up 1.1%, while the Nasdaq jumped 1.2%. Shares of big data analytics software provider Palantir Technologies (PLTR) popped 6.5% higher, securing the top daily performance in the S&P 500. Positivity around its expanding government business helped lift Palantir to an all-time high on Tuesday, but before Friday's gains, the stock had been pulling back for a couple of sessions. Palantir and other artificial intelligence companies benefited from upbeat sentiment after earnings results from chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO) revealed strong AI demand. Moderna (MRNA) shares wrapped up a volatile week of trading with a gain of 5.1% on Friday. The biotech company announced at the end of last week that it hadreceived Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approvalfor the use of its new COVID-19 vaccine by older and higher-risk patients. On Tuesday, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said Moderna had agreed to a placebo-controlled trial of the vaccine. United Airlines (UAL) announced a partnership with Spotify Technology (SPOT) that will allow airborne passengers to access playlists, audiobooks, and video podcasts from the streaming service on their seatback screens. United shares increased 4.8% on Friday, while rival carrier Delta Air Lines (DAL) shares\u00a0were up 4.3%. Tesla (TSLA) shares advanced 3.7% on Friday as the feud between Tesla CEO Elon Musk and U.S. President Donald Trump showed signs of de-escalation heading into the weekend. The spat between the two contributed toa major dropin the electric vehicle (EV) maker's stock in the prior session. Several analystsreaffirmed their bullishness on Tesladespite the high-profile conflict, but they noted that the tensions with Trump could complicate the regulatory path for the firm's self-driving technology or risk alienating people with certain political perspectives. Lululemon Athletica (LULU) issuedlower-than-expected sales and profit guidancefor the current quarter and trimmed its full-year profit forecast. The maker of yoga attire and other athletic apparel noted that U.S. consumers are taking a cautious approach to spending and discussed plans to increase prices on some products as it aims to mitigate tariff impacts. Lululemon shares plunged 19.8% on Friday, dropping the most of any constituent in the S&P 500. JPMorgan and UBS analysts cut their price targets on Lululemon stock following the underwhelming outlook. Broadcom posted fiscal second-quarter sales and adjusted profit results that were roughly in line with consensus forecasts. Amajor year-over-year uptickin artificial intelligence semiconductor revenue helped the chipmaker achieve record quarterly revenue of $15 billion. However, Broadcom shares slipped 5% on Friday, receding from astring of record highsnotched before the earnings release. Mosaic (MOS), a provider of fertilizers and other agricultural products, reduced its 2025 phosphate production guidance, citing operational issues at its U.S. facilities.

        "content": "The full article continues below these offers from our partners. Holding a cash safety cushion is always a good idea. And given the currenteconomic uncertaintyunleashed by President Donald Trump's on-again, off-againtariffpolicy, parking some cash in reserve feels feels even more important. But whether you're holding savings in the bank or are shifting funds from more volatile investments, it's important to consider how much you can earn from different cash strategies. Fortunately, the options are excellent right now, as returns continue to be buoyed by the fact that theFederal Reserve'sbenchmark federal funds interest rateremains high. Not only that, but it appears likely the central bank will keep the fed funds rate where it is for two more meetings. According to theCME Group's FedWatch Tool, financial markets are currently pricing in an 83% probability that the first 2025 rate cut won't come before the Fed's Sept. 17 rate announcement. That would be good news for savers, as the rates that banks, credit unions, and brokerages are willing to pay on your savings are directly impacted by thefederal funds rate. Anytime the Fed cuts that benchmark rate, yields for savings, money market, and CD accounts fall as well. For an attractive interest rate that involves virtually no risk, the options for safe cash investment come in three main flavors: You can choose just one of these or mix and match products for different buckets of funds and timelines. In any case, you'll want to understand what each product pays. Below, we lay out today's top rates in every category as of Friday's market close, and indicate the change from a week prior. The rates below are the top nationally availableannual percentage yields (APYs)from federally insured banks and credit unions, based on our daily rate research of more than 200 institutions that offer nationwide products. Note thatsavings and money market account rates are variable, meaning the bank is free to lower them at any time. In contrast, CD rates are locked and guaranteed for the certificate's full term. The yield on money market funds fluctuates daily, while rates on cash management accounts are more fixed but can change at any time. Treasury securities pay their ratethrough maturityand can be bought directly from TreasuryDirect or bought and sold on the secondary market via a bank or brokerage. I bonds must bebought from TreasuryDirectand can be held for up to 30 years, with rates adjusted every six months. Here's a different look at all of the cash vehicles above, sorted by rate. Note that the rates shown are the highest qualifying rate for each product type. Savings Accounts The most basic place to stash cash is a bank or credit union savings account\u2014sometimes called ahigh-yield savings account\u2014that lets you add and withdraw money as you please. But don't assume your primary bank pays a competitive rate. Some banks pay virtually zero interest. Fortunately, we make shopping for a high rate easy. Our daily ranking of the best high-yield savings accounts gives you more than 20 options thatpay 4.30% to 5.00% APY. Note, however, that savings account rates can change at any time. Money Market Accounts Amoney market accountis a savings account that lets you write paper checks. If this is a useful feature to you, shop our list of the best money market accounts. If you don't need paper check-writing, choose whichever account type\u2014money market or savings\u2014pays the better rate. Thetop money market account rateis currently 4.37%. Again, be aware that money market rates are variable, so they can be lowered without warning. Certificates of Deposit Acertificate of deposit (CD)is a bank or credit union product with a fixed interest rate that promises a guaranteed return for a set period of time. Generally ranging from 3 months to 5 years, CDs offer a predictable return with a rate that cannot be changed for the duration of the term. But be aware that it's a commitment with teeth: If you cash in before maturity, your earnings will be dinged with an early withdrawal penalty. Our daily ranking of the best nationwide CDs currently includes 16 optionspaying at least 4.50%\u2014with a top rate of 4.60% APY. Money Market Funds Unlike a money market account at a bank,money marketfundsare mutual funds invested in cash and offered by brokerage and robo-advisor firms. Their yields can fluctuate daily but currently range from 3.95% to 4.21% at the three biggest brokerages. Cash Management Accounts For uninvested cash held at abrokerageorrobo-advisor, you can have the funds \"swept\" into a cash management account where they will earn a return. Unlike money market funds, cash management accounts offer a specific interest rate that the brokerage or robo-advisor can adjust whenever it likes. Currently, several popular brokers are paying 3.83% to 4.00% APY on their cash accounts. Treasury Bills, Notes, and Bonds TheU.S. Treasuryoffers a wide array of short- and long-term bond instruments. Treasury bills have the shortest duration, ranging from 4 to 52 weeks, while Treasury notes have a maturity of 2 to 5 years. The longest-term option is a Treasury bond, which has a 20- or 30-year maturity. Today's rates on the various Treasury products range from 4.02% to 4.99%. You canbuy T-bills, notes, and bondsstraight fromTreasuryDirector buy and sell them on the secondary market at brokerages and banks.Selling a Treasury product allows you to exit before the bond matures. However, you may pay a fee or commission for secondary market purchases and sales, while buying and redeeming at TreasuryDirect\u2014the U.S. Treasury\u2019s online platform for buying federal government securities\u2014has no fees. You can also buyTreasury ETFs, which trade on the market like a stock. Treasury ETFs have advantages and limitations, which youcan read about here. I Bonds U.S. TreasuryI bondshave a rate that's adjusted every six months to align with inflation trends.You can redeem an I bond anytime after one year or hold it for as long as 30 years. While you own the bond, your rate will change every six months. I bond rates just went up on May 1, from 3.11% for bonds issued during the previous six months to 3.98% for new bonds purchased between May 1 and Oct. 31, 2025. ForexistingI bond holders, your next six-month rate will also increase\u2014by almost a full percentage point. See our story aboutthe recent rate change, including rate tables for different bond dates. Every business day, Investopedia tracks the rate data of more than 200 banks and credit unions that offer CDs and savings accounts to customers nationwide and determines daily rankings of the top-paying accounts. To qualify for our lists, the institution must be federally insured (FDICfor banks,NCUAfor credit unions), and the account's minimum initial deposit must not exceed $25,000. It also cannot specify amaximumdeposit amount that's below $5,000. Banks must be available in at least 40 states to qualify as nationally available. And while some credit unions require you to donate to a specific charity or association to become a member if you don't meet other eligibility criteria (e.g., you don't live in a certain area or work in a certain kind of job), we exclude credit unions whose donation requirement is $40 or more.
