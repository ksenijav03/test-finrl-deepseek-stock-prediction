        "content": "By Wayne Cole SYDNEY (Reuters) -Asia shares firmed on Monday as seemingly unquenchable demand for technology companies lifted S&P 500 futures to another all-time peak, while the dollar dipped on concerns U.S. jobs data will show enough weakness to justify larger rate cuts. Investors were also keeping a wary eye on the progress of a huge U.S. tax-cutting and spending bill slowly making its way through the Senate, with signs it may not make it by President Donald Trump's preferred July 4 deadline. The Congressional Budget Office estimated the bill would add $3.3 trillion to the nation's debt, testing foreign appetite for U.S. Treasuries. There was no doubting the demand for the U.S. tech sector and megacap growth stocks including Nvidia, Alphabet and Amazon. Nasdaq futures rose another 0.3%, while S&P 500 e-minis added 0.2%. The bullish sentiment spilled over into Japan's Nikkei which rose 1.0%, while South Korean stocks gained 0.5%. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan firmed 0.1%. A holiday on Friday means U.S. payrolls are a day early, with analysts forecasting a rise of 110,000 in June with the jobless rate ticking up to 4.3%. The resilience of the labour market is a major reason the majority of Federal Reserve members say they can afford to wait on cutting rates until they can gauge the true impact of tariffs on inflation, so a weak report would stoke speculation of a rate cut in July rather than September. \"While initial jobless claims retreated somewhat from their recent high, continuing claims jumped higher yet again,\" noted Michael Feroli, head of U.S. economics at JPMorgan. \"Consumers' assessment of labor market conditions also deteriorated in the latest confidence report.\" \"Both of these developments suggest that the unemployment rate in June should tick up to 4.3%, with a significant risk of reaching 4.4%.\" The latter outcome would likely see futures push up the chance of a July easing from the current 18% and price in more than the present 63 basis points of cuts for this year. DOLLAR DOLDRUMS Fed Chair Jerome Powell will have an opportunity to repeat his cautious outlook when he joins several other central bank chiefs at the European Central Bank forum in Sintra on Tuesday. The prospect of an eventual policy easing has helped Treasuries weather worries about the U.S. budget deficit and the huge amount of borrowing it entails. Yields on 10-year Treasuries were steady at 3.27%, having fallen 9 basis points last week. The dollar has not fared so well, in part due to concerns tariffs and chaotic policies from the White House will drag on economic growth and erode the country's claim to exceptionalism. The euro was near its highest since September 2021 at $1.1731, having climbed 1.7% last week, while sterling stood near a similar peak at $1.3719. The dollar was down a fraction at 144.48 yen, after losing 1% last week, while the dollar index dipped to 97.163. James Reilly, a senior markets economist at Capital Economics, noted the dollar had fallen by more at this stage in the year than in any previous year since the U.S. moved to a free-floating exchange rate in 1973. \"At this point, further weakness could become self-reinforcing as underhedged European/Asian portfolios chase the move,\" he added. \"So, we suspect that this could be a pivotal period for the greenback \u2013 either it turns around here or there is another 5% or so fall around the corner.\" In commodity markets, the general revival in risk sentiment has undermined gold, which slipped to $3,266 an ounce and further away from April's record top of $3,500. [GOL/] Oil prices continued to struggle on concerns about plans for increased output from OPEC+, which contributed to a 12% slide last week. [O/R] Brent dropped a further 55 cents to $67.22 a barrel, while U.S. crude eased 68 cents to $64.84 per barrel. (Reporting by Wayne ColeEditing by Shri Navaratnam)",

        "header": "Nvidia Will Be Wall Street's First $6 Trillion Company, According to One Highly Optimistic Analyst",
        "content": "Roughly three decades ago, the advent and proliferation of the internet began changing corporate America forever. Although it took many years before businesses figured out how to optimize their internet usage to maximize their margins and profits, it became a game-changing technology that helped companies reach new customers. For 30 years, Wall Street and investors have been waiting for the next technological leap that could catapult corporate growth. After a long wait,artificial intelligence (AI)looks to be the answer. Image source: Getty Images. With AI, software and systems are given the capacity to make split-second decisions without human assistance. It's a broad-reaching technology that the analysts at PwC believe can increase global gross domestic product by a whopping 26% come 2030. While a laundry list of businesses has benefited from the AI revolution, none has reaped the rewards of this technological leap forward more than semiconductor titanNvidia(NVDA0.30%). Since the end of 2022, Nvidia's market cap has catapulted from $360 billion to an all-time closing high of $3.76 trillion, as of June 25. But according to one highly optimistic Wall Street analyst, the stock market's AI darling is just warming up and on its way to a greater than $6 trillion valuation. To be fair, buy ratings are a dime a dozen when it comes to Nvidia. As of June, 66 Wall Street analysts had issued a rating on Nvidia, with a combined 58 listing it as the equivalent of a strong buy or buy.That compares with just one sell rating. However, the June 25 update from Loop Capital analyst John Donovan stands out from the crowd for one particular reason: His and his firm's price target is head and shoulders above everyone else's. Donovan lifted Loop Capital's price target for Nvidia from $175 per share to $250. If Nvidia's share count stays static, we're talking about a $6.1 trillion market cap if Donovan's issued price target is achieved. Nvidia is already theundisputed leader in graphics processing units(GPUs) deployed in AI-accelerated data centers. The company's Hopper (H100) and successor Blackwell GPUs have consistently been backlogged due to overwhelming demand. With demand for AI-GPUs handily outpacing their supply, Nvidia has been able to charge a premium for its hardware, which in turn has sent its gross margin to north of 70%. But Donovan only sees this dominance building. In his note to investors that explained Loop Capital's Street-high price target, Donovan pointed to Nvidia shipping an estimated 6.5 million GPUs this year and 7.5 million next year, with average selling prices for these GPUs topping $40,000. For context, Nvidia has enjoyed a 100% to 300% pricing premium over its AI-GPU direct rivals. More specifically, in speaking with various cloud-service providers, Donovan anticipates that an uptick in data center spending from governments, midsize cloud providers, and startup companies can lead to the next wave of supercharged growth for Nvidia. For instance,CoreWeave'spurchase of 250,000 Hopper chipsis the perfect example of startups angling to capitalize on the presumed insatiable demand for compute capacity. The other factor working in Nvidia's favor is that it's been able to grow into its valuation over the last year. Given the company's torrid sales and profit growth, Nvidia is trading at aforward-year earnings multipleof only 27 for fiscal 2027, which will end in January 2027. If Loop Capital's dart throw proves accurate, Nvidia can tip the scales as Wall Street's first $4 trillion, $5 trillion, and $6 trillion business. Image source: Getty Images. While there's no disputing Nvidia's monopoly-like market share of GPUs being deployed in AI-accelerated data centers,there are a couple of tangible headwindsDonovan appears to be overlooking that can send Nvidia stock in the opposite direction. Arguably the biggest issue for Nvidia is thatevery game-changing technology and innovation needs ample time to mature, and we're not at that point yet with artificial intelligence. Including the advent of the internet in the mid-1990s, there hasn't been a next-big-thing trend in three decades that's escaped a bubble-bursting event early in its expansion. The fact thatmost businesses aren't generating a positive return on their AI investments, nor have they optimized their existing AI solutions, suggests that investors have grossly overestimated the early-innings adoption rate and utility of this technology. This bodes poorly for Nvidia stock over the short run. It's also impossible to overlook growing competitive pressure. Don't get me wrong,CEO Jensen Huang's aggressive innovation timeline, which will bring a new advanced GPU to market annually, should have no trouble keeping Nvidia in the lead when it comes to compute potential. But there's more to data center infrastructure than just speed. It can be argued that Nvidia's biggest competitive edge has been the persistent scarcity of AI-GPUs. But withTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturingramping up its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate capacity andAdvanced Micro Devicesupping its production of Instinct series AI-accelerating chips, direct competition is growing.  Growing competition is expected to weigh on Nvidia's gross margin.NVDA Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly)data byYCharts. What's more,many of Nvidia's top customers by net sales are internally developing GPUsto use in their data centers. Even though this internally developed hardware trails Nvidia's Hopper and Blackwell in terms of compute potential, it's notably cheaper and more readily accessible (i.e., not backlogged). Internally developed chips could easily take up valuable data-center real estate, delay future upgrade cycles, and pressure Nvidia's gross margin. Lastly, Donovan's research overlooks the sustained priciness of Nvidia stock relative to its trailing-12-month (TTM) sales. Over the past three decades, megacap companies on the leading edge a next-big-thing trend have historically topped out at TTMprice-to-sales (P/S) ratiosof roughly 30 to 43. Even Nvidia topped out at a TTM P/S multiple of just over 42 last summer. Although the company's rapidly expanding sales has brought this multiple down, it's still tipping the scales at a P/S ratio of almost 26. That's well over double other market-leading \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks, and history strongly suggests it's not sustainable.",

        "content": "Rewind to early 2023 -- few believed thatNvidia(NVDA1.74%)could climb any higher. It already felt expensive and fully priced. Then it surged nearly tenfold, reshaping itself from a chip supplier into a globalartificial intelligence(AI) infrastructure behemoth. Today, with a market cap of $3.5 trillion, it's not about whether Nvidia dominates the AI landscape, it's about what's next. Image source: Getty Images. In its most recent quarter (the first quarter of fiscal 2026, ended April 27), Nvidia delivered a jaw-dropping $44.1 billion in revenue, up 69% year over year. For perspective, that's more thanStarbucksandNetflixearn combined in a quarter. Of that total, $39.1 billion came from the data center segment, representing a 73% increase year over year. These results reflect the dramatic demand for the company's AI infrastructure from enterprises and governments. Several major growth drivers remain intact.\u00a0Enterprises and cloud providers are investing aggressively in data centers and AI infrastructure. The AI data center market is expected to be worth nearly $100 billion  by 2030. The company's Blackwell architecture chips, the successors to the widely adopted Hopper chips, are already seeing strong demand from hyperscalers and enterprises, primarily for AI inference workloads (deploying AI models in a production environment) -- far ahead of supply. To cater to the demand, Nvidia reserved full production  capacity at Wistron's new Taiwan plant through 2026 for Blackwell and Rubin AI servers. Nvidia is no longer just a chipmaker. It now offers a full-stack solution to accelerated computing needs. From hardware to software and networking, Nvidia's ecosystem supports high-performance and low-latency deployment. Nvidia's software offerings are contributing recurring and high-margin revenue streams. Hence, as software becomes a larger portion of the company's overall revenue mix, gross margin can increase from the already high 61%. Beyond data centers, Nvidia is also positioned to benefit from the increasing demand for AI technologies across new use cases in areas such as automotive, edge AI, robotics, and industrial design. These use cases are still developing but can prove significant catalysts in the long run. Despite its many pros, Nvidia has its share of risks. Nvidia is facing revenue headwinds due to restrictions on international exports, especially to China. The company estimated a loss in H20 chip revenue of around $8 billion in the second quarter due to U.S. export controls for China. In the event of escalating geopolitical tensions, this poses a significant risk to Nvidia. Competition is also heating up.Advanced Micro Devicesis catching up, while hyperscalers such asAlphabetandAmazonare also developing custom chips. Analysts now estimate the stock's 12-month price target around $176, with the highest target estimate of $250 and the lowest of $100. To see if these estimates make sense, let's use consensus analyst estimates for Nvidia's earnings per share (EPS). Analysts are estimating Nvidia's  EPS to be $4.32, $5.72, and $6.44 in fiscal 2026, fiscal 2027, and fiscal 2028, respectively. Nvidia is trading at 36 times  forward earnings. Applying a more conservative multiple of 30x, (down from today's elevated levels but suitable for a high-growth technology stock), and you get a three-year price target of around $193 -- roughly 25% upside from today's levels, or around 7% compound annual growth rate (CAGR). This does not seem a very attractive proposition in the current high-inflation environment. However, if Nvidia's bull case holds, then the company's EPS can reach $7.63  in fiscal 2028 and enjoy a premium multiple of 35x (more in line with current levels). In that case, the company's share price can be nearly $267 at the end of 2028 -- around 73% up from today's level, or a 20% CAGR. Finally, in the bear case, Nvidia's EPS is estimated to be around $5.11  and forward P/E multiple can be close to 25 (the lower end for a high-growth company), translating into a $127.11 share price. This would be almost 17% lower than today's price. Nvidia's valuation already incorporates a significant amount of optimism, and the base case, with 7% annual returns, may not adequately justify the risk in a high-interest rate environment. While there is upside potential, the stock currently makes sense primarily for long-term investors with a high risk appetite who are very optimistic about the AI infrastructure opportunity.",

        "content": "A group of technology stocks, known as the \"Magnificent Seven\" -- a nod to the 1960 Western -- led stock market gains last year and has started to rebound in recent times. Which one makes the best buy for the second half? The answer to that question isNvidia(NVDA1.74%), even though the stock has already climbed 800% over the past three years. Let's find out why this top artificial intelligence (AI) stock may still be in the early days of its growth story. Image source: Getty Images. Nvidia has played a key role since the first days of the AI boom, and this is because it designs the crucial element that makes AI work: chips. They're known as graphics processing units (GPUs), and they power the fundamental step of training AI models, a process that allows those models to then handle complex tasks and solve real-world problems. So, without these chips, we wouldn't have AI.\u00a0This helped Nvidia's revenue take off a few years ago, as you can see in the chart below.  NVDA Revenue (Annual)data byYCharts. In Nvidia's earlier days, it primarily served the video gaming market, which resulted in progressive growth, but revenue levels were a far cry from today's AI-driven revenue. This is because companies realize the potential of this technology to save them time and money and even help them develop game-changing products and services, so they're pouring investment into AI. And Nvidia, as the leading chip designer, is benefiting. This potential is further illustrated by forecasts calling for the AI market to reach into the trillions of dollars in a few years from now. Importantly, Nvidia isn't just about GPUs. The company has built an AI empire, creating software and networking tools, and it even aims to power the humanoid robots of tomorrow. This expansion is key to Nvidia's growth because it enables the company to benefit from every stage of AI development -- not just the early days of infrastructure ramp-up. Meanwhile, Nvidia has also put the focus on innovation to ensure it stays ahead of its rivals. It has pledged to update its chips yearly and has already offered investors visibility into planned launches over the coming three years.\u00a0Though rivals are carving out market share -- for example,Advanced Micro Devicesrecently reported a 57% increase in data center quarterly revenue -- Nvidia's innovation should keep it in the top spot. The enormous demand for AI means that others, like AMD, can succeed without truly encroaching on Nvidia's territory. The biggestdisappointment for Nvidiaand investors at this point (and possibly into the future) is the situation concerning exports to China. The U.S. has blocked chip exports, cutting Nvidia out of the market that represented 13% of its revenue last year. This isn't a non-event, and if the situation remains as is, it limits Nvidia's growth opportunities to some degree. The good news is that Nvidia makes most of its revenue in the U.S. and a great deal in other locations as well, so the export situation doesn't necessarily translate to slow growth for this chip giant. All this sounds positive, but why is Nvidia the bestMagnificent Sevenbuy for the second half? Nvidia remains the best overall AI bet due to its deep presence acrossevery stageof the technology's growth. The world's biggest tech companies turn to Nvidia to power their platforms, and that's unlikely to change, as these customers aim to use the fastest processors available -- and those are likely to have the name Nvidia on them well into the future. Nvidia will accompany these customers as they deploy AI agents within their businesses or develop humanoid robots down the road. At the same time, Nvidia's valuation leaves the stock plenty of room to run. Though it's inched higher in recent weeks, it still trades significantly lower than it did just a few months ago, at 36 timesforward earnings estimatescompared to more than 50 times. All these elements, from Nvidia's presence across AI to its price today, support my prediction that this stock will roar higher in the second half and over the long run, too.",

        "content": "The investing community is beginning to take notice ofNebius Group(NBIS-1.45%). I say that largely based on the almost 150% surge in its share price since mid-April. There's a reason behind that, though. Nebius has been executing on its plan to grow its revenues to a level that would justify a valuation well above its current one. The company, which went public in May 2011 under the name Yandex, was originally a Russian search engine company. The stock peaked in late 2021. It now trades as Amsterdam-based Nebius Group more than 40% off that previous high. Nebius sprouted as the cloud computing arm of Russian e-services giant Yandex. It was formed after Yandex restructured and divested all of its Russian assets in July 2024. It resumed trading on theNasdaqStock Exchangeunder the Nebius name in late October 2024. Image source: Getty Images. The stock remains far below its Yandex-era highs since the post-transition business has yet to fully demonstrate its potential for growing revenue. But Nebius management is giving investors a good idea of how to value that expected growth. If its assessment proves accurate, Nebius stock would be a good buy at recent prices. Nebius' core business is cloud infrastructure. It's one of a growing number of hyperscalers supplying the computing power needed in theage of artificial intelligence (AI). Hyperscalers like Nebius have the massive amounts of data center infrastructure that it takes to supply cloud computing services on a global level. It competes with leading players likeAmazonWeb Services (AWS),MicrosoftAzure, andAlphabet's Google Cloud. While its cloud infrastructure and services segment is Nebius' core business, the company has four business segments, all in specific areas of the AI ecosystem: Nebius (cloud infrastructure):The core business, providing infrastructure from a network of data centers for AI workloads, including large-scale GPU clusters, cloud platforms, and developer tools. Toloka:A data partner with a network of human specialists to test and evaluatelarge language models (LLMs)in generative AI development. TripleTen:A technology platform focused on reskilling individuals for tech careers, leveraging AI-driven educational tools. Avride:Developing autonomous driving technology forself-driving carsand delivery robots, targeting sectors like ride-hailing, logistics, e-commerce, and food delivery. Nebius' work in the AI ecosystem has attracted the attention of AI leaderNvidia. The chipmaker participated in a $700 million private funding round for Nebius late last year. Nvidia also owns more than 1 million shares of Nebius stock. Nebius is leading the way in providing computing capacity from Nvidia's GB200 Blackwell Superchips to European customers. The GB200 is a key component in the architecture of Nvidia CPU and GPU liquid-cooled server racks, including networking links forAI model inference. Nebius' partnership with Nvidia gives the cloud services company the ability to scale at a rate that management says will result in an annualized revenue run rate of between $750 million and $1 billion by the end of 2025. It also expects to reach positiveadjusted EBITDA(earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) this year. The upper end of that revenue run rate would give Nebius aprice-to-sales (P/S) ratioof about 12.5, even after the stock's recent surge. That appears to be a reasonable valuation for such a fast-growing tech company. By comparison, fellow cloud AI infrastructure providerCoreWeavesports a P/S ratio of about 15 based on this year's revenue guidance. Nebius may now be showing up on some tech investors' radars, but it still isn't being valued as richly as it could be. If Nebius does achieve the sales growth management says it's on track to reach this year, the stock could have more room to run over both the short and long term.",

        "content": "Today, Americans spend $9,985 on average on food per year\u2014making it one of the largest expenses overall. As U.S. food prices have jumped 23.6% in the past five years, meal prepping can be a valuable way to cut costs.Done right, meal prepping can reduce food away from home expenses, limit food waste, andhelp you avoid last-minute grocery splurges. It'll also save you thousands of dollars annually. We\u2019ll show you the potential cost savings of meal prepping along with expert tips forplanning meals that fit your budget and lifestyle. Meal prepping can save you thousands of dollars each year. Let\u2019s say you spend on average $95 per week on food away from home, with the average meal costing $20. In comparison, meal prepping can cost you $4 per meal, with a weekly total of $20 across five meals. This results in $75 in savings per week ($95 - $20 = $75) and $3,900 in savings a year ($75 X 52 = $3,900) on meal prepping alone. Assuming you get food away from home on occasion (say $30 a week versus $95) you can still save around $2,340 annually. \u201cWhen I started meal prepping, I wasspending about $100 a week on groceries, but after refining my shopping and prepping process and finding staple recipes I loved, I got it down to about $40 per week,\u201d saysNick Quintero, owner of meal prepping platform Workweek Lunch. \u201cThat\u2019s a $3,000-per-year savings.\u201d Importantly, meal prepping depends on a number of factors, including ingredient prices and the size of portions, but using key strategies, includingstocking up on staples, buying in bulk, andembracing coupons, can make a meaningful difference to your budget. To maximize your savings, consider the following tips to make meal prepping sustainable over time. This will prevent impulse buys at the grocery store and ordering food away from home at the last minute. Start by choosing a dedicated day for meal prepping. Then, plan recipes that can last you the week to most efficiently stretch a meal. When you\u2019re buying ingredients, considerpurchasing in bulkandusing coupons. Then, stick to this routine to build a lasting habit. In 2025, U.S. food prices are projected to increase by 2.9%, with eggs rising by 39.2% and beef increasing by 6.6%. A key step to meal prepping is stocking your kitchen with convenient, versatile, and long-lasting staple ingredients. \u201cHaving well-stocked cupboard essentials is always an amazing way to start when it comes down toreducing your spending,\u201d says Mimi Harrison, author of Beat the Budget. \u201cFor example, some of my favorite pasta sauces are made with tomato puree as the foundational ingredient (spicy arrabiatta, a vodka pasta sauce, etc). This costs $0.80 cents and can be used across around 6-8 servings.\u201d Going further, the benefit of staple ingredients is that they can be used for a number of different meals. \u201cI swear by staples like pasta, rice, quinoa, and canned beans. They\u2019re super cheap, last forever, and I can whip up grain bowls, soups, or salads with them,\u201d says Quintero. Harrison also recommends having dried basil, oregano, parsley, smoked paprika, and cumin on hand when it comes to dried herbs and spices. Among the most efficient ways to save you time is to stock the freezer. In this way, you have meals ready to go in the future, or whenever you\u2019re in a pinch. \u201cIn my freezer, you\u2019ll always find chicken, frozen fruit and veggies, and meal-prepped spaghetti sauce. These are my lifesaver items when fresh produce gets pricey,\u201d says Quintero. Additionally, having a stash of diverse meals in the freezer can go a long way. \u201cTo ensure that I don\u2019t get bored, I implement what I call a \u2018freezer cycle,\u2019 which is where I freeze individual portions using a rotating system, \u201c says Harrison. \u201cI\u2019m therefore never having the same dinner three days in a row, which is where I think you can hit a roadblock, give up, and limit your savings.\u201d With the right planning and consistent effort, meal prepping can save you significant change each week, which adds up to thousands annually. \u201cThe thing most people get hung up on is not giving the process enough time to work,\u201d says Quintero. \u201cYou have to be intentional with your time and understand that you\u2019re teaching yourself a new life skill.\u201d",

        "content": "Investing.com-- Here is your Pro Recap of the top takeaways from Wall Street analysts for the past week. InvestingProsubscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today! AMD What happened?On Monday, Melius upgraded on AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) at Buy with a $175.00 price target. *TLDR: AMD\u2019s Middle East partnerships fuel growth. GPU sales surge signals strong future. What\u2019s the full story?Melius sees AMD\u2019s recent Sovereign partnerships as a strategic tailwind. Collaborations with Saudi Arabia\u2019s HUMAIN and the UAE\u2019s G42 underscore AMD\u2019s growing influence in the Middle East, where its share could outpace its global presence. HUMAIN\u2019s $10 billion commitment, targeting up to 6GW of data center capacity by 2034, and G42\u2019s early adoption of AMD GPUs highlight immense regional growth potential. Each gigawatt represents a multi-billion-dollar opportunity, even if Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) dominates the broader market. These partnerships position AMD as a key player in a rapidly expanding sector. The firm is significantly raising estimates for AMD\u2019s GPU sales, driven by advancements like the MI355, which offers a 35x boost in low latency inference. Sales are projected to hit $6.6 billion in 2025, up from $6.0 billion, with further leaps to $9.7 billion in 2026 and $13.1 billion in 2027, fueled by rack-scale products with enhanced memory capabilities. A potential rebound in China could add $3 billion annually. By 2028, capturing just 5% of the accelerator market could push AMD\u2019s EPS above $9, reflecting its strengthening position in AI and high-performance computing. AMD\u2019s runway is robust, and Melius believes the firm is poised for sustained growth. Lyft What happened?On Tuesday, TD Cowen upgraded Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT) to Buy with a $21 price target. *TLDR: Lyft bets on growth levers. Market expansion drives gains. What\u2019s the full story?TD Cowen cranks up Lyft estimates, betting on growth levers as the broker hones in on management\u2019s laser-focused execution. The crew has pivoted to \u201ccustomer obsession,\u201d rolling out innovations like Price Lock to lock down rider loyalty while juicing driver incentives. Tier 2 cities\u2014think Charlotte, Indianapolis\u2014are exploding, with growth clocking 30% YoY in 1Q25, 2x Lyft\u2019s national pace. Improved supply-demand forecasting and driver perks are fueling the surge. Meanwhile, the FREENOW acquisition unlocks a \u20ac1B annual opportunity in Europe, while Canada flexes triple-digit growth in \u201924, tapering to a still-solid 50% YoY in 1Q25. Product innovation is king. Price Lock locks in predictable fares for riders and steady sub-revenue for Lyft. Partnerships, like DoorDash (NASDAQ:DASH), are driving active riders, with more collabs on the horizon. The US rideshare game? Still a 70/30 split between Uber (NYSE:UBER) and Lyft, with no material share shifts expected. But here\u2019s the kicker: Lyft doesn\u2019t need to steal Uber\u2019s lunch to win. The US rideshare market is set to grow ~10% CAGR \u201925-\u201930, and Lyft is poised to ride that wave. The broker sees the stock working\u2014no Uber conquest required. Duke Energy What happened?On Wednesday, Goldman Sachs upgraded Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK) to Buy with a $132 price target. *TLDR: Goldman bets on Duke\u2019s growth. Valuation, partnerships drive upside. What\u2019s the full story?Goldman upgrades Duke betting on its capex-driven growth, regulatory wins, and valuation edge. The firm sees DUK as a standout in regulated utilities, with a projected 5.5% capex growth CAGR through 2029, fueled by robust demand in the Carolinas. Duke\u2019s partnership with GE Vernova gives it a leg up in fast-tracking gas generation, securing 19 turbines to meet surging power needs. Regulatory tailwinds in the Carolinas and Florida, coupled with a $83 billion capex plan\u201445% for grid upgrades, 40% for new generation\u2014solidify Goldman\u2019s bullish stance. The firm highlights Duke\u2019s rare confidence in out-year capex, backed by accelerating load growth\u20143-4% by 2029 versus 1-2% earlier. While rivals face regulatory uncertainty, Duke\u2019s scale and GE partnership position it to pivot faster, cheaper. Beyond gas, Goldman flags Duke\u2019s nuclear ambitions, particularly small modular reactors, as a long-term play. In a sector starved for growth, Duke\u2019s all-of-the-above strategy makes it a premium utility with room to run. Unity Software What happened?On Thursday, BofA reinstated Unity Software (NYSE:U) at Underperform with a $15 price target. *TLDR: BofA downgrades Unity, sees little upside. Monetization struggles erode developer trust. What\u2019s the full story?BofA slams Unity with an Underperform rating and a $15 price target, unconvinced the company\u2019s game engine\u2014its Create segment\u2014can drive shareholder value through seat-based subscriptions. The firm doubts Unity\u2019s heavy investment in its engine will pay off via ads, despite powering 70% of mobile games. Only about 10% of developers cough up cash, a symptom of financial precariousness and short lifespans that deter casual game studios from shelling out for large user teams. Unity\u2019s gamble to tie revenue to content consumption blew up in its face, triggering developer outrage and forcing a retreat. Meanwhile, nearly every other engine BofA researched thrives on content sales or goes open-source, leaving Unity stranded in a no-man\u2019s-land of monetization. The analyst sees limited upside and a muddled path forward for a company whose once-dominant position now feels increasingly fragile Nike What happened?On Friday, HSBC upgraded Nike (NYSE:NKE) to Buy with a $80 price target. *TLDR: Nike rebounds under disciplined, consumer-focused leadership. HSBC upgrades, sees tangible recovery ahead. What\u2019s the full story?HSBC has observed Nike\u2019s journey with both skepticism and, more recently, growing optimism. The firm initially found the unwavering investor enthusiasm for Nike perplexing, especially given the missteps of the past four years. However, tangible evidence now suggests a credible path to sales recovery and margin improvement, even amid tariff headwinds. Inventory cleanup is nearing completion, and the brand\u2019s assortment is fresher and more compelling. Under the new leadership of CEO John Donahoe, HSBC sees a disciplined team focused on long-term quality, particularly in repositioning digital channels as premium, full-price avenues. Nike appears to be a battered leader undergoing a convincing reboot. Strategic errors in product focus and distribution have been corrected, with the firm returning to its core ethos: \u201cthe consumer decides.\u201d Early successes, such as strong holiday orders in North America and Europe, suggest the new approach is resonating. While a Buy rating on Nike aligns with broader sell-side consensus, it represents a notable shift for HSBC. The firm is raising its target price and estimates significantly, factoring in higher organic growth, a more favorable USD spot rate, and a revised outlook post-tariff adjustments. Nike\u2019s comeback is real, driven by a refreshed team acting with speed and experience.

We conclude that demand to train new models and consumer inference workload growth on the back of ChatGPT\u2019s popularity and the continued rollout of various products from Meta, Google, and Amazon should sustain GPU demand for years to come. This should, in turn, drive demand for cloud infrastructure, hardware and other technology that gets pulled along with this compute.\u201d A team of professional financial investors in a modern office analyzing Investment opportunities. While the firm believes that the enterprise adoption pillar is most at risk due to slower adoption, a more uncertain investment return, and the specific configuration is necessary to adapt AI to individual needs. These risks are nevertheless manageable. The firm then highlighted stocks such as Nvidia and Broadcom to own in the space. \u201cIn terms of stock calls on the back of this demand analysis, we remain bullish on NVDA and would also highlight AVGO as key Tier 1 beneficiaries of compute and networking demand, and would also highlight MU as a peripheral beneficiary of increased memory requirements. Globally, we would also highlight TSMC.\u201d Broadcom is a technology company uniquely positioned in the AI revolution owing to its custom chip offerings and networking assets. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

        "content": "(Reuters) -Nvidia insiders sold over $1 billion worth of company stock in the past year, with a notable uptick in recent trading activity as executives capitalize on surging investor interest in artificial intelligence, the Financial Times reported on Sunday. More than $500 million of the share sales took place this month as the California-based chip designer's share price climbed to an all-time high, the report said. Jensen Huang, Nvidia's chief executive, started selling shares this week for the first time since September, the SEC filing showed. Nvidia's stock hit a record on Wednesday, and the chipmaker reclaimed the crown as the world's most valuable company after an analyst said the chipmaker was set to ride a \"Golden Wave\" of artificial intelligence. Its latest gains reflect the U.S. stock market's return to the \"AI trade\" that fueled massive gains in chip stocks and related technology companies in recent years on optimism about the emerging technology. Nvidia declined to comment on the FT report. Reuters could not immediately confirm the report. Nvidia's shares have rebounded over 60% from their closing low on April 4, when Wall Street was reeling from President Donald Trump's global tariff announcements. U.S. stocks, including Nvidia, have recovered on expectations the White House will reach trade deals to soften the tariffs.

        "content": "JINHUA, CHINA - OCTOBER 25: Automated robotic arms work on the assembly line of new energy vehicles ... More at a factory of Chinese EV startup Leapmotor on October 25, 2023 in Jinhua, Zhejiang Province of China. (Photo by Hu Xiaofei/VCG via Getty Images)VCG via Getty Images Cyngn (NASDAQ:CYN) stock has surged over 300% in just two trading days after AI chip titan Nvidia named the company in a blog post as one of a select group of robotics innovators using its Isaac robotics platform to build autonomous industrial vehicles. Cyngn specializes in autonomous vehicle technology tailored for industrial and logistics applications. Isaac is Nvidia\u2019s robotics platform that combines AI models for perception, reasoning, and control, serving as an open foundation model for robotic skills and decision-making. Cyngn\u2019s flagship product, DriveMod, retrofits existing industrial vehicles such as forklifts, turning them into autonomous machines.   The announcement from Nvidia comes ahead of Automatica 2025, a major global automation and robotics event where Cyngn is set to showcase its latest technologies. Cyngn\u2019s vehicles, which integrate Nvidia\u2019s Isaac platform with its own DriveMod software, are already operating in live commercial environments, catering to customers in logistics, manufacturing, and automotive sectors. Although these tools could play an increasing role in streamlining operations and reducing labor costs, investors should be cautious when it comes to Cyngn\u2019s stock. But, if you are looking for an upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception.  Cyngn Is Still A Risky Bet Cyngn is still in the early stages of commercialization, with Q1 revenue of a mere $47,200, despite strong growth from a small base. Revenue volatility remains a concern. Over the past year, sales actually declined by 34.1%, falling from $0.6 million to $0.4 million, while the broader S&P 500 saw average revenue growth of 5.5%. Cyngn also posted a net loss of $7.6 million in Q1, reflecting continued heavy investment in R&D and scaling up its operations.   The company recently announced a $15 million direct offering at $5.01 per share, providing additional capital but also diluting existing shareholders. With a high cash burn rate, Cyngn may need to raise more funds in the future. Valuation is also stretched. Cyngn trades at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 43.5, compared to 3.1 for the S&P 500. It\u2019s also worth noting that the recent rally was sparked largely by Nvidia\u2019s mention, not an exclusive partnership or contract. Cyngn is one of more than ten companies featured in Nvidia\u2019s blog post, and likely just one of many that will leverage Isaac moving forward. With limited revenue, significant losses, and a recent share issuance, the rally appears driven more by speculation, rather than business fundamentals. (Related: QuantumScape: 40x Upside For QS Stock?)  While you would do well to be cautious about CYN stock for now, you could explore the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you cansign upto receive in your inbox every morning along with: The chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings I have spent the entire week live onOpening Biddiscussing tech. Nvidia's (NVDA)record-high stock price. Circle's (CRCL) exploding \u2014 then plunging \u2014stock price. Micron's (MU) surprisingly strong quarter, coming a day after FedEx's (FDX) limp quarter suggested economic weakness ahead. The potential of a new tech bubble as traders pile into the July 30 rate cut from the Federal Reserve narrative. But all week long, I didn't mention a single social media name. No Meta (META). No Snap (SNAP). No Reddit (RDDT). I should've mentioned Reddit, however. While the stock is playing its part in the major jump in tech stocks the past month (+37%), shares are still down 14% year to date amid fears that Google's AI initiatives will drive traffic away from Reddit content. After talking with experts this past week and earlier at theCannes Lions conference, I think the relative underperformance of Reddit's stock versus the market is overdone. \"Reddit is at the epicenter of disruptive finance and a major player in the years ahead,\" Wedbush tech analystDan Ivestold me. The company has greatly improved the content quality on its platform, attracting advertisers' interest. It's also making a large investment in AI-powered search to serve up more relevant content. Reddit COO Jen Wong told me at Cannes Lions (video above) that the company is all in on AI. \"Reddit is a lot of conversation in words, so AI allows us to machine translate global conversations into multiple languages, and we're doing this today in French and German, in fact, and in almost 12 different languages,\" Wong said. \"And these are conversations that are about universal life experiences, like parenting or pop culture.\" The company is defending its business against AI chatbot startup and web scraper Anthropic (and others of its ilk). That could have a positive outcome for the business. \"What's important to us is that we are able to protect our users' privacy, their deletion rights, like we have policies that ensure that when users take down a post, the post is taken down,\" Wong said. \"And so it's really important, and as we've said in our terms of service, that we have a conversation with folks who have access to our data because that's a commitment that we have in terms of our policies, and it's also to know how Reddit data is used.\" Redditfiled a new lawsuitearlier this month claiming that Anthropic intentionally scraped its users' personal data without their consent. Anthropic then allegedly used that data to train its large language model Claude. On the other hand, content publishers such as Reddit continue to face challenges in the AI age. Big Tech has been forking over cash for licensing agreements to use publishers' archives to train large language models. The New York Times (NYT) recently inked a multiyear deal to license content to Amazon (AMZN) for AI-related uses, marking its first generative AI contract. In 2023, the company sued OpenAI and Microsoft (MSFT), alleging the tech companies illegally used millions of its articles to train chatbots. News Corp. (NWS), owner of the Wall Street Journal, signed a five-year licensing deal with OpenAI in May 2024 worth a reported $250 million. For its part, Reddit struck a deal with Google (GOOG,GOOGL) in 2024 that allows the search giant to use posts from its site to train its AI models. The arrangement was reported to be worth $60 million. It also signed a similar deal with OpenAI in 2024. I fancy more of these are coming later this year due to the value of Reddit's human-generated content. Anthropic will probably end up paying up too. Wall Street is taking notice of the Reddit story. Two sell-side analyst notes caught my attention this week: \"Overall, we come away with the view that Reddit has a viable strategy to reduce the current top-of-funnel user volatility ... we have a greater appreciation of the durability of current revenue growth given the strong ARPU (average revenue per user) tailwinds and the fact that the vast amount of monetization currently comes from logged-in users which are showing far less volatility,\" Deutsche Bank analyst Benjamin Black wrote. \"Moreover, the company remains front-footed on product, rolling out Dynamic Shopping Ads this quarter, refining Reddit Answers, in addition to working on a growing suite of automation tools.\" \"As an aside, Reddit came up in most of our conversations with marketers, brands, and agencies suggesting significant growth in awareness amongst this community. The net/net here, we come away from our meeting incrementally positive on shares of Reddit,\" Citi analyst Ron Josey wrote. I won't sit here and blow smoke that Reddit's stock is cheap from a valuation perspective. Shares trade on a forward P/E multiple of 113 times,according to Yahoo Finance data. However, if the market is going to strongly embrace high-multiple tech names again (as seen currently), then Reddit could be worth a look. The company is growing its top and bottom lines by double digits, isn't weighed down by money-losing hardware businesses like Meta, and is crushing Snap in terms of execution. Those are things you can get behind, provided you are bullish on tech. Brian Sozziis Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor and a member of Yahoo Finance's editorial leadership team.

        "header": "Prediction: This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Could Be the Next Nvidia -- and It's Not What You Think",
        "content": "Since OpenAI released ChatGPT to the world on Nov. 30, 2022, shares of semiconductor powerhouseNvidia(NVDA1.74%)have risen by 818% (as of June 26). To put that another way, over the last two and a half years, Nvidia's market capitalization went from $345 billion to $3.8 trillion. making it thelargest company in the worldas measured by market cap. Some investors are already thinking about who the next breakout candidate in the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution will be, with signs pointing to another chip stock -- perhapsAdvanced Micro Devices? What aboutBroadcomorTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing? While each of these companies stands to benefit from rising AI infrastructure spend over the next several years, I see another business that is better positioned as \"the next Nvidia.\" You see,Meta Platforms(META1.04%)has been investing in AI over the last couple of years, and the technologies it's developing could transform Meta's social media empire and position the stock for superior gains over the competition. Image source: Getty Images. Meta operates across two core segments: advertising and Reality Labs. Reality Labs represents Meta's metaverse ambitions, which include virtual reality interactions, gaming, and consumer wearables. While Reality Labs stands to benefit from AI, this segment of the company remains unprofitable and is more of a longer-term vision to turn Meta into something beyond just a social media platform. The main source of revenue and profits for Meta comes from advertising -- specifically, ads that appear across the company's social media platforms: Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. It's this area of the business that is ripe for disruption thanks to the power of AI. If you have ever scrolled on any of Meta's social media apps, chances are that you've been bombarded with a series of advertisements. However, how many of those ads actually appealed to you? As sophisticated as Meta's user algorithms have been in the past, my hunch is that you still receive postings or notifications for content, goods, and services that aren't of high interest to you. By leveraging AI, however, Meta can improve its data workloads as it relates to user engagement and consumer behaviors. As a result, the company can improve its predictive analytics to better position more relevant and customized listings for its users. In turn, advertisers, which can be somewhat unpredictable and exhibit cyclical budgeting strategies, will bemore inclined to allocate funds across Meta's various platforms. By keeping advertisers sticky to the ecosystem, Meta has an opportunity to employpricing powerover the competition and accelerate its revenue growth. At the same time, improving ad feeds for its users can also help Meta from a cost structure perspective -- as the unit economics on clicks and customer acquisition should become lower over time. The combination of accelerating revenue and lower costs could result in meaningful profit margin expansion for Meta in the long run. Since ChatGPT's release, the share prices of Meta have gained more than 500%. I bring this up to make it clear that Meta has also benefited from the bullish AI trade over the last couple of years.  Data byYCharts. However, except for a notable spike during the first half of 2023, Meta'sprice-to-earnings(P/E) multiple has remained fairly consistent over the last 18 months or so. These dynamics suggest a couple of ideas. First, the relative normalization in Meta's P/E could imply that investors think the company's earnings profile is maturing. In addition, while a P/E of 28 isn't exactly dirt cheap, this valuation is clearly a steep discount based on prior levels. Meta is positioning itself for a meaningful boost in profitability as AI becomes more integrated throughout its ecosystem. For this reason,Meta's valuation multiples could expandin the coming years as the company's \"Nvidia moment\" comes into focus. That suggests the company has meaningful upside from current levels. I think Meta is a no-brainer when it comes to megacap AI stocks. The valuation analysis explored above suggests that Meta stock still trades at a reasonable price point despite an already generous return throughout the AI revolution. Moreover, I think the company is still in the early stages of its AI development, and investors have yet to see the full potential these investments could yield for Meta in the long run.",

Nvidia(NVDA1.74%)is asemiconductorstalwart that pioneered the development of thegraphics processing unit(GPU). Invaluable for AI applications, GPUs are also critical components found in data centers, where AI computing occurs. The company consistently generates strongfree cash flow-- just one of many reasons whyNvidia stockis a must-consider for any investor looking to gain AI exposure. Theparent company of numerous businesses,Alphabet(GOOG2.30%)(GOOGL2.70%)incorporates itslarge language model(LLM) chatbot,Gemini, into offerings like Google Search and Android phones. Other companies also integrate Gemini into their products, like visual messaging providerSnapand strategy and consulting leaderAccenture. Besides Gemini, Alphabet provides extensive AI exposure through itscloud computing service, Google Cloud. Expanding beyond the software offerings that initially made it famous,Microsoft(MSFT-0.28%)offers AI exposure through its generative AI chatbot, Copilot, found in several Microsoft products like Microsoft 365. Investors also gain AI exposure through the company's cloud computing platform, Microsoft Azure. Microsoft also provides indirect AI exposure as the company is amajor investor in OpenAI, the owner ofChatGPT. Meta Platforms(META1.04%)may be most recognizable as the parent company of Facebook, but the company emerged as a leader in AI tools after developing Meta AI, an AI-powered assistant that's integrated in otherMeta appsand built on the Llama LLM. In June 2025, Meta broadened its AI reach with a $14.3 billion investment in Scale AI, a company pursuingartificial general intelligence. Like Nvidia,Broadcom(AVGO-0.30%)is another leading semiconductor stock that has close ties to the AI industry. Data center growth is contributing to strong demand for Broadcom's AI accelerators. ForQ2 2025, Broadcom reported over $4.4 billion in AI semiconductor revenue, a 46% year-over-year increase. AI networking represented 40% of AI revenue, a 70% year-over-year gain. Once upon a time,Amazon(AMZN2.66%)was merely a bookseller. Today, however, it has a robust cloud computing business. Launched almost 20 years ago,Amazon Web Serviceshas emerged as a premier cloud computing option, providing the foundation for companies to develop their own AI resources as well as AI services and tools like Amazon Bedrock and Amazon SageMaker. At the end of 2024, AWS achieved a $115 annualized revenuerun rate. For context, Amazon reported total revenue of $638 billion for 2024. Considering its scale and its dedication to innovation, Amazon is sure to remain a premier AI force for years to come. From assisting customers with data integration, to security and compliance, to healthcare advances, to supporting the militaries of the U.S. and allies, software companyPalantir Technologies(PLTR-9.04%)developed a sophisticated platform for analyzing large datasets. In strong financial health, Palantir is consistently profitable and ended the first quarter 2025 with $5.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents with no debt. Plus, it routinely generates strong free cash flow. With its Dedicated IC Foundry business model,TaiwanSemiconductorManufacturing(TSM2.02%)produces semiconductors for customers instead of original semiconductors for itself. Nvidia, for example, is a Taiwan Semiconductor customer, turning to it for help in production of theBlackwell GPU, which is used in AI applications. Illustrating its strong exposure to AI, Taiwan Semiconductor stated that 2024 revenue from AI accelerators represented \"close to mid-teens percent\" of its total revenue. Most recognizeTesla(TSLA-0.67%)for itselectric vehicles(EVs) but its leadership in AI warrants recognition. For one, the company's EVs have sophisticated autonomous driving capability -- capability that's only expected to increase -- and it's making steady progress in advancing itsrobotaxi business. Tesla reported about $5 billion in 2024 AI-related capital expenditures, and it expects about the same in 2025. Considering Elon Musk's enthusiasm for AI, it would be unsurprising if Musk moves toward a Tesla acquisition of his AIstart-up, xAI. Providing infrastructure for AI computing,CoreWeave(CRWV1.21%)developed a cloud platform to support AI's high computing demands. The allure of its technology is highlighted by its recent $11.9 billion deal with OpenAI to develop AI infrastructure. CoreWeave is in rapid growth mode. In Q1 2025, it reported revenue of $982 million, a year-over-year increase of 420% resulting from high demand for the company's cloud platform.",

        "content": "Manyartificial intelligence (AI) stockshave had a rough start in 2025. Developments such as DeepSeek's breakthrough in low-cost AI modeling, as well as tariff and geopolitical concerns, weighed on these stocks. Interestingly, President Donald Trump's \"Liberation Day\" announcement signaled a low for many AI stocks, so much so that some of them have eked out a net gain for the year to date. Additionally, some AI stocks are poised to continue moving higher, and the three stocks below should continue to surge despite recent gains. Image source: Getty Images. Will Healy(Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing):Chip manufacturerTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(TSMC)(TSM2.02%)finds itself at the center of its industry and the geopolitical turmoil that has weighed on many AI stocks. TSMC claims just over two-thirds of the foundry market, and top chip companies such asNvidia(NVDA1.74%),Apple, andBroadcomare among its customers. Moreover, China is a critical customer of many of its clients. Still, that country remains an ongoing threat to the sovereignty of Taiwan, which is home to TSMC's headquarters and the majority of its chip production capacity. That weighed on the stock as trade-war tensions came to a head in early April. Despite that drop, the stock has staged a dramatic recovery since then, so much so that it is nowup14% so far this year. Furthermore, TSMC's revenue growth and valuation could mean the stock is at the beginning of a bull market. As customers scramble to adoptgenerative AI, demand for AI chips has skyrocketed. In the first quarter of 2025, revenue of $25.5 billion increased 42% from year-ago levels. Also, since TSMC kept operating expense growth in check, its net income surged 60% higher to $11 billion. Additionally, the company forecasts second-quarter revenue between $28.4 billion and $29.2 billion, amounting to 38% growth at the midpoint, indicating that its massive growth is on track to continue. Amid the fears of a takeover, TSMC sells at a P/E ratio of 29. Although investors should not dismiss such worries, China's dependence on the company's chips reduces the likelihood of such a geopolitical event. It also probably means the stock is a bargain, and as rising chip demand continues to drive revenue, TSMC stock is likely to rise along with that trend. Justin Pope(Nvidia):The world's dominant AI data center chip company isn't a flashy pick, but it seems likely that Nvidia, which fell 30% by late April, then rallied back to new all-time highs and a 16% gain year to date, will continue to shine through the rest of the the year. Despite Nvidia's staggering investment returns over the past few years, the equally impressive growth in the underlying business has continued to sustain a reasonable valuation, leaving room for the stock to continue its upward journey. The company's annual revenue has increased from $27 billion in its fiscal year 2023 to $130 billion in its fiscal year 2025. Chips used in AI data centers have become Nvidia's core business. The good news? It appears that AI will drive significant investments in data centers for the foreseeable future. Research by Dell'Oro Group estimates that annual global data center expenditures could grow by 21% annually, surpassing $1 trillion by 2029. At the very least, there are no apparent near-term signs of a pullback in AI investments. Analysts anticipate Nvidia's full-year revenue will reach $200 billion this fiscal year and $250 billion next year. Meanwhile, analysts estimate Nvidia will grow its earnings by nearly 29% annually over the next three to five years. The stock trades at aprice-to-earnings (P/E) ratioof 50 today. That's a steep valuation for most stocks, but investors can probably make an exception for Nvidia. Its strong business momentum, leadership in AI data center chips, and a strong forecast for continued growth in data center expenditures combine to make the stock a buy at these levels, paving the way for continued gains through the coming months. Jake Lerch(Advanced Micro Devices):My choice isAdvanced Micro Devices(AMD0.05%). As of this writing, shares of AMD have advanced 19% this year, representing a real bounceback for a stock that declined by 63% between February 2024 and April 2025. The company, which designs microprocessors, is at the forefront of the AIrevolution,thanks to its new series of GPUs, which now compete withNvidia's lineup of AI chips. There are reports that some shipments of Nvidia AI chips, including its top-of-the-line Blackwell unit, have been delayed, which might provide a further opportunity for AMD. AMD already has its MI300X unit available for sale and plans to launch two additional AI units (MI350 and MI400) within the next year and a half. What's more,sell-side analystsare expectingAMD's sales to pick up as it rolls out these new lines of AI chips.According to consensus estimates compiled by Yahoo! Finance, AMD should generate $31.8 billion in sales in 2025 and $37.4 billion in 2026, representing year-over-year growth of 23% and 18%, respectively. Moreover, as AMD ramps up sales of its AI chips, the company's gross margin is widening.As of its most recent quarter (for the three months ending on March 29, 2025), AMD's gross margin stood at 50%, up from 42% in late 2022.While the company's margin remains far behind Nvidia--which has a gross margin of 61%,AMD has narrowed the gap considerably over the last year. To sum up, AMD is on a roll. Its stock is soaring for the first time in more than a year, it has plans to deliver new, cutting-edge products, and analysts expect its sales to surge over the next 12 to 24 months. Investors looking for an AI stock positioned to move higher should strongly consider AMDright now.",

        "content": "With stocks reaching a new high just as the midpoint of the year is reached, it is an opportune time ... More to look at what the second half of the year might hold. As the tariff threat eased and some progress was made on trade agreements, stocks have recovered sharply. The boost from technology and artificial intelligence-related companies was also notably in the rebound.getty With stocks reaching a new high just as the midpoint of the year is reached, it is an opportune time to look at what the second half of the year might hold. Rather than the traditional outlook, this will be an examination of the risks versus rewards, considering what is currently priced in financial markets.   One Chart Tells The Stock Story The massive US tariffs announced on Liberation Day sent the betting odds of recession soaring to 65%, with stocks dragged lower in expectation of lower earnings. As the tariff threat eased and some progress was made on trade agreements, stocks have recovered sharply. The recent 12-day military conflict between Israel and Iran caused concerns about an economically unfriendly oil shock. Still, the US bombing of Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities has led to a ceasefire, which has cooled fears. Stocks & Recession OddsGlenview Trust, Bloomberg  The betting odds of recession also tell much of the story about the US 10-year Treasury note yield. Yields fell as fears of an economic downturn rose and have since recovered from the lows, as economic risk appears to have waned. There is more to the story here, as signs suggest that bond markets worldwide are less willing to fund the unfavorable fiscal situations of most countries. Yields & Recession OddsGlenview Trust, Bloomberg  Recent Market Performance Stocks soared last week on the ceasefire in the Israel-Iran war and the agreement around a framework for US-China trade. The S&P 500 surpassed its mid-February high by 0.5% after having declined by almost 20%. The Magnificent 7, comprising Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has recovered to only 4% below its mid-December level after being as much as 30% under the peak.  Apart from the good news on trade and Iran, the strength in US bank stocks was notable. Last week, the annual Federal Reserve (Fed) stress tests for large banks were better than expected. Additionally, the Fed made some changes to the methodology, which are expected to result in fewer Stress Capital Buffers (SCBs) being required for banks in the future. All other things being equal, less need for capital buffers means better profitability. Market ReturnsGlenview Trust, Bloomberg   MORE FOR YOU Economic Risk The more economically sensitive cyclical stocks have outperformed less economically impacted defensives since stocks bottomed, marking the peak of recession fears. The current situation is back to pricing in a benign, if not downright optimistic, economic backdrop.Economically-Sensitive Versus Defensive StocksGlenview Trust, Bloomberg US Stock Valuations Based on the current 24.3 times current earnings and 23.4 times multiple of 2025 estimated earnings, also known as the forward price-to-earnings ratio, stocks do not look cheap relative to the past. However, historically, the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio has been correlated with return-on-equity (ROE), which measures how efficiently companies generate profits from the capital provided by their shareholders. Although the ROE is down from its recent highs, it remains above average, which argues for an above-average P/E ratio, assuming this elevated ROE is sustainable. Consensus estimates project a return on equity of 18.6% in 2025 and 19.4% in 2026, up from 17.6% in 2024. To provide perspective, the S&P 500\u2019s ROE was 15.1% in 2019 before the pandemic.S&P 500: Price-To-Earnings & ROEGlenview Trust, Bloomberg The composition of the large-cap US stock market is crucial to this improved outlook for ROE since much of the boost has come from technology and artificial intelligence-related companies. Even a simple analysis of the S&P 500 shows that at least 43% of the market capitalization is related to these two areas.Weights In S&P 500Glenview Trust, Bloomberg As noted earlier, the exceptional return on equity supports the rich stock valuations, and profit margins are elevated relative to historical levels. Profit margins measure the percentage of top-line sales that are converted into bottom-line profits. As a business owner, higher profit margins, all other things being equal, are more valuable. Notably, the profit margins for the technology sector are almost twice the market. In addition, according to FactSet, technology sector earnings are expected to grow at 18% in 2025, while the S&P 500\u2019s earnings are forecast to rise by about 9.1% year-over-year.S&P 500: ProfitabilityGlenview Trust, Bloomberg Free Cash Flow Matters According to Warren Buffett, \u201cThe value of a business is the cash it\u2019s going to produce in the future, discounted back to the present.\u201d Free cash flow measures the cash left over after a company supports its operations and maintains or invests further in its business. Thus, free cash flow provides a good measure of the money accruing to shareholders as owners. The free cash flow yield is calculated by dividing the free cash flow by the stock price. Consistent with the price-to-earnings ratio, the cash flow yield suggests that the stock market is not currently cheap, although it has been more expensive at times in the past. This metric assumes that free cash flow remains static, so it can also be interpreted as indicating that investors have more confidence that free cash flow will continue to grow. Indeed, investors should be willing to pay more for a company in which one can have high confidence that the corporate profits accruing to owners will continue to grow. As a subset of the S&P 500, technology stocks are priced at an even lower free cash flow yield. This valuation premium reflects the optimism about the future of many of these companies and the superior fundamentals of the group as a whole. The profit margins and earnings growth rate for the technology sector have been exceptional, which helps explain the premium valuation assigned by the lower free cash flow yield. One additional wrinkle is the massive capital spending (capex) that Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) are investing in artificial intelligence infrastructure. This spending is also depressing the current free cash flow yield for the technology-related stocks on the margin. Massive capital expenditure (capex) spending is often viewed as a red flag for investors, who are typically concerned that the substantial investment will not yield a sufficient return for the companies. However, these four companies are currently being given the benefit of the doubt.S&P 500: Free Cash Flow YieldGlenview Trust, Bloomberg What To Watch This Week The main event of the holiday-shortened trading week will be the monthly jobs report on Thursday. Economists expect June\u2019s gain in nonfarm payrolls to slow to 113,000 from 139,000 in May. Notably, the unemployment rate is expected to rise to 4.3% from 4.2%.US Unemployment RateGlenview Trust, Bloomberg Given the upward trend in weekly continuing claims for unemployment benefits, the expected uptick in unemployment is a reasonable assumption. The upward trend indicates that the job market has been softening as it is taking longer for those losing their jobs to get a new one. With expectations for the US economy rebounding and the risk of recession decreasing, the resilience of the labor market should be closely monitored.Continuing Claims For Unemployment BenefitsGlenview Trust, Bloomberg Federal Reserve Markets currently expect at least two 25-basis-point (0.25%) Fed cuts in 2025, consistent with the median Fed projection. There is a slight chance of a cut in July, but the first move lower in 2025 is fully priced for September.Fed Rate Cuts ExpectedGlenview Trust, Bloomberg Conclusions In the wake of the rebound from the tariff-induced bear market decline in stocks, investors should revisit their risk tolerance, as the robust stock rally over the last couple of years has likely increased their allocation to risk assets. Rebalancing stock and bond allocations toward the target risk level is wise for many investors, especially given the ongoing presence of tariff, geopolitical, and fiscal risks. The key to successful long-term stock investing is staying invested during the inevitable tough times, as rebounds from those bear markets are typically massive and unpredictable in timing, as illustrated by the first half of this year. Stocks are priced for a benign economic outcome and some support from the Federal Reserve in lowering interest rates. Improving corporate profitability, with 9% earnings growth in 2025 and 14% in 2026, is forecasted to normalize currently elevated valuations. This outcome is certainly possible, if not the most probable, but investors should be mindful that the hurdles at these valuation levels are higher. The artificial intelligence wave is a real phenomenon as adoption continues, so the optimistic scenario is not entirely out of the realm of possibility. This optimism should be tempered by the fact that the economy and earnings can always disappoint, especially if the trade war heats up again; therefore, investors should be prepared for possible turbulence.

        "content": "CHONGQING, CHINA - JUNE 16: A double-level Nike store is seen inside a shopping mall on June 16, ... More 2025 in Chongqing, China.  (Photo by Cheng Xin/Getty Images)Getty Images Nike (NYSE: NKE) stock has increased by over 20% in the past five days; however, it still remains down 5% year-to-date, trailing the S&P 500\u2019s 4% rise. The company disclosed fourth-quarter earnings that exceeded expectations \u2014 revenue fell by 12% to $11.1 billion, surpassing analyst estimates. Net income dropped 86% to $211 million, or $0.14 per share, compared to $1.5 billion ($0.99 per share) the previous year\u2014but still outperformed predictions. Investors harbor a sense of cautious optimism that the most challenging times may be behind the sportswear titan as it navigates through a tough turnaround. However, if you\u2019re seeking an upside with a smoother experience than picking an individual stock, you might want to consider the High Quality Portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception. Also, check out \u2013 Cyngn Stock: Should You Buy The Nvidia Hype?   A Tough Year in the Rearview For fiscal 2025, Nike reported total revenue of $46.3 billion, a 10% decline, and net income of $3.2 billion, representing a 44% decrease from the previous year. Revenue for the Nike Brand fell 9% to $44.7 billion, with reductions across all regions. Digital sales suffered particularly, plummeting 20% as Nike attempted to rebalance its direct-to-consumer approach. At the same time, wholesale revenue dropped 9%, although Nike-owned physical outlets remained stable. Nike\u2019s profit margins were affected as it resorted to discounting and clearance sales to manage excess inventory. This, combined with a return to lower-margin wholesale channels, put pressure on profitability.  The Road Ahead: A Strategic Reset Nike has not provided full-year guidance for fiscal 2026 but has laid out plans to realign its operations around key sports categories, streamline the supply chain, and rejuvenate product storytelling. Tariffs are projected to raise costs by approximately $1 billion this year \u2014 a challenge Nike seeks to mitigate through pricing strategies, sourcing adjustments, and operational efficiencies. Importantly, the company plans to reduce its reliance on the China-based supply chain from 16% to the high single digits by the end of the year.   In the short term, Nike anticipates a decrease in Q1 sales by a mid-single-digit percentage, with gross margin compression ranging from 3.5 to 4.25 percentage points, including a 1-point impact from tariffs. Revenue for the current first quarter is expected to decline by a mid-single-digit percentage, which marks a considerable improvement from recent double-digit drops.  Valuation: Opportunity or Value Trap? At around $72 per share, Nike is trading at roughly 41 times its projected 2026 earnings \u2014 a significant premium compared to its three-year average of 28 times. Consensus forecasts predict a 1% revenue decline in FY 2026, followed by a possible rebound with 5% growth in FY 2027. MORE FOR YOU  The investment perspective now hinges entirely on the effectiveness of Nike\u2019s turnaround initiatives. If management is unable to stabilize margins and reignite top-line growth, the present valuation may turn out to be unsustainable. Downturn Risk: Not a Defensive Play Nike has demonstrated clear susceptibility during previous market downturns. In 2020, shares fell nearly 40% within a few quarters, and during the 2022 inflation-driven decline, the stock experienced a 53% peak-to-trough drop \u2014 which was substantially worse than the S&P 500. Should macroeconomic conditions weaken once more, Nike could face further downside risk. A 50% decrease from current levels would lower the stock to approximately $35 \u2014 a feasible scenario for a company with high volatility and cyclical earnings.  Bottom Line Nike is at a pivotal moment. It\u2019s exhibiting early signs of stabilization but continues to confront margin pressures, macro risks, and valuation concerns. Although its brand remains robust and its long-term strategy appears promising, effective execution will be crucial. As with any investment, it\u2019s important to carefully assess the advantages and disadvantages and consider diversified alternatives to mitigate risk. The Trefis High-Quality portfolio, featuring a collection of 30 stocks, boasts a history of comfortable outperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the last four years. What accounts for this? As a cohort, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index, with less market turbulence, as illustrated by HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

(Photo by Brendan Smialowski and JIM WATSON / AFP) (Photo by BRENDAN SMIALOWSKIJIM WATSON/AFP via Getty Images)AFP via Getty Images  Key Facts   In the first half of 2025, stock market indices barely budged \u2014 the S&P 500 and Nasdaq inched up 5,2% as of June 27.    The first half of 2024 was much more profitable for investors as the S&P 500 rose 14% and the Nasdaq increased 18%.    In 2025, tariff concerns, slower economic growth, high market volatility and slower rate cuts also tamped down stock averages.    The market averages did relatively poorly in the first half of 2025 compared to the year before. The DJIA was up 3.4% \u2014 compared to a 4% for the first half of 2024; the S&P 500 (+5.2%) vs. 14% in the first half of 2024; and Nasdaq (+5.2%) vs. 18% in the first half of 2024, according to Google Finance. The lower growth of the Nasdaq in the first half of 2025 compared to the first half of 2024 is likely due to slower economic growth and more uncertainty, much higher volatility and a shift away from the U.S., and less aggressive rate cuts.  These stock-unfriendly conditions contrast sharply with last years\u2019 generative AI frenzy, about which I wrote in Brain Rush, relatively strong corporate earnings, and investor expectations for rate cuts.   Slower Economic Growth And Increased Uncertainty  Tariff Concerns: The first half of 2025 has been marked by renewed concerns about the impact of trade tariffs and protectionist policies, particularly related to the Trump administration. These policies create uncertainty about future economic growth, which can weigh on investor sentiment, noted Investopedia. Decelerating GDP Growth: Projections indicate a deceleration in U.S. GDP growth in 2025 compared to 2024. This slowdown in economic expansion, coupled with rising inflation due to higher import costs, creates a challenging environment for market growth, reported CBS News.  Shift In Market Dynamics  Focus on International Markets: Lagging U.S. stock performance and uncertainty regarding U.S. policy have prompted investors to consider international markets for opportunities. This diversification can lead to a less concentrated focus on the domestic tech-heavy Nasdaq, noted Charles Schwab. Market Volatility: The market has experienced a volatile period with initial losses followed by a sharp rebound. This volatility, including fluctuations related to interest rates, can make investors more cautious and lead to slower growth compared to a strong bull market.  Less Aggressive Interest Rate Cuts  Slower Pace of Cuts: While interest rate cuts were anticipated and partially supported market gains in 2024, the pace of these cuts might be slower than initially expected in 2025. This slower pace could limit the upward pressure on stock valuations.  Why The First Half Of 2024 Was Better For Stocks  Artificial Intelligence Frenzy: The AI boom and the performance of related stocks, like Nvidia, noted Brain Rush, contributed to significant gains in the Nasdaq and the broader market. Strong Corporate Earnings: Corporate earnings in the first half of 2024 were generally strong supporting positive investor sentiment. Expectations for Rate Cuts: Market expectations for multiple interest rate cuts fueled optimism about the economy and stock valuations.   First Half 2025 Winners And Losers Top performing S&P 500 stocks benefited from changes in government policy which in some cases included government contracts.  Palantir Technologies shares \u2014 about which I wrote in a February Forbes post \u2014 rose 74.2% in the first half of 2025, benefiting from AI-powered services and government contracts, according to Yahoo! Finance. NRG Energy (+74.5%). Shares rose due to solid financial performance and prospects for growth due to the company\u2019s decarbonization strategy, noted The Globe And Mail. Howmet Aerospace (+67%). The aerospace parts provider\u2019s stock increased with help from strong demand from the commercial and defense sectors, reported Yahoo! Finance.  The biggest S&P 500 losers in the first half suffered from a drop in consumer spending related to tariff increases and economic uncertainty along with government health care policy changes. The three biggest losers include:  Deckers Outdoor\u2019s stock price fell 49.2% in the first half of 2025 due largely to tariff uncertainty which contributed to the company\u2019s failure to offer 2025 guidance during the first quarter earnings, wrote Investopedia. UnitedHealth (-38.7%) suffered a drop in share price in the wake of a sharp increase in healthcare utilization and a reduced earnings per share forecast, according to TipRanks. Moderna (-35,3%). Moderna shares fell after a cut in its 2025 revenue forecast resulting from reduced demand for its Covid-19 vaccine and the loss of a government contract to develop a bird flu vaccine, noted Trefis.  Companies such as Palantir and Oracle that the Trump administration favors \u2014both were co-sponsors of Trump\u2019s military birthday parade, SFGate reports \u2014 could enjoy a continued rise in their stock prices. Meanwhile companies vulnerable to tariffs and changing health care policies may continue to tank. Editorial StandardsReprints & Permissions",

        "content": "Chipotle's stock has recovered, and then some, from its post-\"Liberation Day\" slump. Wall Street doesn't expect much more upside. What gives? That\u2019s the latest question for investors in the burrito-rolling, quesadilla-flipping, taco-topping giant, shares of which rose more than 30% in 2024 but this year\u2014despite their steady climb since early April\u2014are down nearly 9% through Friday's close. Analysts broadly see plenty of room for Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) to keep growing. Management is targeting thousands of new restaurants in North America alone. But the companyin late April warnedof lesssame-store salesgrowth this year than previously expected. The closely watched number turned negative in the first quarter amid economic uncertainty and other factors. That has contributed to a tepid outlook for the historically high-flying stock\u2014and several others in the food business, to be sure\u2014among sell-side analysts. The current mean price target for Chipotle, as tracked by Visible Alpha, is $59.12, 7% above Friday\u2019s close. Even at that level, Chipotle would still be down for the year. \"With recent underlying momentum strong, we believe Chipotle shares once again justify a premium valuation on what should be outsized top and bottom-line growth going forward,\" Barclays analysts wrote Thursday.\"However, we struggle to forecast additional upside, with expectations already elevated and high-growth concepts vulnerable to a slowing macro.\" Barclays reiterated a \"neutral\" rating, lifting its price target\u2014but only by $2, to $54, a boost more restrained than those it gave to shares of several counterparts, Shake Shack (SHAK) among them. JPMorgan analysts in late May reiterated a \"neutral\" rating on Chipotle, clipping their price target by $4 to $54, and on Wednesday called the stock \"near fairly priced.\" Chipotle's second-quarter results are due July 23.Wall Street is looking for a 2.9% year-over-year drop in same-store sales, far worse than the 0.4% the company reported for the first quarter. In the company's Q1 earnings conference call, according to a transcript provided by AlphaSense, CEO Scott Boatwright said the consumer was \"sitting on the sideline.\" To be sure, there's more bullishness out there in some corners\u2014including at Stifel, which at $65 is one of a few outfits tied with the highest target as tracked by Visible Alpha. \"We were encouraged [that] the company is responding quickly to the realities of the current environment,\" the bank's analysts wrote in late April. \"We believe Chipotle is well-positioned to regain sales momentum.\"",

        "content": "TheS&P 500(^GSPC0.52%)has more than recovered its losses from earlier this year and is now up nearly 4.4% year to date. Many mega-cap tech-focused companies have posted sizable gains -- including\"Magnificent Seven\"membersMeta Platforms(META1.04%),Microsoft(MSFT-0.30%), andNvidia(NVDA1.74%). But investors may be souring onTesla(TSLA-0.67%),Apple(AAPL0.04%), andAlphabet(GOOG2.30%)(GOOGL2.70%)due, in part, to their apparent lack of artificial intelligence (AI) achievements. Here's what's going wrong for thesegrowth stocks, and whether they are buys now. Image source: Getty Images. A great divide has appeared through the Magnificent Seven between companies whose investment theses have been enhanced by AI and those whose theses have not. Perhaps the simplest reason why Tesla, Apple, and Alphabet are underperforming their Magnificent Seven peers is that they are on the unfavorable side of this great divide.  Data byYCharts. Just a couple of months ago, Tesla was down around 45% in 2025. It has recovered a substantial amount of those losses despiteplummeting vehicle deliveries. Tesla stock popped after its robotaxi event showcasedprogress on self-driving cars.Some investors have been waiting nearly a decade for this update, so it's understandable that the stock reacted favorably to the event. Given the weak results in Tesla's core business, Tesla's investment thesis increasingly relies on longer-term bets on self-driving cars and robotics. Tesla could benefit from AI one day, but it isn't monetizing it to a significant extent right now. Apple is in a similar boat. Its core business is selling tech-focused consumer products and services. Apple hasn't made meaningful AI improvements to its product suite, but it has released a slew of new tools and asoftware interface updatethat tout AI capabilities. However, it remains to be seen if Apple will be a net beneficiary of AI. AI presents arguably the best opportunity in decades for competition to tap into Apple's dominant smartphone market share. Apple has grown increasingly dependent on sales outside the U.S., but has been losing market share in key markets like China due to intense competition from companies likeXiaomi, Huawei, and Vivo. Like Tesla, Apple could benefit from AI in the near future. But so far, AI simply hasn't been a catalyst for the company in the same way it has for other mega-cap tech-focused companies. Alphabet is much more of a mixed bag. AI growth is a boon for cloud computing, and Google Cloud is the No. 3 player in the space behindAmazon(AMZN2.66%)Web Services and Microsoft Azure. Alphabet-owned YouTube can also benefit from AI, as it helps creators produce content and streamline suggested videos and advertisements better targeted to individual users. Google's self-driving car project, Waymo, could also benefit from AI. Alphabet-owned generative AI model Gemini is a multimodal tool -- meaning it can work with text, audio, visuals, video, and even code. Gemini got off to a rocky start, but now it's a major player in the chatbot space, along with OpenAI's ChatGPT, Anthropic's Claude, and other generative AI companies. However, the elephant in the room is uncertainty about how AI could affect Alphabet's cash cow, Google Search. Integrating Gemini with Google Search, or simply changing Google Search from a web page ranking tool to an interactive information powerhouse, could be a simple and effective way for Alphabet to hold its own despite mounting competition. But there's no denying that Google Search is facing its biggest challenge in decades from competitors' AI-powered search offerings. That uncertainty alone, despite all the other ways Alphabet benefits from AI, has led some investors to avoid and/or dump the stock. Buying Tesla, Apple, or Alphabet is a belief that these companies will be able to adapt in the age of AI -- even if they don't benefit drastically from it. Tesla is arguably the highest-risk name given its lofty valuation (it has the highestprice-to-earnings (P/E) ratioand highest forward P/E ratio of the Magnificent Seven). But Apple and Alphabet both have more reasonable valuations (31.2 P/E for Apple and just 18.6 for Alphabet). These companies also generate a ton of free cash flow and earnings that they can use to reinvest in the business and return capital to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. Additionally, Apple and Alphabet have substantially more cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities on their balance sheets than long-term debt. Apple's big product launch this September could be just what the company needs to prove that it has the hardware and software to attract Wall Street's attention. Alphabet investors should continue to monitor the performance of the company's services segment, which is led by Google Search. So far, Google Search ad revenue has beenincredibly strongdespite increased adoption of ChatGPT and other competition. Until that trend shifts, it's hard to get too pessimistic about Alphabet, especially with potential upside from Gemini and Waymo. The beauty about being an individual investor is that you don't have to agree with Wall Street sentiment and can take advantage of when great companies go on sale. Short-term-minded investors may pass on Tesla, Apple, and Alphabet simply because they aren't proven AI plays, but all three stocks could still be worth buying and holding for long-term investors. At this juncture, Apple and Alphabet present far more compelling risk and potential reward profiles than Tesla -- especially Alphabet, given its dirt-cheap valuation. So Alphabet would be my top pick of these three underperformers, with Apple as a close second. However, the best buy ultimately depends on your personal risk tolerance and the end markets you believe will thrive over the long term.",

        "content": "(Reuters) -Nvidia insiders sold over $1 billion worth of company stock in the past year, with a notable uptick in recent trading activity as executives capitalize on surging investor interest in artificial intelligence, the Financial Times reported on Sunday. More than $500 million of the share sales took place this month as the California-based chips designer's share price climbed to an all-time high, the report said. Jensen Huang, Nvidia's chief executive, started selling shares this week for the first time since September, the SEC filing showed. Nvidia's stock hit a record on Wednesday, and the chipmaker reclaimed the crown as the world's most valuable company after an analyst said the chipmaker was set to ride a \"Golden Wave\" of artificial intelligence. Its latest gains reflect the U.S. stock market's return to the \"AI trade\" that fueled massive gains in chip stocks and related technology companies in recent years on optimism about the emerging technology. Nvidia did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Nvidia's shares have rebounded over 60% from their closing low on April 4, when Wall Street was reeling from President Donald Trump's global tariff announcements. U.S. stocks, including Nvidia, have recovered on expectations the White House will reach trade deals to soften the tariffs. (Reporting by Devika Nair in Bengaluru; Editing by Kim Coghill)",

        "content": "Your 50s can be a wake-up call: Retirement isn\u2019t theoretical anymore. With the clock ticking, the decisions you make now can dramatically affect the life you lead later. Frommaximizing your savingsto reassessing your investment strategy andplanning for long-term care, here are five expert-approved moves to secure your financial future. Think of maximizing yourretirement contributions and catch-up optionsas \u201cplanting seeds for your financial future,\u201d says Mallon FitzPatrick, head of wealth planning at Robertson Stephens. In 2025, those 50 and older can contribute anextra $7,500 to a 401(k)(in addition to the $23,500 limit for everyone else). Once you\u2019re 60 to 63, some plans allow an additional $11,250 if your employer permits it. FitzPatrick also recommends considering Roth conversions in lower-income years because they establish atax-free income streamin retirement. Working with a good financial planner to tailor strategies to your income bracket and deduction options can be a good idea, too, especially if you\u2019re a high earner, a business owner, or itemizing deductions. About 70% of people over 65 will need some form of long-term care, and Medicare won\u2019t cover it.FitzPatrick recommends starting in your 50s by evaluating hybrid policies,self-insurance strategies, and the potential use of home equity. Hybrid policies, for example, can combine health insurance with long-term care benefits, offering some relief in case you need long-term care, while home equity conversion mortgages, the most common type of reverse mortgage, can help those 62 and older tap into funds for living expenses. \u201cPlanning for long-term care isn\u2019t just an expense; it\u2019s peace of mind for future challenges,\u201d FitzPatrick says. \u201cIt\u2019s not only about funding but also the model of care and who will manage it.\u201d \u201cChoosing when toclaim Social Securityis like orchestrating a financial symphony,\u201d FitzPatrick says. Claiming early reduces monthly benefits, while delaying to age 70 increases them significantly. Married couples can optimize their benefits by having the higher earner delay to boost both their own and the survivor\u2019s benefits. The Social Security Administration has resources and calculators to help you plan. And if you\u2019re still having trouble determining what\u2019s best for you, abreakeven analysis with a financial advisorcan help. \u201cWhen you enter your 50s, this is a great time toreassess both how much you are savingfor retirement and your overall asset allocation,\u201d says Carla Adams, founder of Ametrine Wealth. She recommends reducing stock exposure if it\u2019s overly aggressive (e.g., 80% or more in equities) but warns against going too conservative. \u201cYour true time horizon is not yourdesiredretirement age but your lifespan,\u201d she says. As more people live into their 90s, this means considering a plan that takes into account 30 or more years in retirement. Target-date funds are one easy way to manage this, but Adams suggests choosing one with a later retirement date if you want to stay more aggressive. \u201cBeware the temptation to jump into retirement too soon,\u201d FitzPatrick says. Even a moderate delay can extend your savings, preserve health insurance, andboost your Social Security benefits. In fact, a 2018 study by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that a 66-year-old worker\u2019s retirement income can rise by nearly 8% if they work one year longer and wait an extra year to claim Social Security, thanks largely to the rise in benefits. For those not wanting to continue working full-time,exploring part-time rolesor transitioning to a less demanding yet fulfilling career can be a viable alternative, FitzPatrick says. Your 50s are a time totake your retirement plan seriously. That doesn\u2019t just mean saving more\u2014it means thinking holistically about healthcare, tax efficiency, income timing, asset allocation, and your lifestyle choices. With the right strategy and a few key adjustments, you can still make this decade your most powerful yet for building the retirement you want.",

        "content": "WhileNvidiagets all the attention among companies providing chips and equipment to AI data centers, there are dozens of others benefiting from the soaring spending from the industry's hyperscalers.Advanced Micro Devices(AMD0.05%)andArista Networks(ANET-2.17%)have both seen their revenue climb thanks to ongoing AI spending. But if you can buy only one of them, AMD is the stock to own right now. Both companies are executing well with strong demand for their products and a huge runway as AI spending takes off. But AMD's stock looks more attractive for multiple reasons. Here's what investors need to know. Image source: Getty Images. AMD's management sees the AI accelerator market, which includes GPUs and custom-built silicon, exceeding $500 billion by 2028. That's more than 60% annual growth from 2025 to 2028. For reference, the company's data center revenue, which includes GPUs designed for AI training and inference as well as CPUs, totaled just $12.6 billion last year. So, even if management's estimates turn out to be too high and it captures just a tiny sliver of that market, there's still a lot of growth ahead for the business. And AMD is positioned to capture a good portion of that market. It introduced several new products at its Advancing AI event earlier this month, including the Instinct MI350 series of GPUs. It also said the rack-scale MI400 will come out next year, which will compete with Nvidia's Rubin line, scheduled to come out in the second half of 2026. AMD says the MI400 series will be 10 times more powerful than the 300 series, while Nvidia expects a 3.3 improvement multiple in its next generation. With improved relative performance, AMD's position as an alternative to Nvidia for hyperscalers is strengthening. Its unlikely to overtake the market leader, but it's important for companies building out newdata centersto have an alternative if there are supply shortages and to prevent overdependence on one supplier. AMD's strong position in data center CPUs could also make it a staple for years to come. It's consistently taking share in the market, which provides a steady and growing base for its data center business. But that also means that this revenue probably won't outpace Nvidia's growth until GPUs become the main source of revenue for the segment. For example, AMD's data center revenue increased 57% last quarter versus Nvidia's 73% increase. Shares of AMD currently trade for about 37 times forward earnings estimates. That looks expensive at first blush, but earnings will be weighed down by charges related to Chinese export controls. Without those headwinds, analysts see earnings growing 47% in 2026, and they could rise more than 20% per year from there with strong data center revenue and overall margin expansion. So, at just 24.5 times 2026 earnings expectations, it looks like an interesting investment opportunity. Arista makes network switches that can scale up to huge AI accelerator clusters while maintaining high data-transfer speeds. When it comes toAI training, ensuring that data can get from one server to another is of the utmost importance, as any level of latency is magnified exponentially as clusters and AI models grow bigger. The company's equipment helps ensure limited downtime for the expensive AI accelerator chips lining the server racks of AI data centers. The combination of high-end hardware and its extensible operating system (EOS) gives Arista a key competitive advantage. EOS makes it easier for data center operators to get the most out of their equipment with AI-focused features like the newly released cluster load balancing -- in which a cluster of servers maximize performance by distributing incoming traffic among themselves to avoid overwhelming any one server. Nvidia is starting to encroach on Arista's market, however, with the introduction of its Spectrum-X networking platform. The system is designed to work with its GPU clusters, taking advantage of Nvidia's dominant position in the chip market. But Arista's modular and programmable system is much more flexible, and theswitching costsof overhauling entire data centers are significant. As such, it's hard to see the company losing its top position in networking equipment, especially as AI accelerator purchases evolve. As spending on AI accelerators climbs toward that $500 billion-plus estimate from AMD's management, Arista should benefit as the top provider of network switch equipment. With most of that growth coming from its biggest customers, investors shouldn't expect strong gross margin expansion. Meanwhile, the company may have to spend heavily on marketing, along with research and development, to fend off competition from the likes of Nvidia, which may limit operating leverage. That said, Arista's profit margins are already relatively high. With the stock trading for about 37 times forward earnings expectations, that makes it just as expensive as AMD. But analysts don't see earnings rising at the same rate as AMD's will, with an average increase in earnings per share of just 18% over the next three years. As such, the price looks much more expensive for what you get compared to AMD, and it's worth waiting for the stock to come down before investing. So, investors looking to invest in one of the top AI stocks not named Nvidia  could do well with one of its closest competitors, AMD.",

        "content": "Investing.com - Japanese semiconductor production equipment names have risen rapidly over the past month, driven in part by increased demand from artificial intelligence chipmakers for testers of the technology, according to analysts at Bernstein. In a note to clients, the analysts led by David Dai highlighted several of these firms that have seen their share prices rally in recent weeks. Advantest (TYO:6857), a manufacturer of automatic chip testing gear, has been one particular beneficiary, with the stock spiking on expectations for higher demand from firms like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and TSMC, the strategists said. However, they suggested that investors \"take profit now,\" arguing that revenue in the years to come at the company is \"unlikely to present much growth year-over-year due to capacity build out this year.\" Advantest shares are also richly valued, they flagged, adding that many projections for tester demand \"that\u2019s been floating around are likely misleading, as they may have confused the old and new testers.\" Other backend Japanese chip equipment makers have also seen their shares rise, although small cap firms \"may still have upside,\" the analysts said. They especially like Disco (OTC:DSCSY) Corporation (TYO:6146), a precision tools manufacturer, highlighting the business\u2019s \"long term growth prospects,\" including drivers such as \"backside power, NAND stacking, and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) WMCM packaging.\" But front end equipment makers provide a \"better opportunity\" for investors, the Bernstein analysts said. \"We continue to like Kokusai (TYO:7722) and Tokyo Electron (TYO:8035) for the growth in memory and China equipment demand. Our recent China WFE tracker suggests strong China WFE demand continues this year,\" they wrote. \"The recent potential restriction on foreign fabs in China would be additional reason to buy Japan front end equipment.\" The strategists gave Advantest a \"market-perform\" rating, while Disco, Kokusai and Tokyo Electron were rated as \"outperform.\" Related articles Bernstein weighs in on the path ahead for Japanese semiconductor equipment stocks UBS examines how this year\u2019s hurricane season could impact European reinsurers AI growth brings new tests for semi-test duopoly",

One ofthe most common calls among Wall Street strategistsentering the year was for the AI trade to expand further from seven key popular players into a slew of other areas of the market. Since the April 8 market bottom, it's been happening. AI chip and data center trades not named Nvidia (NVDA) have been among the S&P 500's (^GSPC) best performers, with Broadcom (AVGO), AMD (AMD), and Dell (DELL) up roughly 70% or more in that timeframe. The AI energy trade has taken off too, with Vistra Corp (VST) and NRG Energy (NRG) up more than 80%. The AI cloud trade has emerged as well, with Oracle (ORCL) up more than 70% and trading at an all-time high. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo'sTermsandPrivacy Policy To be fair, some of the\"Magnificent Seven\"have also risen off the bottom. Nvidia has led the pack, rising over 60% torecently notch a new all-time high. But as our Chart of the Week shows, none of the Magnificent Seven have outperformed the other AI stocks that are among the top 20 best-performing stocks in the S&P 500 since the market bottom. After two years ofthere only being a few large-cap tech names in town, investors looking to outperform the market during the massive run higher of the past two months have had more success looking beyond the most popular stocks of the current bull market. This reveals a common truth about bull markets. They're about themes, not individual stocks. In the 1920s, the bull market was defined bysurging demand for radio communications and automobiles.The dot-com bubble that ran in the late 1990s was, of course, focused on the initial hype of the internet. But after rising more than 270% from 1995 to the end of 1996, Cisco (CSCO),the poster child of the era, wasn't among the market's top 10 performers come 1997 to 1999. The theme stayed, but the best-performing stocks in the market oscillated. If you listen closely, that's what many on Wall Street have been saying for a while now. It's an AI and tech bull market, not the \"Magnificent Seven\" bull market. Whatever it's called, it's certainly ongoing and has \"further to run, as Julian Emanuel, who leads the equity, derivatives, and quantitative strategy team at Evercore ISI, wrote this week in a note to clients. \"Despite the near-term uncertainty,\" he wrote, \"the four elements that end bull markets [a recession, Fed hikes, spiking bond yields, and extreme stock valuations] are all absent.\" Josh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "Tesla (TSLA) is widely expected to report quarterly delivery numbers on Wednesday morning, with analysts anticipating another double-digit decline year-over-year. The company is projected to post deliveries of just under 400,000 vehicles for the second quarter, according to estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. That would be down 10% from thesame time a year ago, when Tesla reported north of 440,000 deliveries, while production is forecast to increase to about 434,200 vehicles from 410,831 in the year-ago quarter. Demand for Tesla's vehicles hastaken a hit this yearin key markets like the U.S. and Europe amid a political backlash against CEO Elon Musk's involvement with the Trump administration. The company's first-quarter deliveries fellwell below estimates. The latest deliveries data also comes days after thedeparture of Omead Afshar, who oversaw Tesla's sales and manufacturing in North America and Europe, and became the latest in a string of executive departures,Bloombergreported. Analysts from Deepwater Asset Management said in a recent report that they expect the second quarter could be the low point for Tesla's delivery numbers, with a recovery likely in the second half of the year, citing improving brand perception among other things. Analysts from RBC Capital Markets on Thursday forecast about 366,000 deliveries, below the Street consensus, suggesting demand could be delayed with some consumers waiting for the more affordable model Muskhas said would launchin the first half of this year. Baird analysts, who said the more affordable model may be delayed, told clients Wednesday that \"while deliveries still remain an important piece of the fundamentals, we note that therecent launch of robotaxiand excitement regarding this opportunity will likely take precedence in the near term.\" Tesla's stock has divided analysts tracked by Visible Alpha, with 10 \"buy\" ratings compared to four \"hold,\" and four \"sell\" ratings. Their price targets range from $160 to $500, with an average near $306, below the stock's recent levels.

        "content": "Investing.com -- Markets closed the week positively, with stocks reaching a record high on Friday. The optimism was largely fueled by signs of progress in U.S.-China trade talks, which saw both nations confirming an agreement. In the U.S., the benchmark S&P 500 index and Nasdaq hit all-time highs. Here are Investing.com\u2019s stocks of the week. Nike shares surged Friday after the company posted its latest quarterly earnings, topping consensus expectations for profit and revenue. The sportswear giant\u2019s CEO, Elliott Hill, stated that the company is \u201cturning the page and the next step is aligning our teams to lead with sport. through what we are calling the sport offense.\u201d Reacting to the report, HSBC upgraded Nike to Buy from Hold, raising its target for the stock to $80 from $60 per share. \u201cWe think there is more than tangible evidence that Nike has a path to see its sales rebound in the not-too-distant future, and its margins to be repaired, and this despite an unfavourable tariff headwind which the group believes could weigh for 75bps on gross margin in FY May 2026,\u201d the bank wrote in a note to clients. Nike shares are on course to gain more than 20% over the last week. Nvidia shares hit a new all-time high for the first time since January this week. The stock has risen by more than 9% in the last week. Furthermore, the company is nearing a market capitalization $4 trillion. In a note to clients Friday, Wedbush analysts said \u201cthe race to $4 trillion market cap has begun with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Nvidia nearing,\u201d adding both companies are \u201cfoundational pieces of building on the biggest tech trend we have seen in our 25 years covering tech stocks.\u201d HIMS shares tumbled more than 34% on Monday, with the stock down around 22% in the last week. Monday\u2019s plunge came after Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) terminated a short-lived deal to sell its Wegovy weight-loss drug through Hims & Hers Health. Novo said it ended the collaboration due to \u201cHims & Hers deceptive promotion and selling of illegitimate, knockoff versions of Wegovy\u00ae that put patient safety at risk.\u201d AVAV surged this week, gaining around 45% after reporting quarterly earnings that impressed investors and analysts alike. The company beat consensus earnings and revenue expectations. \u201c4Q25 results were better-than-anticipated,\u201d said analysts at Stifel. \u201cWe are positive on management\u2019s plans to accelerate CapEx spending as we expect investors to begin to look more favorably on organic growth investments in new defense tech.\u201d The firm reiterated its Buy rating and $240 target price on AVAV shares. Core Scientific stock also surged this week, gaining more than 33% on Thursday after reports emerged that CoreWeave, a provider of artificial intelligence cloud infrastructure, is once again in advanced talks to acquire the bitcoin mining and hosting company. According to a report by The Wall Street Journal, the two firms could finalize a transaction in the coming weeks, provided negotiations proceed smoothly. Following the reports, Jefferies analysts stated in a note: \u201cIn our view, the combination of the two makes strategic sense for CRWV to vertically integrate its infrastructure, reduce opex, and use the CORZ platform to grow its DC development pipeline. \u201cWe estimate a potential takeout value range of $16-$23.\" Core Scientific shares are up approximately 40% in the last week. Last week, Circle made the list as its stock gained significant momentum following its market debut earlier this month. The company\u2019s shares were also boosted last week by news that the U.S. Senate had approved a milestone stablecoin bill, which could bring regulatory clarity to the cryptocurrency sector. However, the stock has since pulled back, down around 21% in the last week. In a note to clients this week, Compass Point initiated coverage on CRCL with a Neutral rating and a $205 price target. The firm pointed to both its leadership in regulated stablecoins and challenges in distribution as reasons for its cautious rating. Analysts noted that stablecoins could disrupt traditional finance by disintermediating banks and payment networks.

        "header": "Why Are Meta Platforms, Microsoft, and Nvidia Outperforming the \"Magnificent Seven\" and the S&P 500?",
        "content": "Meta Platforms(META1.04%),Microsoft(MSFT-0.28%), andNvidia(NVDA1.74%)are knocking on the door of all-time highs, whereas the other four \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks--Amazon,Alphabet,Tesla, andApple-- are down year to date. What gives? Here's why artificial intelligence (AI) monetization is a key differentiating factor that separates Meta, Microsoft, and Nvidia from the rest of the pack -- and why all threegrowth stockscould still have further room to run. Image source: Getty Images. Meta, Microsoft, and Nvidia benefit from AI in a variety of ways. These benefits could be the primary reason for the strong performance of all three stocks relative to theS&P 500year to date.  METAdata byYCharts Meta uses AI to improve its algorithm, keeping users engaged and connecting advertisers with potential buyers. The longer users stay on Meta's Family of Apps (Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp, and Threads), the more attractive those platforms become for advertisers. Meta is expanding its AI investments bypouring capital expendituresinto other AI endeavors, like the Meta AI App. Launched on April 29, the app is built with the latest version of Meta's large language model, Llama 4. The app offers a personalized AI experience designed around voice conversation. Microsoft has integrated AI across its Microsoft 365 suite (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, etc.) through an AI feature called Copilot, GitHub Copilot for developers, Azure AI services for cloud computing, and more. AI presents arguably the most impactful product upgrade in years for Microsoft's legacy software suite and Intelligent Cloud platform. Nvidia makes graphics processing units (GPUs), which are the workhorses that power data centers. More computing power will be needed to support growing AI adoption and theincreasing complexity of AI models. Nvidia is the undisputed leader in providing a full stack of AI computing solutions that includes hardware (GPUs), software, and other cloud-based solutions. Meanwhile, Nvidia AI software tools like CUDA and TensorRT help developers use Nvidia GPUs for everything from general-purpose computing tasks to training deep learning models. The market hates uncertainty, but it also loves companies with a clear vision for growing revenue and converting capital expenditures into free cash flow. Meta, Microsoft, and Nvidia all have multiple ways to grow earnings. Meta has steadily increased its advertising revenue and profitability over time, largely thanks to Instagram's innovations in short-form videos through Reels. Regardless of the success of the Meta AI app or Meta's other projects in augmented and virtual reality (like Meta Quest), the company could still generate solid growth from its Family of Apps alone. Microsoft is in a similar boat. It benefits from AI, but it isn't a pure-play AI company. Microsoftgenerates a ton of cashthat it can funnel directly into long-term growth projects, while still having plenty of dry powder to manage its operating expenses and return cash to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. Nvidia has transformed its business from relying largely on gaming, professional visualization, cryptocurrency, and other end markets to being a majority of data center-focused business. This concentration makes Nvidia more of a pure-play AI name than Meta and Microsoft, which comes with higher risk and higher potential reward. What's more, Nvidia's sky-high operating margins have helped the company convert a substantial amount of revenue into profit. But competition or a slowdown in AI spending may lead to margin erosion over time. Even if that happens, the company could still grow earnings at a steady rate -- just not at the pace investors have grown accustomed to in recent years. Despite outperforming the S&P 500 and their Magnificent Seven peers so far this year, Meta, Microsoft, and Nvidia all sport surprisingly reasonable valuations.  TSLA PE Ratio (Forward)data byYCharts Except for Tesla on the high end and Alphabet on the low end, most of the Magnificent Seven haveforward price-to-earnings ratiosin the mid-20s to the mid-30s. This is far from value territory, but it is also not expensive, given how far these stocks have climbed in recent years. As mentioned, Meta, Microsoft, and Nvidia's high margins are a big reason to be optimistic about their future earnings growth. And, to no surprise, these three companies have the highestprofit marginsof the Magnificent Seven.  NVDA Profit Margindata byYCharts Nvidia's 51.7% profit margin means that it converts over half of every dollar in sales into pure net income. That level of profitability is almost unheard of, especially for a majority hardware company. It also provides a cushion by which Nvidia's margins could come down and it would still be a phenomenal business. Granted, it's important to note that profit margin is not an apples-to-apples comparison. Amazon's profit margin looks low because of its high-volume but low-margin e-commerce business. Amazon Web Services makes up a fraction of Amazon's total sales, but it contributes the majority of its operating income because it is such a high-margin segment. Similarly, Tesla's primary business is manufacturing cars -- a traditionally low-margin business. Meta, Microsoft, and Nvidia stand out as long-term winners due to their established and industry-leading high-margin business models, upside potential from AI, and reasonable valuations. However, these stocks are not cheap. A growth slowdown could make any of these stocks appear more expensive in the near term. So it's best to only approach these names if you have at least a three- to five-year investment time horizon.",

        "content": "Nvidiasupplies the best data center chips for artificial intelligence (AI) development, and with a market capitalization of $3.6 trillion, it's now one of the largest companies in the world. There is still room for itsstock to move higher, but investors who already own it might be looking for other AI names with growth potential. C3.ai(AI-1.70%)developed a portfolio of over 130 ready-made applications to help businesses accelerate their adoption of AI.Upstart Holdings(UPST0.13%), on the other hand, created an AI-powered lending algorithm that helps banks assess the creditworthiness of potential borrowers far more effectively than traditional methods. Both companies have rapidly growing businesses and enormous addressable markets, so here's why it might be a great idea for investors to add C3.ai and Upstart to their portfolios for the long term. Image source: Getty Images. Very few companies have the financial resources or the technical expertise to developAI softwarefrom scratch, so they are turning to third-party vendors like C3.ai to meet their needs. C3.ai can deliver a custom AI application to a business customer in as little as three months from the initial project briefing, whether they operate in financial services, retail, manufacturing, oil and gas, or a host of other industries. C3.ai also stepped into agentic AI recently. It developed a platform that allows businesses to create and deploy virtual assistants into their operations to analyze data, automate workflows, and even influence key decisions. The platform connects to over 200 third-party databases and software applications so businesses can tap into their most valuable data to extract the most out of their AI agents. SalesforceCEO Mark Benioff says the market for \"digital labor\" -- or agents -- could be as large as $12 trillion in the future, so C3.ai might be on the cusp of the biggest financial opportunity in its history thanks to its agentic platform. Businesses can access C3.ai's products through leadingcloudproviders likeAmazonWeb Services,MicrosoftAzure, andAlphabet'sGoogle Cloud. They can scale C3.ai's software using the computing capacity on offer from those cloud providers, so they don't have to bear the enormous cost of maintaining their own infrastructure. C3.ai is building some serious momentum right now. The company generated a record $389.1 million in revenue during its fiscal 2025 (which ended on April 30), representing an increase of 25% compared to the prior year. That growth rate accelerated for the second straight year. Shares of C3.ai are down 85% from their record high, which was set during the tech frenzy in 2020. The stock was unquestionably overvalued back then with itsprice-to-sales (P/S) ratiosoaring to around 80, but it has since come down to a more reasonable level of 7.8. In fact, that's a 19% discount to its three-year average of 9.7 (which excludes the expensive 2021 period), so the stock might actually be undervalued now:  AI PS Ratiodata byYCharts The combination of C3.ai's momentum, its sizable market opportunity in areas like agentic AI, and its valuation creates a compelling opportunity for investors. Upstart thinks traditional human-led methods for assessing the creditworthiness of potential borrowers are outdated, partly because they center aroundFair Isaac'sFICOcredit scoring system, which only considers a handful of metrics like a person's outstanding debts and their repayment history. The company's \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 AI algorithm analyzes over 2,500 data points for every applicant to gain a better understanding of their creditworthiness. In fact, it's currently so good that it approves twice as many loans at a much lower averageinterest ratecompared to traditional assessment methods -- all while maintaining a comparable risk profile. Plus, 92% of Upstart's approvals are now fully automated, so applicants don't have to wait around for lengthy human assessment processes. Upstart earns a fee each time its platform originates a loan on behalf of its bank partners. The company specializes in unsecured personal loans, but it has a growing presence in car loans andhome equity lines of credit(HELOCs). There is still plenty of room for expansion into other segments like business loans, industrial loans, and credit cards over the long term. CEO Dave Girouard says $25 trillion worth of loans are originated worldwide each year across all segments, creating $1 trillion in fee revenue. He thinks all credit assessment processes will be handled by AI within the next decade, so Upstart is in a great position to capitalize on the enormous opportunity ahead. During the first quarter of 2025 (ended March 31), Upstart generated $213 million in totalrevenue, which was a 67% increase from the year-ago period. It was the fastest growth rate in three years, spurred by $2.1 billion in total loan originations, which was an 89% year-over-year jump. According to Wall Street's consensus estimate (provided by Yahoo! Finance), Upstart's annual revenue could top $1 billion in 2025 for the first time in the company's history. Upstart stock is down 84% from its 2021 peak. Like C3.ai, it was heavily overvalued back then with its P/S ratio surging to almost 50, but it has since come down to a more sustainable level of 8. Given the company's lightning fast revenue growth right now, and the incredible future opportunity in AI-powered loan originations, I think Upstart stock could be a great long-term buy at the current price.",

        "header": "Nvidia Stock: Buy at the Current High?",
        "content": "Nvidia(NVDA1.74%)has proven itself to be at the center of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. The company designs the most sought-after AI chips to power the performance of AI models and has expanded into a full range of AI products and services, from networking to enterprise software and even a new compute marketplace offering. All of these efforts have helped Nvidia's earnings roar higher, and the company ended the latest fiscal year at a record revenue level of $130 billion. To further illustrate the pace of growth, investors only have to look back two years. Then, Nvidia's annual revenue totaled $27 billion. Nvidia clearly has been a winner in this AI boom. This victory extends to stock price performance, with the shares climbing a jaw-dropping 1,500% over the past five years to reach a new high this week. Now the logical question is: Should you buy Nvidia at this high or wait for a lower entry point? Image source: Getty Images. Nvidia has played and surely will continue to play a pivotal role in the AI story. Nvidia sells the most powerfulgraphics processing units(GPUs) on the market and has designed a variety of other products to accompany them. So customers, for example, might use Nvidia GPUs along with its high-speed connection NVLink so processors can share data. Customers may opt for Nvidia application software to build AI agents and various AI workflows, or the company's infrastructure software to manage processes. And just recently, Nvidia launched DGX Cloud Lepton, a marketplace where developers can access GPUs from a variety of connected cloud providers. Thanks to its innovation throughout the AI universe, Nvidia has made itself an almost unavoidable option for most companies aiming to develop and apply AI to their businesses. Importantly, Nvidia also has been first to market with many of its products and services, allowing it to take the lead, and its ongoing innovation and this effort to continually offer customers more service options may keep it there. It's no surprise that all of this has resulted in soaring earnings -- rising in the double- and triple-digit percentages -- and high profitability on sales. Nvidia has maintained gross margin exceeding 70% during most quarters, only declining to 60% in the recent quarter due to a charge linked to lost sales in China. This leads me to themain risk to Nvidia right now, and that is its presence in that particular market, one that made up 13% of sales last year. The U.S. has imposed controls on exports of chips to China, blocking Nvidia's access to that market. The move prompted Nvidia to remove China from its sales forecasts due to being unable to predict what might happen. Nvidia surely would see higher growth if it could sell chips to China, but even without that market, growth is solid. It's important to remember that U.S. customers actually make up nearly half of Nvidia's total sales. Even in the worst scenario -- zero sales in China -- Nvidia's AI growth story remains bright. Even with growth going strong and the future looking bright, investors might wonder if buying Nvidia now, at a new high, is a good idea. The stock trades for 35 timesforward earnings estimates, higher than a few weeks ago, but lower than a peak of more than 50 just a few months ago. Considering Nvidia's earnings track record, market position, and future prospects, this looks like a reasonable price -- even if it's not at the dirt cheap levels of a few weeks ago. Of course, stocks rarely rise in one straight line, so there very well could be a dip in the weeks or months to come, offering an even more enticing entry point. But it's very difficult to time the market and get in at any stock's lowest point. It's a better idea to buy at a reasonable price and hold on for the long term. And here's why: Nvidia's gains or losses over a period of weeks or one quarter, for example, won't make much of a difference in your returns if you hold onto the stock for several years. That's why you don't necessarily have to worry about buying at the high when you're a long-term investor, as long as the stock's valuation is fair. That's the case of top AI stock Nvidia right now, making it a buy -- even at the high.",

        "content": "Unless you've been sleeping under a rock for the past three years, you're fully aware of just how much artificial intelligence (AI) has taken over the narratives in the stock market and the broader economy. Some lucky investors have gotten a lot more prosperous thanks to their well-timed investments in the companies that have led the charge on this new tech. For example, AI poster childNvidia'sstock has soared by 809% in the past three years. But businesses don't have to operate at the cutting edge of technology to deliver impressive share price gains. There are thriving companies elsewhere too. For example, this boringretail stockis up 232% in the past five years (as of June 24). Should you buy it right now? Image source: Getty Images. When investors are pondering which retailers they might want in their portfolios, they might think first of juggernauts likeAmazonorWalmart. But they shouldn't forget aboutCostco(COST0.25%), which has carved out a successful niche as the leading warehouse club operator. Costco has a strong brand thanks to its treasure hunt shopping experience and its low-priced but high-quality goods. It operates a membership-based model: Customers pay annual dues for the right to shop at Costco warehouses. As of May 11 -- the end of its fiscal 2025 third quarter -- it had 79.6 million memberships, up 6.8% year over year. In that quarter, Costco booked $62 billion in merchandise sales. This makes it one of the largest retailers on the face of the planet. The scale advantages it enjoys help support itseconomic moat. With incredible buying power that it can flex on its suppliers, Costco can reliably acquire merchandise at favorable costs, and it does a great job keeping its overhead in check. Selling, general, and administrative expenses were just 9% of total revenue in its fiscal Q3, less than half Walmart's nearly 21%. Shoppers benefit as its overall business model -- which relies primarily on the membership fees for its profits -- allows it to keep its merchandise prices low. It's a positive feedback loop that is unstoppable. Even in the face of the rising popularity of online shopping, Costco has continued to perform well. This gives me confidence in the company's long-term durability. Working together, these positive characteristics have benefited Costco financially.Same-store saleswere up 5.7% in the latest fiscal quarter, after increasing 5.3% in fiscal 2024 and 3% in fiscal 2023. The business seems to always operate from a position of strength, and continues to despite the uncertain macroeconomic backdrop. And in the past five years, Costco's earnings per share have climbed at a compound annual rate of 12.1%. Costco pays a $1.30 per share quarterly dividend that at the current share price yields a paltry 0.5%. However, the leadership team occasionally approves sizable one-time special dividends. The latest of these was a distribution of $15 per share in January 2024. The one prior to that was for $10 a share, distributed in December 2020. Costco's tremendous success is certainly an impressive thing to see, especially in the face of changing economic conditions. The customer loyalty it has earned works heavily in its favor. However, it's not lost on the investment community that Costco is a fantastic business. Shares have crushed theS&P 500indexduring the past one-, three-, five-, and 10-year periods. Costco doesn't fly under the radar. Everyone knows how reliably it delivers strong returns. On the one hand, that makes it a great investment this is. Even the late greatCharlie Mungernever sold a single share of Costco from his personal holdings, and he often mentioned publicly how much he loved the company. On the other hand, investors' appreciation for the business has caused them to bid its valuation up to a fairly excessive price-to-earnings ratio of 56.8. This means that investors should wait to buy the stock.",

        "content": "SoundHound AI(SOUN-0.91%), a developer of artificial intelligence (AI)-powered speech and audio recognition tools, has been a polarizing investment ever since its public debut three years ago. The bulls were initially impressed by its rapid growth, expanding customer base, and the disruptive potential of its tools, which could be customized for restaurants, vehicles, consumer electronics, and other markets.Nvidia's minor investment in the company raised even more green flags. However, a lot of SoundHound's growth was driven by its acquisitions rather than its organic improvements -- and it remained deeply unprofitable. It also faces stiff competition from similar voice recognition platforms, and many investors fled after Nvidia sold its entire stake\u00a0earlier this year. Image source: Getty Images. From 2024 to 2027, analysts expect SoundHound's revenue to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 48%. They also expect its adjustedearnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA)to turn positive by the final year. That's a promising growth trajectory, but it's still richly valued at 20 times this year's sales, so any bad news could easily sink its stock. Instead of investing in SoundHound AI, it might be smarter to invest in two other AI-oriented stocks that are on firmer ground:Arista Networks(ANET-2.17%)andMicron(MU-0.98%). Arista Networks is a top networking hardware and software company. But unlike itslarger competitor,Cisco, which locks in its customers with proprietary hardware and software, Arista uses off-the-shelf chips and open-source software that are compatible with a broad range of hardware. It also sells low-latency switches, optimized for hyperscale data center and cloud networks, and its CloudVision platform enables those clients to easily monitor their own cloud deployments. Arista's flexible, modular, and scalable strategy made it a top choice for cloud giants likeMeta PlatformsandMicrosoft. So, while Cisco might be a better one-stop shop for enterprise and campus customers, Arista is a more focused play on the booming cloud and AI infrastructure markets. From 2019 to 2024, Arista's revenue rose at a CAGR of 24%, while its adjusted net income increased at a CAGR of 30%. From 2024 to 2027, analysts expect its revenue and earnings per share (EPS) to grow at a CAGR of 19% and 15%, respectively. That growth should be driven by the soaring need for cloud and AI infrastructure upgrades, its gradual expansion into the enterprise and campus markets to challenge Cisco, and the rising adoption of its integrated security services. Arista's stock isn't cheap at 39 times this year's earnings, but it could still have plenty of room to grow. Micron is one of the world's largest producers of DRAM (dynamic random-access memory) and NAND memory chips. It controls smaller slices of both markets than South Korea'sSamsungand SK Hynix, but Micron manufactures slightly denser DRAM chips with its 1-beta process. That technological edge makes it a top choice for performance-oriented cloud and AI companies. Micron is a cyclical company that follows the memory market's boom and bust cycles. Its last bust occurred in 2023, when the PC market lapped its pandemic-driven acceleration, the 5G smartphone upgrade cycle cooled, and more data centers prioritized their purchases of Nvidia's AI-oriented graphics processing units (GPUs) over new memory chips. But from fiscal 2024 (which ended last August) to fiscal 2027, analysts expect Micron's revenue and EPS to grow at a CAGR of 23% and 148%, respectively. The company's growth is accelerating again as the PC and smartphone markets stabilize and more data center customers install solid-state drives (SSDs) and high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips to support the latest cloud and AI applications. That's an impressive growth trajectory for a stock that trades at just 13 times next year's earnings. Micron is likely trading at that lower valuation because it's a cyclical stock. However, it still has plenty of upside potential in this boom cycle as the cloud and AI markets generate fresh tailwinds for its business.",

        "header": "These Are the Best Stocks You Can Buy With $1,000 Right Now",
        "content": "The stock market has recovered nearly all the losses that were sparked by fear of a new trade war. The benchmarkS&P 500index finished June 25 less than a percentage point below its all-time high. Despite a big recovery for the overall stock market, several top tech stocks with a hand in the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution have been trading for attractive valuations. Demand for AI-related products hasn't translated into profits for the most popular large language model (LLM) providers, but sales of semiconductors and equipment required to produce those LLMs keep surging. Lately,Nvidia(NVDA1.74%),Lam Research(LRCX0.37%), andASML Holding(ASML-0.32%)have been trading at attractive valuations. If you have $1,000 -- or any amount -- available to invest in these stocks now, there's a good chance you'll realize market-beating gains over the long run. Image source: Getty Images. If you follow the AI space, you probably heard thatDeepSeek in ChinaignoredCUDA, Nvidia's software development kit (SDK), to produce a competitive LLM using inferior graphics processing units (GPUs).  The important thing for everyday investors to take from this event is that the vast majority of AI application developers aren't as capable and all but a handful of developers still rely on CUDA to build AI applications. Nvidia's software advantage allowed its fiscal first-quarter sales to surge 69% year over year to a whopping $44.1 billion. With demand for AI computing on the rise, and a software advantage that keeps competitors at bay, several more years of rapid growth isn't a wild expectation. On the surface, Nvidia stock looks expensive at 36 times earnings expectations. But once you consider how fast earnings are growing, the stock actually looks like a bargain right now. The forward price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio divides the trailing price-to-earnings ratio by the rate of earnings growth Wall Street expects in the year ahead. Anything below a 1.0 is considered undervalued, so Nvidia's recent forward PEG of 0.79 suggests now is a good time to buy. AMDandIntelare furiously trying to overcome Nvidia's software advantage. But even if they succeed, they'll still likely employ advanced etch and deposition equipment from Lam Research, a leader in the space. Now that advanced semiconductors are spacing nodes just a few nanometers apart, stacking semiconductor components is the way forward. As a leader in the verticalization processes, Lam Research could remain a vital equipment provider in the decade ahead. Its equipment is used to manufacture high bandwidth memory (HBM), which is an increasingly important component of AI processing. Strong demand from Nvidia helped Lam Research report first-quarter earnings that rose 12% year over year. Even if Nvidia unexpectedly loses its software advantage in the years ahead, the next leader in the semiconductor space will likely employ Lam's etch and deposition equipment to produce HBM, too. Shares of Lam Research have been trading for just 24 times earnings estimates. This valuation is extremely low for a highly profitable company that could continue raising earnings at double-digit percentages for many years to come. With $1,000, you could buy many shares of Nvidia or Lam Research. Advanced lithography system producer, ASML Holding is more than 25% off its previous peak, but you'll need at least $815 to buy one share at recent prices. (Don't get hung up on price, though. Price and value aren't the same thing, andfractional sharesare available.) Like Lam Research, ASML is a niche producer of semiconductor manufacturing equipment. Its enormous lithography machines contain hundreds of thousands of components and require months to ship and assemble. When it comes to advanced chips that AI applications rely on, an ASML lithography machine is the only option. ASML's already entrenched business requires heaps of capital, engineering knowledge, and relationships with semiconductor manufacturers. These sustainable advantages allowed earnings per share to rise by 16% annually over the past five years, and the gains could continue. At the midpoint of management's guided range, top-line sales are expected to climb by 14.8% this year. Without any competitors capable of marketing similar equipment, continued growth at a double-digit annual percentage seems likely. A stock market aware of ASML's competitive position rarely allows its stock price to fall into deep value territory. At recent prices, it's been trading for about 30 times forward-looking earnings expectations. This is a steep valuation, but it isn't one that ASML can't grow into. Adding some shares to a diversified portfolio to hold over the long run looks like a smart move for most growth-oriented investors right now.",

        "header": "Billionaire Philippe Laffont Sells Nvidia Stock and Buys an AI Stock Up 300% in 2025",
        "content": "Nvidia(NVDA1.74%)is the cornerstone of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, and Wall Street has a great deal of conviction in the semiconductor company. Among 65 analysts, the median target price is $175 per share. That implies 13% upside from its current share price of $155. Yet hedge fund manager Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management sold 1.4 million shares of Nvidia in the first quarter, reducing his stake by 15%. Meanwhile, the billionaire purchased 14.4 million shares ofCoreWeave(CRWV1.22%), an AI stock that has returned 300% since its IPO on March 28. Here's what investors should know about Nvidia and CoreWeave. Image source: Getty Images. Nvidia reported strong first-quarter financial results that beat expectations on the top and bottom lines. Sales rose 69% to $44 billion due to what CEO Jensen Huang called \"incredibly strong\" demand for AI infrastructure solutions. Meanwhile,non-GAAP(generally accepted accounting principles) earnings increased 33% to $0.81 per diluted share, and would have grown more quickly had it not been forexport restrictions. Looking ahead, investors have good reason to think Nvidia can maintain its momentum for several years to come. The company is not only the market leader in data centergraphics processing units(GPUs), chips used to accelerateartificial intelligence(AI) applications, but it also has booming networking and cloud services businesses built on growing demand for AI. That sets Nvidia up for strong sales growth through the end of the decade. Grand View Research estimates spending on AI hardware, software, and services will increase at 35% annually through 2030. Meanwhile, Wall Street expects Nvidia's adjusted earnings to grow at 40% annually through the fiscal year ending in January 2027. That makes the current valuation of 49 times adjusted earnings look fair. So, why did Philippe Laffont sell Nvidia? I think profit-taking factored into the decision. When he first bought the stock in Q3 2016, the average split-adjusted price was $1.47 per share. But the average price had risen 8,500% by Q1 2025. Regardless, it would be wrong to assume Laffont has lost confidence. Nvidia was still his eighth-largest holding at 4% of his portfolio as of March 31. I think Laffont has the right idea. Anyone sitting on monster gains can take some profits and reinvest that money elsewhere. At the same time, it makes sense to keep a modest position in Nvidia because the company has a strong presence in so many parts of the AI economy. Indeed, Angelo Zino at CFRA Research thinks Nvidia \"will be the most important company to our civilization over the next decade.\" CoreWeave provides infrastructure and software services purpose-built for AI workloads. The company is quite adept at managing GPU clusters. An internal study shows up to 20% better performance compared to other public clouds, and independent research company SemiAnalysis recently ranked it as the best AI cloud platform on the market. CoreWeave reported tremendous first-quarter financial results. Revenue climbed 420% to $981 million, and adjusted operating income (which eliminates stock-based compensation and interest payments) increased 550% to $162 million. However, the company reported a non-GAAP net loss of $150 million because interest payments cut deeply into profits. Building and maintaining data center infrastructure is costly, especially when the servers are built for AI. But CoreWeave has a responsible borrowing strategy: It only takes on debt when contracts create a need for additional capacity, and only if those contracts more than cover the cost of the debt. Management calls it \"naturally deleveraging self-amortizing debt.\" CoreWeave is well positioned to benefit as demand for AI infrastructure increases. The company said its revenue backlog increased 63% to $26 billion in the first quarter due in large part to a new deal with OpenAI. But its clientele also includes noteworthy technology companies likely to spend more on AI infrastructure in the years ahead, such asIBM,Meta Platforms,Microsoft, and Nvidia. Importantly, Philippe Laffont bought CoreWeave for about $40 per share because the company held its IPO on March 28, meaning it was only public for two trading days in the first quarter. Its share price ranged from $37 to $40 during that period. CoreWeave has since quadrupled in value, and the stock now trades at 29 times sales, a very expensive valuation. For context, only three companies in theS&P 500(^GSPC0.52%)currently have price-to-sales ratios above 29. So, investors should be cautious. I think it's OK to buy a small position today, but I would wait for the stock to get cheaper before building a large position.",

        "header": "What Are 5 AI Stocks Growing Revenue by 30% or More to Buy Right Now?",
        "content": "Make no mistake, investors love revenue growth, and investing in companies that are growing their top lines quickly can be quite rewarding. Nvidia(NVDA1.74%),Advanced Micro Devices(AMD0.05%), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(TSM2.02%),Palantir Technologies(PLTR-9.04%), andSoundHound AI(SOUN-0.91%)have all been achieving revenue growth of 30% or more recently, and they're all among the best stocks to buy right now. Let's take a closer look. Image source: Getty Images Nvidia has delivered explosive revenue growth over the past few years and there are no signs of that letting up. In its fiscal 2026 first quarter, the company grew revenue by 69% year over year to $44.1 billion as data center revenue soared by 73% to $39.1 billion. Even more impressively, the company's data center sales were up by more than 800% compared to its fiscal 2024 first quarter, when they were just $4.3 billion. The chipmaker's growth is being powered by theartificial intelligence (AI)infrastructure build-out. Itsgraphics processing units (GPUs)have become the most widely used chips for providing the parallel processing muscle that AI model training andinferencerequire. However, the company'sCUDAsoftware platform -- which allows developers to program its GPUs for specific tasks and increase processing speeds --\u00a0has provided another wide moat around its business. Nvidia's previous efforts led to many developers integrating CUDA into early high-performance computing work, and the company later built a collection of tools and libraries to help enhance the performance of its chips for these tasks. But the platform and its tools can only be used with Nvidia chips, which has helped the company preserve its dominant market share in the GPU space and continues to set it up for strong growth ahead. While AMD is a distant second to Nvidia in the GPU market, it nonetheless has been seeing strong sales growth. Last quarter, AMD's revenue jumped 36% year over year to $7.4 billion, while its data center revenue climbed 57% to $3.7 billion. The company has established itself as a leading maker ofcentral processing units (CPUs)for data centers, and it has been taking market share in that niche. Meanwhile, it has been carving out a niche for its GPUs in the AI inference market. In its most recent quarterly report, AMD noted that one of the largest AI model companies was handling a significant portion of its daily inference traffic using AMD's chips. This is important for AMD, as the AI inference market is predicted to grow to a much larger size than the AI model training segment. Inference is not as technically demanding as training, and chip costs come much more into play, which helps negate some of Nvidia's CUDA advantage. This opens the door for AMD to take some GPU market share in the future. While Nvidia and AMD design the chips that are helping power the AI revolution, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is the company that physically produces most of them. This has led to tremendous growth for TSMC: Its revenue jumped by 35% year over year in Q1 to $25.5 billion. The AI infrastructure build-out has been the biggest driver of TSMC's growth recently as it continues to increase manufacturing capacity to meet surging demand. Last quarter, high-performance computing accounted for 59% of its revenue. Because its operations are integral to the high-end chip space -- the company has the greatest technical expertise and scale of any foundry -- it has also been able to raise prices. This has resulted in solidgross marginimprovements, including a 190 basis point increase last quarter to 58.8%. TSMC's position as an invaluable part of the semiconductor supply chain sets it up for continued strong growth in the years ahead. Best of all, it won't matter which chip designers come out on top -- it'll be a winner regardless. Palantir's revenue growth has been accelerating in recent quarters, culminating in a 39% jump in Q1 to $883.9 million. A large share of that growth is coming from its U.S. commercial segment as businesses adopt the Palantir Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) as a tool to solve real-world problems. Meanwhile, the company is also seeing strong sales growth with its largest customer, the U.S. government. In Q1, its U.S. commercial segment revenue surged 71% to $244 million, while its U.S. government revenue climbed 45% to $373 million. The exciting thing about Palantir is that it's quickly adding commercial customers. This has the potential to be a big growth driver as these customers expand their use of the company's solutions over time. In addition, AIP is being used to solve a wide array of problems across industries, from helping monitor sepsis in hospitals to underwriting insurance. The huge number of use cases to which AIP can be applied represents a huge opportunity for Palantir, which should lead to years of strong revenue growth ahead. SoundHound AI is currently in hypergrowth mode: Its revenue has climbed by 50% or more year over year in each of the past seven quarters. Last quarter, its revenue surged by a whopping 151% to $29.1 million. The company has made strong inroads with customers in the automotive industry and is beginning to benefit as carmakers shift away from partnering with big tech companies for their in-vehicle voice-recognition technology. SoundHound AI also continues to make progress in the restaurant space, while its recent acquisition of Amelia has given it strong positions in other verticals such as healthcare, financial services, and retail. While its revenue growth has already been surging, the company's biggest opportunity ahead lies in agentic AI. It recently launched its Amelia 7.0 platform, which includes AI agents that can perform tasks without the need for human intervention. If SoundHound AI can use this as a launchpad toward becoming more widely used as the voice layer of agentic AI, then it should continue to see strong revenue growth for many years.",

        "content": "WhileAmazon(AMZN2.66%)stock has shown strength of late, it has actually been one of the laggards among the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks since the end of the pandemic. Amazon's stock is only about 15% higher than it was at its pandemic peak in late 2021. However, the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution is unlocking a lot of new growth possibilities for the e-commerce and cloud giant. In fact, CEO Andy Jassy recently sent a letter to employees this month outlining how AI istransforming every aspect of Amazon's empire. On that note, here are three exciting new growth initiatives for Amazon shareholders to look forward to over the next year. Though Amazon is practically a conglomerate today, its original business and backbone is e-commerce. And what separates Amazon from the pack is its convenience -- items delivered fast to your door, in a price-competitive fashion. Amazon has continually cemented its lead by investing in faster delivery times under its Prime subscription, first offering two-day delivery on many items, then investing in one-day shipping starting in 2019, and then eventually same-day shipping. Delivering a critical mass of items fast is really hard to do. But never satisfied, Amazon recently said it will soon push its limits even further. This past week, Amazon announced it would be expanding its one- and same-day delivery to more rural communities and small U.S. towns, with a pledge to spend $4 billion through 2026 to triple its delivery network in those areas. The move not only looks to expand Amazon's total addressable market, but also takes the competition toWalmartand dollar stores on their home turf. Amazon's North American revenue grew 7.6% last quarter, which of course includes advertising, physical stores, and third-party sellers. Still, it's the e-commerce arm that helps funnel all those revenue streams, so investors should keep a lookout to see if Amazon's rural initiatives help sustain that solid growth. Going from Amazon's oldest business to its newest, the ambitious Project Kuiper could start to generate revenues beginning in late 2025. Project Kuiper is Amazon's satellite-based broadband venture, and has been in the works for at least six years. However, things are starting to get interesting on this front, with Kuiper just having launched its first 27 satellites on April 28, on its way to a total of 3,236 when all is said and done. By July 2026, Amazon expects to have half that total in orbit. Image source: Getty Images. Still, it won't be that long before Amazon sees Kuiper revenues, with Amazon saying it expects to start commercial service sometime in late 2025. Kuiper has stated it could offer speeds up to 400 megabits per second for consumers, and up to 1 gigabit per second to commercial customers. That's faster than Elon Musk's Starlink, which offers 25 to 100 mbps speeds on standard plans. While the venture isn't on many investors' radars right now, CEO Andy Jassy has been excited about Kuiper and believes it can be a strong third leg of profits for Amazon, in addition to e-commerce and cloud computing. Artificial intelligence is all the rage right now, but it's quite difficult to know which large company will be the winner: a large Magnificent Seven name, or an upstart likeOpenAI? Amazon is competing in AI with the same strategy it has applied to other businesses -- offering the largest breadth of customer choice through itsAmazon Bedrockplatform, while also driving down costs throughvertical integrationin order to become the largest-scale, lowest-cost provider of AI services. Driving down costs starts with semiconductors, and while the first-mover leading AI chipmaker is obviouslyNvidia, given how expensive Nvidia's high-priced chips are, all cloud giants are now investing in their own custom AI chips. Amazon has been a leader on that front, having purchased chipmaker Annapurna Labs back in 2015 for just $350 million -- a deal that looks like an absolute bargain today, given how important custom chips are now for all major tech giants. Over the past decade, Amazon developed its own Graviton processors for low-cost cloud workloads. And when AI took off, Amazon developed its own AI chip called Trainium. While not as powerful as the latest Nvidia chip, Trainium also costs a lot less, with Amazon maintaining that Trainium 2's price performance exceeds that of Nvidia's by about 40%. In fact, AI LLM company Anthropic, an OpenAI rival in which Amazon has invested billions, built its latest and greatest Claude 4 models completely on Trainium, not Nvidia. Having trained one of today's most capable models is a pretty big milestone for Amazon's chip. In late 2025, Trainium 3 will come to market on AWS, with Amazon forecasting a whopping 50% increase in performance compared to Trainium 2. CEO Andy Jassy has said AI has the potential to drive revenues beyond the \"multi-hundred billions\" originally contemplated forAmazon Web Services, which generated $112 billion over the past 12 months. Look for Amazon's latest Trainium chip to be instrumental on that front in 2026 and beyond.",

Beijing denies this, but many U.S. lawmakers remain skeptical. According to O'Leary, a new sale involving TikTok's existing algorithm is no longer on the table. \"We know that we can\u2019t buy the algorithm,\" he said in a video heposted to X. \"So we're gonna have to rewrite this whole thing.\" O'Leary is part of a group led by billionaireFrank McCourtand Reddit co-founderAlexis Ohanianproposing a new version of TikTok \u2014 one without Chinese-owned code. Their goal? Create a U.S.-based platform that puts data ownership in the hands of users, not corporations. The alternative, O'Leary warns, is a legal minefield. \"Every mothers' group and state attorney general is suing social media,\" he said. \"All stemming from the fact that the platform owns the data and the customer doesn\u2019t.\" Trending: Tired of Grid Failures and Charging Deserts? This Startup Has a Solar Fix and $25M+ in Sales \u2014Now Raising at $3/Share O'Leary also tied the TikTok debate to the broader issue of U.S. technology exports, especially AI chips made by companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). He used a bee analogy to explain: The chip is the queen bee, and software developers are the honeybees building AI \u2014 or \"honey\" \u2014 on that chip. O'Leary argued there will soon be only two types of AI: \"American honey\" and \"Chinese honey.\" \"If you want the world running on Chinese honey, stop shipping American queen bee chips,\" he said. His point: limiting chip exports could backfire by encouraging foreign adversaries to build their own alternatives \u2014 like TikTok.

Unless Congress acts or a new buyer is found, TikTok could be pulled from U.S. app stores after the September deadline. O'Leary believes this is likely the \"last extension.\" As lawmakers debate national security,global trade, and personal privacy, the clock keeps ticking. One thing is clear: TikTok's fate is tied not just to politics, but to a fundamental question about the future of the internet \u2014 who controls the data, and who gets to decide?

        "content": "Despite strong gains for the broader market,CoreWeave(CRWV1.21%)stock closed out this week's trading down by double digits. Theartificial intelligence (AI)specialist's share price fell 12.8% over the stretch. Meanwhile, theS&P 500index rose 3.4%. CoreWeave stock lost ground this week following fresh analyst coverage and news thatNvidia(NVDA1.74%)is making a bigger push in the cloud computing space. The company's valuation was also pressured by reports that a big acquisition move could be in the works. Image source: Getty Images. Before the market opened on Wednesday, H.C. Wainwright published its first rating on CoreWeave. The investment firm set a neutral rating on the tech specialist's stock, with analyst Kevin Dede raising some valuation concerns despite also acknowledging that CoreWeave had demonstrated its computing strengths. The Wall Street Journalalso published a report on Wednesday stating that Nvidia plans to ramp up its own cloud-computing business. Nvidia's advancedgraphics processing units (GPUs)have been the key hardware at the center of the AI data center revolution, but the tech leader is also in the relatively early stages of building its own AI-as-a-service (AIaaS) business. The company is a financial backer of CoreWeave, but some investors are worried that the tech giant could move in on the smaller player's turf. On Thursday,WSJreported that CoreWeave is negotiating a deal to acquireCore Scientific(CORZ1.53%). According to the report, a buyout could be finalized within weeks and is expected to assign a Core Scientific substantial valuation premium. Based on subsequent trading for CoreWeave, the reaction from investors appears to be mixed. Analysts are also split on what the buyout valuation might look like. Jeffries put forward a lower-end target, estimating that CoreWeave could pay between $16 per share and $23 per share to purchase Core Scientific. Cantor Fitzgerald put the potential buyout price at above $30 per share, and Roth Capital expects the company could pay as much as $38 per share in an all-stock deal. Given that CoreWeave tried to acquire Core Scientific at a price of $5.75 per share last year, some investors may be worried that the company is at risk of overpaying in the potential buyout.",

        "header": "Down 48%, Should You Buy the Dip on Rigetti Computing?",
        "content": "Quantum computingspecialistRigetti Computing(RGTI-0.18%)soared sky-high at the end of 2024, but gave back a lot of those gains in the first half of 2025. On June 25, the stock is trading 48% below January's peak prices. Will Rigetti's stock get a second wind someday soon, or could the price chart continue its retreat? Let's find out. Image source: Getty Images. Rigetti is no spring chicken. The company was founded in 2013 and delivered its first quantum computing services in the cloud four years later. Its systems rely on superconducting materials cooled nearly to absolute zero. It's a proven approach, but also a costly one with specialized materials managed by massive super-cooling machinery. Nobody expectsquantum computersto take over every data-crunching task, even in the long run. Rigetti proposes a hybrid approach where digital computers continue to be the workhorses of everyday computing needs, but with the option to tap into quantum computers for certain workloads. So the company develops solutions across this stack of technologies, from quantum chips and systems to the old-school software that assigns quantum jobs and reads the results. Rigetti's management sees a huge long-term market in this integrated system philosophy. Last summer, management said that \"practical quantum computing is poised to happen in the next few years and have significant commercial potential.\" A significant breakthrough in quantum computing error correction arrived five months later. Rigetti's stock soared from roughly $1 to more than $21 per share in five weeks, as investors saw a quick route to commercial applications. But the huge gains didn't last. Jensen Huang, the CEO of semiconductor giant (and quantum-to-digital software developer)Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA)said that practical quantum systems could be 20 years away. Huang tried to backtrack from that statement, but the market-moving effects held firm anyway. At this point, Wall Street seems to have settled on a compromise between Rigetti's quick plans and Nvidia's long-term view. Despite losing approximately half of its peak gains, Rigetti's stock is still up tenfold over the last year. Unfortunately, Rigetti runs an expensive business model with minimal sales and deep financial losses. The company reported $10.8 million of revenue in 2024, down from $12 million in 2023. Net losses nearly tripled in the same time span, from $75 million to $201 million. The soaring stock price played a large part in the loss calculations, as the fair value of Rigetti's stock-based financial instruments soared. That's a taxable expense. And of course, Rigetti spent $50 million on research and development plus $24 million on selling, general, and administrative expenses -- again, based on $10 million in full-year sales. Furthermore, Rigetti isn't the only name in the quantum computing game. The game-changing error correction that sparked last year's boom? That was an achievement from Google Quantum AI, a group in theAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL)tech empire. Rigetti lists Google,IBM(NYSE: IBM), and the Chinese government as direct rivals using similar superconducting techniques. And you already know that Nvidia competes with Rigetti's digital-to-quantum control and reporting software. This small and cash-burning company faces challenges from some of the largest, richest, and most innovative companies in the world. Rigetti keeps the lights on by selling more stock, sometimes on the open market and sometimes in direct offerings to private investors. It's an effective cash-raising strategy, but Rigetti's existing investors seemassive dilutionalong the way. The share count is up by 61.7% over the last year:  RGTI Shares Outstandingdata byYCharts Rigetti's stock returns took some damage from dilution, but the chart above still shows a 52-week return of more than 1,100%. Cry me a river, right? That's great as long as the stock is soaring, but Rigetti's share price often shows big drops between the sudden jumps. Go back to June 2024 and look at the two-year chart at that point. You'll see a very different story:  RGTI Shares Outstandingdata byYCharts The stock sales continued while share prices dropped 76% lower. I expect Rigetti to continue raising cash on the open market, no matter where the chart is going next. Based on the company's unprofitable operations, lofty valuation, and well-heeled rivals, investors are probably looking at another lengthy downturn.",

        "content": "The smaller the circle, the harder it is to get inside it. One of the most exclusive circles of all is what some investment writers (including me) call the \"$2 trillion club.\" To be a member, a company must have a market cap of at least $2 trillion. If a company has its sights set on gaining admission to the $2 trillion club, focusing on artificial intelligence (AI) is probably a smart move. All five of the current members invest heavily in AI. And two AI stocks are the most likely contenders to join the club next. Image source: Getty Images. Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT)andNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA)have jockeyed back and forth to be the largest company in the world. Nvidia currently holds the title, with a market cap of nearly $3.8 trillion. Microsoft is breathing down Nvidia's neck, though, with a market cap of nearly $3.7 trillion. Both companies are leaders in the AI arena. Nvidia'sgraphics processing units (GPUs)remain the gold standard to power servers used to build and deploy AI models. Microsoft's integration with OpenAI's GPT throughout its product suite and cloud platform has been a game-changer for the tech giant. For years,Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL)reigned as the world's biggest company. However, the iPhone maker now holds the No. 3 spot, with a market cap of a little over $3 trillion. While Apple has significant AI expertise, its perceived slowness in rolling outgenerative AI (genAI)capabilities, along with the lackluster response to the genAI functionality it ultimately did launch, has allowed Nvidia and Microsoft to leapfrog it. Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN)claims the No. 4 position, with a market cap of nearly $2.3 trillion. The e-commerce leader is also the cloud services leader, with Amazon Web Services (AWS) commanding a significant advantage in market share among cloud services providers. AWS' AI offerings have helped it stay at the top, even with other cloud companies gaining ground. One of those rising cloud stars is Google parentAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL). Google Cloud is the fastest-growing major cloud service provider. Google Search has also introduced generative AI functionality, such as AI Overviews and AI Mode. In addition, Alphabet's Waymo unit is the leader in autonomous ride-hailing, which relies heavily on AI. The two companies that trail behind Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and Alphabet are also, not so coincidentally, AI leaders. Both are the clear favorites at this point to be the next members of the $2 trillion club. Meta Platforms(META1.04%)is already knocking at the door, with its market cap approaching $1.8 trillion. All the stock needs is a gain of 23.5% or so to take its place alongside the other five AI stocks. That might not prove to be too difficult. Meta's shares are up more than 20% year to date. Some have criticized Meta's AI efforts. However, the company is using AI extensively internally to recommend content to users of its apps and help advertisers. Its Meta AIlarge language model (LLM)has almost 1 billion active monthly users. Meta is also a leader in AI-powered smart glasses. Broadcom(AVGO-0.30%)has a steeper climb than Meta does to join the $2 trillion club. With a market cap of $1.24 trillion, the chipmaker's share price would have to jump by more than 60% to become a member. Broadcom stock has risen around 14% so far in 2025. AI networking presents a tremendous growth opportunity for Broadcom. Its AI revenue soared 46% year over year to $4.4 billion in the second quarter of 2025, with AI networking making up 40% of the total. Broadcom CEO Hock Tan said on the company's fiscal Q2 earnings call that he expects the demand for AI accelerators to increase in the coming quarters. I think both of these prospective $2 trillion club members are smart picks for long-term investors to buy now. Granted, Meta and Broadcom could be volatile over the near term. Meta faces some regulatory issues in Europe. Broadcom's valuation is sky-high, with shares trading at more than 40 times forward earnings. If you're patient, though, I expect both companies to continue to benefit from major AI tailwinds.",

        "header": "Where Will Nvidia Stock Be in 10 Years?",
        "content": "Technology companies must constantly evolve to stay relevant. AndNvidia(NVDA1.74%)is no stranger to this phenomenon. Founded in 1993, the legendary chipmaker first made its name in video game graphics, eventually getting a notable boost from cryptocurrency mining before its big break with the arrival of generative AI in late 2022. Now, Nvidia's data center business (where it sells AI chips) represents 89% of its $44.1 billion in total revenue, while the once-core gaming segment represents just under 9%. But this is not the time for management to rest on its laurels. There are already signs that its AI chip business could be slowing. And over the next decade, a transition to new business verticals could be key to the company's success. The start of a new megatrend will often see a flurry of capital spending as hardware improves rapidly and companies throw caution to the wind to avoid falling behind their rivals. But eventually, the technological improvement will slow down, competition will increase, and margins will start to decline. The networking hardware companyCisco Systemsexperienced this duringthe dot-com bubble. Shares have still never surpassed their all-time high reached in 2000. So far, there is no sign that Nvidia is on the cusp of crashing likeCisco. With aforward price-to-earnings multiple(P/E) of just 34, its valuation remains very reasonable, considering its growth rate. For context, theS&P 500averages a P/E of 29. However, there are some early signs that its generative AI hardware business might be starting to cool. The company's revenue growth has decelerated to 69% (down from 262% last fiscal quarter). And while this may have something to do with the recent ban on chip exports to China, the bigger story may be that its customers are increasingly turning to in-house solutions for their AI hardware needs. The good news is that Nvidia has several promising new verticals that could help diversify its revenue streams over the next decade. Nvidia's expertise in designing and producing cutting-edge computer chips will give it an advantage in opportunities outside of just generative AI. Robotics andself-driving carscould be the next big thing. For example, Tesla has already made extensive use of Nvidia's chips to create its supercomputer Dojo, which supports the training of its humanoid robots and self-driving taxis. The latter program began commercial operations in Austin, Texas, this month. While it is unclear how these businesses will perform over the long term, they have epic potential. Image source: Getty Images. Analysts at McKinsey believe self-driving technology could generate $300 billion to $400 billion in annual revenue by 2035, whileGoldman Sachsestimates the humanoid robot opportunity could hit $38 billion by that time. Nvidia's automation and robotics segment has already started to pick up, with first-quarter sales jumping 72% year over year to $567 million. Long-term investing is generally the key to sustainable returns in the stock market. But when your time horizon expands from years to decades, some unexpected risks can emerge. According to Ernst & Young, the average U.S.S&P 500company has a lifespan of just 15 years because of technological disruption and failure to adapt to changing conditions. Many others experience long periods of stagnation, even if they survive. Nvidia can maintain a dominant position because of its vast scale andcompetitive moatin advanced computer hardware design. These industries will probably exist for the foreseeable future. But whether or not it continues to thrive will depend on how well its management can execute long-term pivots to new technology verticals as the generative AI opportunity continues to mature and potentially slow down.",

        "header": "With a $3.8 Trillion Market Cap, Does Nvidia Really Still Have Room to Grow?",
        "content": "Nvidia(NVDA1.74%)is the largest publicly traded company, with amarket capof about $3.8 trillion on Friday afternoon, and a stock price that's just below its all-time high. Nvidia's growth story has been nothing short of extraordinary. Revenue has grown by nearly 400% over the past two years as AI investment activity has exploded, and that's after an already extremely impressive multidecade history. If you don't already ownNvidia, is it too late to invest? With an estimated 95% share of its most important end markets and nearly $150 billion in revenue over the past four quarters, it's easy to understand why Nvidia's upside from here might appear limited. But I'd argue the opposite. Not only do I think Nvidia's revenue could get much larger from here, but the stock could produce market-beating returns for many years to come. Image source: Getty Images. Nvidia has four main business segments: data center, gaming, professional visualization, and automotive. The data center segment is by far the most important. In simple terms, AI-focused applications require a tremendous amount of data processing ability, and Nvidia's data center accelerator products are widely considered to be the gold standard. As mentioned, the company has a dominant (estimated) 95% market share.\u00a0And the industry itself is growing rapidly. Over the past year, Nvidia's data center segment sales tripled, and the $120 billion global market for data center accelerators is expected to roughly double over the next five years.Data centercapital spending -- mostly by large tech companies -- is expected to reach $1 trillion annually in just three years, compared to $500 billion today. In other words, if Nvidia simply maintains its dominant market share, the largest and most critical part of its business could double or more in size by 2030. The company's other segments have lots of room to grow as well. The automotive segment is a big opportunity, as advanced autonomous vehicle technology is still in the early stages of evolution, and Nvidia already has 20 of the top 30 EV manufacturers on its customer roster. In fact, GPUs for automotive applications is expected to be a $45 billion market by 2030, and Nvidia also develops software systems, safety systems, and more for automotive applications. Nvidia's free cash flow hasn't been anywhere near the current level for long, but now that the company is generating boatloads of cash, management is allocating it in shareholder-friendly ways. The company does pay a quarterly dividend, but it's a minuscule one (0.03% yield), at least for now. But buybacks are becoming an increasingly large focus of management. In the first quarter, Nvidia spent more than $14 billion on stockbuybacks, which was more than half of the company's free cash flow. However, keep in mind that Nvidia's free cash flow grew by 75% year over year, and is expected to grow rapidly for at least the next few years, so it wouldn't be surprising to see buybacks expand along with it. Finally, Nvidia isnota cheap stock, trading at 48 times trailing 12-month earnings and about 34 times sales. But it isn't necessarily an expensive one. Nvidia's revenue growth (both past and projected) clearly justifies a higher P/E ratio. Analyst estimates call for 44% year-over-year earnings growth in the current fiscal year (ending January 2026) and another 34% in the following year. Plus, the combination of this growth rate and Nvidia's stellar margins (net margin over 50%) warrant an elevated price-to-sales multiple. In fact, by some popular metrics, such as the price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio, Nvidia stock looks rather attractive right now. The bottom line is that a combination of a growing market opportunity, shareholder-friendly capital allocation, and a reasonable valuation could allow Nvidia to continue to grow and produce excellent returns for years to come.",

Individual stocks within the Magnificent 7, however, would have multiplied your money exponentially. Nvidia, for example, single-handedly blew away thereturns of both the S&P 500and the other stocks within the Magnificent 7, returning a massive 891%. If you had invested $100,000 in Nvidia at the end of 2022, you\u2019d be sitting on a nearly $1 million portfolio in just 2 1/2 years. The bottom line is that yes, investing any amount of money in the Magnificent 7 stocks at the start of 2023 would have earned you considerable gains. While some analysts are predicting more gains ahead, bear in mind that to earn these types of returns, you have totake on considerable risk. In 2022, for example, the Magnificent 7 stocks dropped 40% as a whole, with some of its individual components losing more than 65% of their value. As high reward comes with high risk, be sure that investing in the Magnificent 7 stocks matches up with your financial objectives and risk tolerance.

        "header": "Will This \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock Overtake Microsoft and Nvidia As the Largest Company in the World By 2030?",
        "content": "WhileNvidiaandMicrosoftare duking it out to see which company will maintain its position as the largest in the world by market cap, another competitor is lurking in the background:Amazon(AMZN2.66%). Amazon is a dark horse pick to become the largest company in the world in a few years, because it has several divisions that are growing at an impressive rate while producing stellar profits. But does it have enough juice to overtake the current leaders by 2030? Let's take a look. Image source: Getty Images. Amazon is more than just the e-commerce platform you interact with when shopping. There is a lot that goes into selling products online, as well as delivering them to your doorstep, but none of those aspects excite me about the stock. Instead, I'm most interested in the company's advertising and cloud computing segments. Its advertising wing was nearly nonexistent five years ago. Now, it has grown into its fourth-largest segment, behind online stores, third-party seller services, and Amazon Web Services (AWS). It's also the fastest-growing segment, with revenue rising 18% in the first quarter. The company has some of the most valuable consumer data available, like direct information about shopping habits. This makes its ad data incredibly powerful, which is why management was smart to monetize it. Another reason this segment is so important is its increased margins. The company doesn't break down the margins of its individual operations, and advertising gets grouped into Amazon's North American and International commerce segments. But from examining advertising-focused businesses likeMeta Platforms, it's clear that this division likely has an incredibly high operating margin. This is crucial for Amazon's future because the faster growth of higher-margin segments will allow profits to increase rapidly. This same dynamic is occurring in AWS'cloud computing segment,which is benefiting from two major trends: a general migration from on-premises to cloud-based solutions and the increasing adoption of AI workloads. Both of these create huge growth catalysts for AWS and are why it produced solid 17% growth in the first quarter. Fortunately for investors, Amazon breaks out its margins. In the first quarter, AWS' operating margin was an impressive 39%. Although it accounted for 19% of overall revenue, it contributed 63% of the company's total operating profits. As long as AWS continues to deliver rapid growth, Amazon's profits will rise much faster than its overall revenue, which is what we've seen play out over the past few years with the stock, although that trend is starting to slow somewhat.  AMZN Operating Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth)data byYCharts; YoY = year over year. Although itsoperating profit growthisn't as rapid as it once was, it's still delivering a healthy amount of growth. But is that enough to propel it to the top spot by 2030? It's unlikely that Amazon will see a rapid growth catalyst over the next five years different from what's currently happening, so the high-single-digit revenue growth and 20% or so increase in operating profit are reasonable expectations for investors. And the stock is valued around the same level as Microsoft and Nvidia, so it doesn't have an argument for seeing itsprice-to-forward-earnings multipleincrease over the next few years, either.  NVDA PE Ratio (Forward)data byYCharts; PE = price to earnings. As a result, I don't think Amazon's 20% or so operating profit growth will enable it to surpass Nvidia, which is rising at a significantly faster rate. However, it could allow Amazon to catch Microsoft, which is growing by the low double digits. Regardless, I believe Amazon is an excellent investment,and it will likely deliver market-beating returns over the next five years, driven by its solid profit growth.",

        "header": "This Dark-Horse AI Stock Has Doubled Since April, and It Still Looks Like a Buy",
        "content": "By now, investors are well aware of the big winners in artificial intelligence (AI): stocks likeNvidiaandPalantirthat have already delivered huge returns for early investors. However, there are plenty of winners in AI, and some of them have been more overlooked than others. One stock that still seems undervalued even after doubling since the market dip in April isMicron Technology(MU-0.98%), a leading maker of memory chips, including high-bandwidth chips that are used for AI applications. Micron is also an integrated device manufacturer, meaning it both designs and manufactures its own chips, differentiating it from companies like Nvidia,Broadcom, andAdvanced Micro Devices. That exposes the company to added volatility due to the cyclical nature of thesemiconductor industry, but it also gives the stock more upside in good times because it can fully capture the benefit of the AI boom. Coming into the company's fiscal third-quarter earnings report, the stock had been rallying alongside the rest of the tech sector as concerns about tariffs and a recession have faded since President Donald Trump announced the \"Liberation Day\" tariffs and later paused them. Micron did not disappoint. Image source: Getty Images. The momentum continued in the third quarter as revenue rose 37% to $9.3 billion, and gross profit nearly doubled from $1.83 billion to $3.5 billion as gross margin expanded from 26.9% to 37.7%. That shows the company is benefiting from increased efficiencies as more of its business shifts to the data center sector, much of which is AI, and high-bandwidth memory (HBM). Management noted that HBM revenue grew nearly 50% sequentially, and data center revenue more than doubled on a year-over-year basis to a quarterly record. The company also recorded an all-time high in revenue for DRAM (dynamic random-access memory), which includes HBM revenue. And 55% of its revenue came from data center and networking sales, up from 30% a year ago. On the bottom line, Micron's performance also continued to improve with expanding margins as adjusted earnings per share (EPS) jumped from $0.30 to $1.68, and operating margin surged form 10.6% a year ago to 23.3%. Again, that figure improved sequentially, rising from 22% to 23.3%, a favorable sign. The company easily beat estimates on the top and bottom lines, and the stock initially jumped on the results after hours, but then it pulled back as the company revealed that prices were down for some of its chips. Nonetheless, guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter, its biggest of the year, was strong as well. The company expects revenue of $10.4 billion to $11 billion, up 38% from a year ago, and adjusted EPS of $2.35 to $2.65, up from $1.18 in the quarter a year ago. Following the earnings report and updated guidance, Micron trades at a forward P/E of about 16, a substantial discount to theS&P 500and its chip stock peers. Analysts also see earnings continuing to ramp up into fiscal 2026, forecasting adjusted EPS of $12 next year. If those forecasts are correct, the stock certainly looks like a buy. The aforementioned pricing concerns seem to have led to a modest sell-off in the stock on Thursday following the earnings report, but the company looks well positioned to continue to benefit from growth in AI. Its biggest customer is now Nvidia, and the relationship between the two companies seems to be getting stronger. Micron was invited to present its portfolio of data center memory and storage products at Nvidia's GTC conference in March. It is also the only manufacturer of advanced memory chips in the U.S., making it a strategically important company, and it was awarded $6.2 billion to build new plants in the U.S. Those factors, along with what appears to be a lasting tailwind in AI, should drive the company's growth for the foreseeable future. While Micron will experience another cyclical rotation at some point, it looks like an attractive buy at the current valuation.",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) \u2014 Traders keen to seize on further gains after the S&P 500 Index hit its first record since February are betting on stock-market darlings that they expect will surpass the index\u2019s ascent. Most Read from Bloomberg Philadelphia Transit System Votes to Cut Service by 45%, Hike Fares Squeezed by Crowds, the Roads of Central Park Are Being Reimagined Sao Paulo Pushes Out Favela Residents, Drug Users to Revive Its City Center Sprawl Is Still Not the Answer Mapping the Architectural History of New York\u2019s Chinatown The signals from derivatives trading are clear, strategists said, as investors last week aggressively bought call options \u2014 a wager that an asset\u2019s price will keep increasing. Among the highlights: a rush into Nvidia Corp. on Wednesday that pushed the volume of call contracts on the stock to almost triple that of bearish puts, the biggest gap since January; a jump to a four-month high in the call-put ratio on the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund; and a drop to a two-month low in the cost of hedging against a selloff in Meta Platforms Inc. (META). To Chris Murphy, co-head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna International Group, the risk-on behavior has been fueled by a growing fear of missing out on a rally that seems impervious to strife in the Middle East and concern that the US economy and corporate earnings growth are slowing. In addition to Nvidia (NVDA), he said there was strong call buying last week in momentum names like Uber Technologies Inc. (UBER), Tesla Inc. (TSLA) and Robinhood Markets Inc. (HOOD) The \u201cweek\u2019s options flow reflects clear signs of FOMO-driven re-risking,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cThe trend is clear, with almost exclusively bullish flow, momentum call buying, as well as buy-the-dip put selling.\u201d Optimism that the US is moving closer to reaching concrete deals with its major trading partners drove stocks to a record. The demand to seek protection for a decline in the largest fund tracking the S&P 500 (^GSPC) has decreased rapidly in the past week, a move that typically implies building euphoria. At the same time, traders are also confronting mixed signals. On Friday, US stocks nosedived in afternoon trading after Trump said he was ending all trade talks with Canada and threatened to impose a fresh tariff rate within the next week. They eventually recouped the losses and closed at an all-time high. Earlier on Friday, Bank of America Corp. (BAC) strategists warned of the increasing risk of a speculative stock-market bubble as traders drive massive flows into equities on expectations of US interest-rate cuts. The upcoming earnings season could also test the foundation of the recent rally, especially with lackluster forecasts piling in. In a macro environment as uncertain as the current one, the possibility of more setbacks, like the souring of negotiations with Canada, are also immensely higher. It is also why Susquehanna\u2019s Murphy said using call options is a preferred way for investors to chase speculative rallies. It allows them to limit the size of their losses and positions them to benefit from any gains. Calls give traders the right to buy a stock at a future higher price, but does not obligate them to, which means if the bet fails, the most they lose is the premium they paid for that right. There is further evidence that traders are crowding into the riskiest stocks seeking the sharpest upside so they don\u2019t miss out on further gains. The Invesco S&P 500 High Beta ETF, which tracks highly volatile stocks, is on track for its best quarter since 2020 relative to the Invesco S&P 500 Low Volatility ETF. A Goldman basket of most-shorted stocks is on pace for the best monthly gain since February 2024. Retail investors are diving into equities, according to data from JPMorgan, which is often a sign of risk-taking as a stock rally intensifies. There\u2019s also a willingness to chase asset prices higher, with the call skew \u2014 a measure of how much traders are willing to pay for bullish exposure \u2014 steepening on several speculative names such as Tesla, the ARK Innovation ETF and Coinbase Global Inc. during the week. Tom Keen, options trader at Piper Sandler & Co., said the pick up in call-option volumes and a firming of the implied volatility in call options both point to a FOMO-rush. \u201cWe are coming into summer where seemingly macro risks are moving lower, there is lower realized volatility at the moment, and many were not expecting the strength in price action we have seen as of late,\u201d Keen said. So while risks persist \u2014 especially with tariff deadlines looming \u2014 traders see \u201ccatalysts they want to be constructive on.\u201d Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek America\u2019s Top Consumer-Sentiment Economist Is Worried How to Steal a House Inside Gap\u2019s Last-Ditch, Tariff-Addled Turnaround Push Apple Test-Drives Big-Screen Movie Strategy With F1 Does a Mamdani Victory and Bezos Blowback Mean Billionaires Beware? \u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.

        "header": "3 No-Brainer Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "It looks likeartificial intelligence (AI)is here to stay. Unlike many catch phrases and buzzwords that have come and gone in the markets over the past few years, AI is driving real-world progress and generating billions of dollars in sales for top companies. Can it go on? According to Statista, the AI market is expected to increase at a rate of 26.6% annually through 2031, reaching more than $1 trillion. Many of today's best tech companies are giving it their all, developing competitive AI businesses to grab a chunk of that market as it grows.Nvidia(NVDA0.30%),Meta Platforms(META0.96%), andAmazon(AMZN2.66%)are all leading the way, and they're three no-brainer AI stocks to buy today. Image source: Getty Images. Nvidia is a huge company that's still growing by leaps and bounds. It's a very rare situation for a company that already has $148 billion in trailing-12-month revenue to report growth of 69%, but that's what Nvidia did in its2026 fiscal first quarter(ended April 27). It's expecting to slow down, guiding for sales to increase 50% in the second quarter. That's still an unusual and amazing feat for a company of its size. Nvidia is the leader in its industry, which is semiconductors, or the chips that drive most of today's technology. According to some estimates, it has 95% of the AI chip market. As AI grows, Nvidia gets a huge share of that growth. It's constantly upgrading its technology with new products that can handle higher workloads, ensuring that it stays in the leading position. Although it has products in multiple categories, it's the AI chips that have catapulted it to the top of the tech heap, brought it to broad market attention, and briefly made it the most valuable company in the world. As it continues to lead and create improved products that all of its partners need, it could get there again soon. Considering its position and opportunities, it might surprise you that Nvidia stock isn't very expensive. It trades at aforward 1-year P/E ratioof 27, making it a no-brainer buy today. Meta is a social media giant, owning brands including Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. It uses AI in many important ways to drive business, from feeding users content they're looking for to keep them scrolling (and viewing ads) to providing a chatbot fueled by its own powerful large-language model. It operates a solid model driven by its digital advertising business, with daily actives continually rising along with revenue per user and total revenue. Total expenses keep declining as a percentage of revenue, leading to strong profitability. Revenue increased 16% year over year in the 2025 first quarter, whileoperating incomewas up 27%. Meta has a strong hold on literally the entire world's social media. The company had a staggering 3.43 billion people using one of its platforms in the first quarter, and it's monetizing these users through its ad business. Advertisers continue to move over to digital platforms, and as Meta's algorithms offer them high exposure and the AI creates pinpointed opportunities, the business will likely continue to grow. CEO Mark Zuckerberg envisions a time when an advertiser simply tells the company what its goals and budget are, and Meta takes care of the rest of the process. Meta is the cheapest stock on this list, trading at only 25 times forward 1-year earnings. It's a top stock with tons of potential at a great price. Amazon is building an AI platform that powers applications across businesses. Its Amazon Web Services (AWS)cloud segmentis the leading cloud provider in the world, and Amazon is investing more than $100 billion this year to upgrade and expand this platform and offer more features and tools. It has a three-layer system targeting every kind of client, with its signature Bedrock system at the middle layer, providing clients with a huge assortment of LLMs to create the AI apps. The bottom layer has the tools for developers to create their own LLMs, and the top layer is easy-to-use full solutions for the smaller enterprise. This is driving innovation and AI development across the spectrum. Amazon is now also creating the chips necessary to develop the apps for smaller customers looking for cheaper options than Nvidia's best-in-class chips. CEO Andy Jassy sees it getting much bigger. To engage with AI development, clients need to be on the cloud. For example, Amazon just announced that data and tech companyExperianis moving over to AWS specifically to engage with AI and create more compelling data analysis tools. As the leader in the industry, Amazon is poised to benefit from this shift over to the cloud, to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars. Amazon stock trades at 30 times forward 1-year earnings, and it's a great value that belongs in almost any portfolio.",

        "header": "FOMO Investing Explained: Protecting Your Money from Market Hype",
        "content": "Social media and the technological ease of trading today are energizing one of investors\u2019 biggest enemies: FOMO, or thefear of missing out. More than half (57%) of Americans say they have made a financial decision after seeing others' lifestyles online, according to a 2025 survey from Empower.And half of Americans said that seeing what others are buying on social media motivates them to spend money due to FOMO. Of course,following the crowd, especially impulsively, goes againststandard investing adviceand can result in poor\u00a0returns over time. But there are ways to combat the impulse to give in to FOMO. Below, we'll walk through why you should avoid it and the alternatives to take. When it comes to investing, FOMO leads to impulsively buying into the latest trend, often based on chatter on Reddit or TikTok. Seeing people rave about how much money they made from a certain stock can spark a fear of missing out on a great opportunity, and many people act on that fear. Why is acting on this temptation bad? First, even rational individual investors underperform the S&P 500 because ofpoor decisions regarding market timing.Those returns will only get worse if you start following the herd instead of making informed, independent decisions. FOMO leads to irrational decision-making as investors prioritize the chance of short-term gains over long-term planning. After all, once the internet is talking about how great an investment is, that investment has likely already been overbought and has grown more expensive. Plus, it could be about to be abandoned by earlier investors who've decided to take profits. Perhaps the most famous of \"meme stocks\" was GameStop (GME). Thanks to social media hype, in January 2021, its share price rose from around $5 to about $120 in under three weeks\u2014a gain of 2,300%.Many of those who arrived late to the party, though, endured significant pain. After topping out at $120.75, it was trading for just $10.97 a few weeks later\u2014a loss of 91%. First, understand that social media hype is a danger to your money. It fuelsherd behaviorand inappropriate risk taking. Be skeptical of any stock tip you see on social media and consider what might be in it for the people hyping that stock; they might be looking to profit off your FOMO. At the very least, do some significant research into any stock or other financial investment before you risk your money.Peter Lazaroff, the chief investment officer of Plancorp Wealth Management, believes research is key. \u201cAnytime you make an investment, you should put at least as much time into researching that investment as you would researching a vacation spot, restaurant, or major appliance,\u201d he said. \"And when you\u2019reresearching an investment, you need to consider multiple sources and channels. It\u2019s not enough to just look at different posters on Reddit or X, nor is it enough to look through TikTok and YouTube for information about a certain investment.\u201d Lazaroff also suggests waiting at least a month before acting on an investment idea. \u201cInvesting is along-term endeavor, so something that is a good idea today should still be a good idea in a month,\" he said. \"And if you don\u2019t feel that way about the investment in question, then you are more likely speculating on price than you are investing in a business.\u201d FOMO investing involves piling into investments being hyped on the internet simply because you\u2019re afraid of missing out on what others say is a great opportunity. Behaving this way generally doesn't end well and can be avoided by setting rules that prevent you from acting on impulses and doing your own research into any investment.",

        "header": "These 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Are Undervalued Right Now",
        "content": "Less than three months after the stock market plunged on President Donald Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs announcement, major indexes are back near all-time highs. Investors have shrugged off concerns around tariffs and a potential economic slowdown as businesses adjusted to the new trade regime and as economic data so far around unemployment and inflation has been stable, showing that tariffs have not yet had a significant impact on the economy. Despite the resurgence, which has led to stocks likeNvidiahitting all-time highs again, there are still deals to be found among artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. Keep reading to learn about two of them. Image source: Getty Images. Fresh off its latest earnings report,Micron Technology(MU-0.98%)just delivered another strong round of results in the fiscal third quarter, beating estimates on the top and bottom lines and offering better-than-expected guidance for the fourth quarter. There was one blemish in the report, which was that pricing declined slightly on a sequential basis, which led to the stock falling less than 1% on Thursday. However, Micron still looks well-positioned to capitalize on the AI boom. Its data center business is surging, more than doubling on a year-over-year basis, pacing overall revenue growth of 37%. It also reported nearly 50% revenue growth in high-bandwidth memory (HBM), and reached record DRAM revenue, which includes HBM. Micron's margins also improved. Its gross margin jumped from 26.9% to 37.7%, and operating margin increased from 10.6% to 23.3%. Adjusted earnings per share more than tripled from $0.62 to $1.91. In addition to its ramping financials, Micron finds itself in an advantageous position because it's the only U.S. manufacturer of advanced memory chips, meaning it's strategically important to the country at a time when the government is focused on reshoring chip production and ensuring adequate supply. Micron was awarded $6.2 billion from the CHIPS Act, and also agreed to invest $200 billion in new foundries in R&D in the U.S., though the timeline on that is unclear. Looking at valuation, Micron looks cheap. Based on its latest guidance, the stock trades at a forward P/E of less than 16, and analysts expect earnings per share to hit $12 in fiscal 2026, giving the stock a P/E of roughly 10 based on that forecast. Micron does face cyclical risk, but if the company can hit those numbers, the stock is a good bet to move higher. Another chip stock with significant upside potential isAdvanced Micro Devices(AMD-0.32%). AMD might not look undervalued, according to its trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 39, but that's actually an attractive price for the company's growth potential and momentum. AMD stock is still down by more than a third from its peak last year, but its recent results show it's growing quickly in the key data center segment, and it has emerged as the only real challenger to Nvidia in the AI GPU market. Though it's a distant second there, that's proven to be a valuable position, and is likely to earn it support from customers, as having competition for Nvidia is to their benefit as well. In its first-quarter earnings report, revenue rose 36% to $7.4 billion, led by a 57% jump in revenue to $3.7 billion, which was driven by growth in its EPYC CPU and Instinct GPU chips. AMD's strength in both CPUs and GPUs, arguably give it a competitive advantage as well and help differentiate the company from competitors. AMD also impressed in the client segment, where revenue jumped 68% to $2.3 billion thanks to strong demand for its Zen 5 Ryzen processor. While that growth rate is likely to slow, AMD has been steadily grabbing market share fromIntel, and that trend is likely to continue. The company is also making moves to beef up its AI capabilities. It acquired ZT Systems in the first quarter to improve its expertise in servers and rack-level solutions, which it said would help it address the data-center AI accelerator opportunity, which it said was expected to reach $500 billion by 2028. It's also acquired a number of AI start-ups, which should accelerate its advances in AI. Analysts are expecting rapid growth from the company, forecasting adjusted EPS of $5.71 in 2026. Based on that figure, the stock trades at a forward P/E of 25.2, making AMD looks like a good deal, considering its growth potential in AI and beyond.",

        "content": "Lululemon Athletica (LULU) filed a lawsuit against Costco Wholesale (COST), accusing the warehouse retail giant of infringing on its trademarks by selling clothing that is \"confusingly similar\" to designs trademarked by Lululemon. In the complaint filed Friday in a California federal court, Lululemon said Costco \"has unlawfully traded upon [Lululemon's] reputation, goodwill and sweat equity by selling unauthorized and unlicensed apparel employing knockoff, infringing versions of [Lululemon's] well-known trade dress and design patents.\" Costco did not immediately respond toInvestopedia'srequest for comment on the lawsuit. Consumers across the internet often spend substantial time and energy finding \"dupes\" of popular-but-expensive products like Lululemon's clothing. Lululemon cited in the complaint stories fromThe Washington Postand theNew York Times-owned review siteWirecutterlooking into Costco products that had drawn attention online for being near-identical replicas of Lululemon products. Lululemon lists six products Costco sells that allegedly violate its trademarked designs, including a Kirkland Signature pair of pants, and five jackets and hoodies from Danskin, Jockey, Spyder, and Hi-Tec. The apparel maker said Costco responded to a complaint Lululemon sent in November and stopped selling some of the violating items, but not all of them. Lululemon requested a jury trial to hear the case, and is seeking damages to make up for sales it may have lost by Costco offering similar products. Neither retailer's stock has been impacted by the suit, with Lululemon and Costco shares each up slightly in premarket trading Monday.",

        "header": "Are Target-Date Funds the Right Fit for Your Retirement Strategy?",
        "content": "Target-date funds have become very popular due to their simplicity and convenience, surpassing $4 trillion in assets in 2024 as more investors opt for a \"set-it-and-forget-it\" approach to retirement planning. But are they the right fit for your retirement goals? After all, a one-size-fits-all approach is rarely a good fit for everyone. Below, we'll explain whattarget-date fundsare, how they work, and what their pros and cons are.  A target-date fund is amutual fundorexchange-traded fund(ETF) that automatically adjusts its asset allocation based on a targeted retirement year. Following a predetermined \"glide path,\" the fund begins with a more aggressive allocation, typically heavily weighted toward equities, and gradually shifts to a more conservative mix of bonds and cash as the target retirement date approaches. For example, the allocation might shift from 60% stocks 30 years before retirement to 20% stocks after retirement. Beginning investors:Because target-date funds offer a \u201cset-it-and-forget-it\u201d approach, they are especially appealing to novice investors who are comfortable giving up control over day-to-day investment decisions. Young investors are also more likely to hold target-date funds, largely due to automatic enrollment in their401(k) plans. According to research by Vanguard, in 2023, 98% of retirement plans that had designated a Qualified Default Investment Alternative chose a target-date fund. Retirees:Research by Morningstar showed promising results for target-date funds. Even the lowest-performing funds in their survey delivered significantly less peak-to-trough drawdown during the first quarter\u2019s market volatility compared to the S&P 500, ensuring protection of a retiree\u2019s savings. Low-fee cost, passive investors:According to Morningstar, target-date funds reached a record $4 trillion in assets in 2024. This strong growth has been fueled by the low-cost structure of the funds and the increasing popularity ofpassive, index-based strategies. As assets surged, fund companies have opted to compete on price, with the averagenet expense ratiodropping to 0.29% in 2024 from 0.55% in 2015. One size fits all:Because they are primarily structured around a retirement date, target-date funds follow a one-size-fits-all approach that does not consider individual circumstances. To help offset this limitation, investors can use a target-date fund within a 401(k) while supplementing it with additional accounts, such as aRoth IRA, and maintaining anemergency savings fundas part of a morecomprehensive, personalized financial plan. Sequence-of-returns risk:Where investment losses early in retirement are compounded by portfolio withdrawals, this can significantly reduce the longevity of retirement savings. Many target-date funds will maintain anequities allocationof up to 60% at retirement age, which may be high for more conservative investors. On the other hand, because compounding often results in proportionally greater gains in later years, a glide path that's too conservative may limit growth potential and increase the risk of aretirement shortfall. Alternatives to target-date funds includerobo-advisors,DIY portfolios, and professionally managed accounts. For those who prefer a low-cost, passive approach while tailoring their investments to their unique circumstances, one option is to look at an all-in-one ETF, a diversified fund that automatically allocates across multiple asset classes based on atarget risk level, providing a simple, hands-off solution. Target-date funds offer a convenient, low-cost, and increasingly popular option for retirement planning, especially for beginners and passive investors. However, their one-size-fits-all structure and exposure to sequence-of-returns risk mean they may not suit every investor. A balanced approach, pairing a target-date fund with other accounts or exploring tailored alternatives, can help ensure a morepersonalized retirement strategy.",

        "header": "Is This Stock the Best Way to Play Chinese AI?",
        "content": "Would you believe that the best way to play China's AI ambitions may be a South African stock? Artificial intelligence has the potential to change the economy. As such, investors should have exposure to some AI companies in their portfolios -- and that includes Chinese exposure. EvenNvidiaCEO Jensen Huang recently noted that China is home to half of the world's AI researchers. And the January unveiling of the groundbreakingDeepSeekR1 model showed how China is able to innovate cutting-edge AI, even with limited silicon access. Nevertheless, investing in China carries risks pertaining to its economy, its government, and the market mechanics of owning Chinese stocks. That's why the best way to expose oneself to Chinese AI may be South African holding companyNaspers(NPSNY0.02%). It's still very early in the AI races, and in truth, it's hard to know who is going to win out. It could be an upstart AI lab such as DeepSeek in China orOpenAIin the U.S., or one of the existing big tech giants. In this investor's opinion, the existing incumbents are the best bet. These companies have huge technological and financial resources to invest in AI, and AI should also enable existing large businesses to boost revenue and lower costs through better automation and data science. That's whyTencent(TCEHY-0.29%)seems like good bet to be a big winner from Chinese AI. Tencent has the largest social media platform in China in WeChat, with more than 1.4 billion users. It's also the largest video game publisher in the China, the largest video and music streaming company, one of the two large digital payments companies, and one of China's cloud computing giants. In addition, Tencent is building its own large model, called Hunyuan, which could lead to vast new AI opportunities if it ends being more performant than DeepSeek and other competitors over time. Tencent stock doesn't trade on U.S. stock exchanges, but it does tradeover the counteras an American depositary receipt. However, a better way to play Tencent may be through its largest shareholder, European-domiciledProsus(PROSY-0.90%), which owns more than 23% of Tencent's stock. And the best way to invest in Prosus may be in its largest shareholder, Naspers, which owns 43% of Prosus. Naspers is a 110-year-old South African media company that was fortunate enough to invest in Tencent when it was just a startup in 2001. That investment eventually grew to be worth hundreds of billions, dwarfing Naspers' original business. Naspers then sold portions of its Tencent stake over time, investing in new businesses across food delivery, fintech, classifieds, e-commerce, ed-tech, and other tech startups. Image source: Naspers Q4 2025 presentation. However, Naspers began to trade at a huge discount to the value of not only itsnet assetsbut also its Tencent stake alone. Management attributed that growing discount to its large size relative to the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. The thinking was that large index funds cap their asset weightings, which meant they had to sell Naspers stock once it reached a certain-sized allocation. In 2019, Naspers created Prosus, a new entity it listed on the larger Euronext Exchange in Amsterdam, and spun it off to shareholders. Today, Naspers owns about 43% of Prosus, which owns all of Naspers' assets outside of South Africa, while Naspers owns some small additional South African assets on its own. The plan didn't really work, though, as, Prosus still trades at a 30% discount its total net assets and even a 9% discount to the value of its Tencent stakealone. Meanwhile, Naspers trades at an even bigger 36% discount to the value of its assets, which is mainly just its 43% stake in Prosus. Owning Tencent at a discount is an attractive proposition, but of course it won't make much of a difference if the valuation gap never closes. That being said, a new development at Prosus could change this dynamic. Before this year, Prosus' businesses were free cash flow negative, so the company was dependent on Tencent stock sales and Tencent's dividend for cash for funding. However, in fiscal 2025, which ended in March, Prosus' non-Tencent businesses turned free cash flow positive for the first time, excluding Tencent's dividend, generating $36 million in positive free cash flow and improving free cash flow by nearly $1 billion over the past three years. Prosus also has a new CEO in Fabricio Bloisi, who took over the job exactly one year ago. Bloisi is an entrepreneur and the very successful former CEO of iFood, now the largest food delivery company in Brazil, which Prosus fully acquired back in 2022. Having a proven startup operator is a contrast with Prosus' prior leadership, and recent results appear to show Bloisi is raising the bar on execution. Before today, if Prosus wanted to buy a company orrepurchaseits stock at a big discount, it would have to sell part of its Tencent stake. That probably played into the \"conglomerate discount,\" as investors may not have liked the capital allocation of selling a high-quality business in Tencent to buy more risky and unprofitable startups. However, if the other operating businesses continue to grow positive free cash flow outside Tencent, that could change sentiment. Prosus wouldn't have to sell as much or any Tencent stock and could benefit from futurecompound earningsgrowth. If a Prosus/Naspers valuation rerating occurs, that could make Prosus and/or Naspers the most attractive way to play Tencent -- and with it, the growth of Chinese AI.",

Morning Brief: Market Sunrise hostRamzan Karmalibreaks down what\u2019s behind the rally in China and whether investors should rethink their bet on the Magnificent Seven \u2014 the group of tech stocks comprised of Alphabet (GOOG,GOOGL), Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), Amazon, Meta Platforms (META), and Microsoft (MSFT). To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief: Market Sunrisehere. So, our call of the day is tech focus. Now, believe it or not, as a collective, and I mean a collective, the Magnificent Seven stocks, Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla, are pretty much flat year to date. In contrast, Chinese tech firms are up around 20% in 2025 so far. So, does this mean investors should shy away from these big US tech stocks? Well, it would be a pretty difficult to argue against those magnificent, Magnificent Seven, though. Take Nvidia, for example. It's up over 17% this year alone, and trading around the $157 mark. Now, numerous analysts believe that still makes the stock seriously undervalued with many targeting $250 a share. Also, in May, these mega stocks roared back into life, having their best month in two years. However, it certainly seems wise to take a closer look at Chinese tech stocks at the same time. The recent rise in the share price was spurred on by Deep Seek's artificial intelligence breakthrough. Chinese companies like Xiaomi, for example, are also making great strides in electric vehicles. But there is one major risk looming over all these stocks, and that's whether a meaningful trade deal between the US and China can be reached.",

The prestigious award - selected from more than 5,000 global nominations - recognizes Avenue Z's AIO Solution, and its ability to place brands at the top of AI Search. With this award, Avenue Z joins a powerhouse cohort of 2025 winners including NVIDIA, Microsoft, Meta, HPE, EY, Databricks, Honeywell, Arcade, Juniper Networks, and other global innovators. \"We launched AIO to solve one of the most important shifts in the history of digital communications: the move from keywords to questions, from links to answers,\" saidJeffrey Herzog, Founder and CEO of Avenue Z. \"Influence today is more powerful when it's invisible-architected with strategy, technology, and precision to ensure brands speak the language of generative AI and show up as trusted authorities in the conversations that drive modern decision-making. It's simple - consumers have shifted to AI search, and we're helping brands get there.\" AIO is the first solution purpose-built for generative search - not a bolt-on to legacy SEO. As platforms like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Perplexity shift from listing links to delivering synthesized answers, AI-powered search is surging. By 2027, over 90 million American adultsare expectedto use generative AI as their primary search tool, with Gen Z and Millennialsleading in AI trust. While AI is reportedly set to complement - not fully replace - traditional search, it's already driving a sharp decline in organic traffic, forcing publishers and marketers to rethink how visibility is earned. Avenue Z's AI Optimization (AIO) solution solves this challenge for brands with a three-pronged approach: High-authority media placement to establish brand trust in sources large language models (LLMs) cite; Conversational content creation aligned with AI-first query formats and voice; Technical LLM optimization using semantic schema, metadata, and structure designed for machine interpretation. What makes this AI Optimization Solution unique is its cognitive model - a communications framework that ensures clients are not just searchable, but selected, when AI platforms synthesize responses for consumers. \"This is not SEO retrofitted for AI,\" addedJohnny Hughes, Chief Marketing Officer and AI Council Chair at Avenue Z. \"This is a new language for influence, blending technical precision with strategic storytelling so our clients own the questions that matter most.\" Led by Herzog, who previously revolutionized SEO through iCrossing, Avenue Z is building the new blueprint for how brands succeed in the AI era. \"We're proud to be doing for AI what we once did for Google search: building the map before the rest of the industry knows they need it,\" said Herzog. \"With AIO, we're not gaming algorithms, we're guiding conversations and content at the intersection of influence and machine logic.\" The AI Breakthrough Awards, produced byTech Breakthrough, recognize the world's most innovative companies, products, and technologies in artificial intelligence. This year's program included standout entries from startups and tech titans alike, across categories such as machine learning, NLP, computer vision, and cognitive computing. \"This award is more than recognition - it's validation that our commitment to strategic communication in the AI era is working,\" saidWhitney Hart, Chief Strategy Officer at Avenue Z. \"AIO empowers brands to shape narrative and trust in a world where machines mediate influence.

These efforts reflect the broader $84 billion capital raise initiative under the firm\u2019s \u201c42/42\u201d plan, which is intended to fund continued bitcoin accumulation through 2027. Recently, Strategy Executive Chairman Michael Saylor made the case during the BTC Prague conference that the bitcoin price could rise to $21 million over the next 21 years, which explains the company's reasoning behind acquiring as much bitcoin as they can as quickly as possible. As of now, the company\u2019s average bitcoin purchase price sits at $70,982 per coin, resulting in over $21 billion in unrealized gains. According to BitcoinTreasuries.net, Strategy is by far the world's largest publicly traded bitcoin treasury company, with the closest competitor\u2014bitcoin miner MARA Holdings\u2014having a bitcoin stash of roughly a tenth the size of Strategy's. Bitcoin treasury companies have exploded in popularity over the past couple of years, as the cryptocurrency continues to gain adoption as a strategic reserve asset for corporations. There are now at least 140 publicly traded companies with bitcoin on their balance sheets around the world. Strategy shares are up 2% in Monday morning trading and are up more than 35% for the year.",

The Tesla (TSLA) CEO over the weekend expressed criticism of the taxation-and-spending bill that'sworking its way through Congresson X, the same social-media platform on which his comments on the legislation, among other things, sparked a firestorm earlier this month. Things were different this time. Musk focused on specific aspects of the legislation, attacking segments he says damage the U.S. position in alternative energy.

        "header": "Annuities Could Transform Your Retirement Income\u2014Here's How",
        "content": "Annuities are savings and income products offered by insurance companies. They are often included in retirement planning as potential sources of income. Technically, they\u2019re not investments, however. They act more like irons in the fire, waiting and ready to provide you with income at a time and in a manner that you choose. Read on to learn about their impact on your retirement income and whether they might play a part in your planning. An annuity is a contract between an insurance company and an individual that ultimately turns an asset (your money) into a year-long income stream. To purchase an annuity, you can pay one significant premium, or you can make a series of payments over a designated period known as the accumulation phase. You can elect to take the money in a single lump sum payment, or you can spread out payouts according to predetermined terms. You can begin taking withdrawals right away, or you can wait until retirement. An annuity certain makes payments to you over a set number of years, or term. Payments will pass to your named beneficiary if you should die before the term expires.A life annuity will pay out until you die or for an agreed-upon number of years, whichever is longer. Some insurance companies will let you purchase riders as well, allowing you to add on additional benefits. All terms are set forth in the contract between you and the insurer at the time of purchase. Most annuities fall into one of three categories: fixed, variable, or indexed. A fixed annuity pays interest on the amount you paid in, at an agreed-upon rate. All costs and charges incurred by the annuity are deducted first. Then interest is paid on the remaining balance. This type of annuity can be either deferred or immediate. With a deferred annuity, the insurer guarantees that the interest rate will never drop below a certain point. An immediate fixed annuity guarantees you an ongoing, predetermined payment (usually monthly) that lasts for a specific period of years or for your lifetime. This type of annuity crosses the line into investing. The insurance company will invest your purchase money into bonds, stocks, or other securities, according to your preference. Fees are deducted from your money before it's invested. Your annuity account balance can suffer if the investments you choose fall in value. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulates and monitors variable annuities along with state-level insurance commissioners in some cases. Other types of annuities are regulated only at the state level. \u201cVariable annuities are more complex because they have the potential to achieve higher returns by investing in a range of underlying investments, including equities and fixed-income,\u201d saysDavid Rosenstrock, CFP\u00ae, MBA, and Director of Financial Planning and Investments at\u00a0Wharton Wealth Planning. \u201cYour payout won\u2019t be as big if your investments do poorly, just like any other investment.\u201d With indexed annuities, the insurance company guarantees a minimum return. It\u2019s based on the return of an index, often the S&P 500. Your purchase money grows not only due to earned interest but also on changes in the index's value, always assuming that\u2019s a positive change. A negative change in the index's value reduces the value of your account. Some insurers allow value drops only up to a certain point. Again, you are guaranteed a minimum value. Indexed annuities also fall into two categories: equity-indexed (EIAs) or registered index-linked (RILAs). EIAs guarantee a minimum rate of interest plus interest earned on the performance of the associated market index. RILAs are subject to buffers or floors, the terms of which you can elect. A buffer is how much of a loss the insurer will take on before it passes losses on to you. A floor allows you to cite the percentage you\u2019ll take as a loss before additional losses pass to the insurer. 1.One significant benefit of saving with an annuity is that its value grows tax-deferred until you take that lump sum payment or begin taking regular payments. Because your growing balance remains undiminished by taxes, more of it can keep on working for you. This applies to dividends, interest, and any capital gains. 2.Another benefit: a reliable and predictable stream of income throughout your retirement years until the time of your death (if you spread out the payments rather than take a lump sum). \u201cCertain types of annuities can guarantee income for life. This guaranteed income can be a great hedge against the risk of outliving your savings,\u201d saysMatt Hylland, a financial planner at Arnold and Mote Wealth Management in Cedar Rapids, IA. 3.You can also contribute as much money as you like to an annuity, unlike 401(k)s or individual retirement accounts (IRAs), which have contribution limits controlled by federal law. 4.Certain types of annuities\u2014for instance, an immediate income annuity\u2014guarantee a fixed income payout no matter what\u2019s going on with stocks or interest rates. Your savings won't be affected should markets drop in value. The insurance company will pay your beneficiary the amount you\u2019ve paid in, at a minimum, at the time of your passing. Annuities come with some important drawbacks as well. 1.The taxation benefit won't last forever. Your annuity\u2019s growth is tax-deferred, not tax-free. You\u2019ll have to pay taxes on any gains when you take money out in either a lump sum or via regular scheduled payments. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) may hit you with an additional 10% penalty if you do so before age 59\u00bd. 2.The payments you receive in retirement aren't adjusted to keep pace with inflation.So the purchasing power of the money you originally gave the insurance company could be radically different from what it is for the money you receive later in retirement. \u201cMost annuities don\u2019t provide payments that increase with inflation,\u201d Hylland says. \u201cThis is most important for those who purchase an annuity early in retirement, when they may still be facing a few decades of inflation. You shouldn\u2019t only consider the cash flow you need today when deciding how much of an annuity to purchase, but also how much you\u2019ll need a decade or more from now.\u201d You can sometimes add a cost-of-living rider to an annuity, but, of course, there will be a charge for that. 3.Annuities come with numerous fees, costs, and charges. Some of them are ongoing, such as annual maintenance fees, and others are triggered by certain events. \u201cSignificant fees, surrender charges, and potential hidden costs can eat into your returns,\" says Rosenstrock. \u201cThese fees are often not transparently disclosed upfront, leading many investors to realize the actual cost after they\u2019ve made the purchase and see it live.\u201d 4.In addition, there\u2019s always the possibility that the insurance company will fail.Should this occur, you\u2019d have no protection from financial loss because annuities aren\u2019t guaranteed by any federal agency such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). You could pay a penalty ranging from 5% to 10% of the amount of your withdrawal if you cash out earlier than you agreed to in your contract. You\u2019ll typically pay a management fee, too, if your money is invested. Your choice can ultimately come down to weighing the common pros and cons of annuities against the issues that matter to you most. Is a steady income in retirement more important to you than getting financially dinged if you change your mind or otherwise realize that you have to liquidate early? Do you prefer a steady and reliable stream of income or investing your capital in the stock market or other securities in the hope of significant returns? \u201cAn annuity might make sense for very conservative and risk-averse individuals who are nearing retirement and seek a guaranteed income stream to cover expenses during their later years,\u201d Rosenstrock points out. An annuity can provide those in retirement with a welcome, steady income stream that they can depend on for years. It can enhance other income streams such as Social Security benefits and annual payments from retirement accounts. But they can be complicated, and they're not for everyone. If you're interested, be sure that you understand exactly how they work. Ask about any fees, expenses, costs, and other charges cited in the contract so you\u2019re prepared for them going in. Ask whether there are any costs that aren't clearly spelled out, too. Check in with a financial professional and perhaps even a tax consultant before you sign on the bottom line, just as you should for any other savings and investment product.",

        "content": "For professional traders, paying close attention to the market\u2019s everyday price swings is generally a full-time commitment. For casual traders with day jobs that make it difficult to follow the markets, there are a number of trading strategies available that allow you to generate income while having a day job elsewhere, and they entail selling options. Unlike buying options, where traders usually try to speculate on an imminent price move, strategies for selling options are aimed at generating periodic income and often benefit from the passage of time. Thebest options brokersmake selling just as easy as buying. In this article, we'll introduce you to four popular strategies for earning extra income selling options. There are a number of strategies that traders can use to produce periodic income from options. Next, we\u2019ll introduce you to four popular strategies that do not require a lot of time and effort maintaining each trading position. Aputoption is a contract that gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to sell a specific amount of an underlying security at a predetermined price within a specified time period. A put option increases in value as the underlying stock or security's price decreases. Conversely, put options decline in value as the price of the underlying stock increases. A cash-secured put is an strategy where an investor sells a put option while setting aside enough cash to buy the underlying stock if assigned. It\u2019s typically used when the investor is willing to buy the stock at a lower price. If the option expires worthless, the seller keeps thepremiumas income. Ifassigned, they buy the stock at the strike price, potentially at a discount. Benefits include generating income, entering positions at preferred prices, and managing risk through a defined cash reserve. It\u2019s ideal for long-term investors seeking both downside protection and opportunity. Acalloption is a contract that gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to purchase an underlying asset at a predetermined price before a set expiration date. The value of a call option increases as the underlying stock or security's price decreases. Conversely, call options decline in value as the price of the underlying stock increases. While most people think of call options as a kind of lottery ticket used to score a jackpot from an explosive price rally, sellingcovered callsis a strategy designed to cash in when a stock\u2019s upside trajectory is expected to slow or transition sideways. A trader that owns 100 shares or more of a stock can generate additional income by periodically selling call options to willing buyers and keeping the premium each time. Thisstrategycombines buying a protective put and selling a covered call simultaneously.\u00a0 The put option insures against big price drops, and the call option provides income. This is a low-risk, low-reward strategy. When a trader sells a shorter-term option and buys a longer-term option at the same strike price, it is known as acalendar spread. To execute this trade, income traders typically select a strike that is out of the money (calls for a bullish trade, puts for a bearish trade). Similar to a covered call, a trader can repeatedly collect premium each month (or every week if the stock has weekly options available) so long as they are holding a longer-term option. Like buying options, selling options requires approval from your broker who wants to ensure your understanding of all associated risks. Fortunately,best options brokersmake the application process very quick and straightforward. Selling options has the potential to generate extra income trading, even for those with a full-time job in an unrelated field. Strategies like cash-secured puts, covered calls, collars, and calendar spreads offer defined risk, potential income, and flexibility\u2014especially when paired with quality stocks. That said, traders should fully understand trade mechanics and underlying risks, before entering such positions.",

Shares of the Raleigh, N.C.-based Ralliant, formerly the Precision Technologies segment of Fortive, recently were down 9% in their NYSE debut. Shares of industrial technology conglomerate Fortive fell almost 5%, making it the worst-performing stock in theS&P 500. Over the weekend, \"Fortive shareholders received one share of common stock of Ralliant for every three shares of common stock of Fortive held at the close of business on June 16, 2025,\" the Everett, Wash.-based firm announced. Concurrently, Olumide Soroye assumed the CEO role at Fortive as part of a planned transition in conjunction with the company's split, which was announced last September.Soroye succeeded James Lico, who retired but will continue to serve as an advisor until the end of the year. \"Since our last earnings call, we have experienced increased pressure on tariff-related pricing and customer demand driven largely by heightened uncertainty in trade, healthcare, and government spending policy,\" said Soroye. \"This created headwinds for revenue and core revenue growth that built late in the second quarter. As a result, we now estimate our second quarter revenue and core revenue as flat to slightly down across new Fortive, with the Precision Technologies segment, now Ralliant, declining mid-single digits as expected.\"",

        "header": "Prediction: These Will Be the Two Best-Performing \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks Over the Next 5 Years",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" is a group of technology stocks that includesNvidia,Microsoft,Apple,Amazon(AMZN-1.59%),Alphabet(GOOGL-1.19%)(GOOG-0.43%),Meta Platforms, andTesla. Grouped together because they play an outsized role in the tech sector and in shaping the broader market, this basket of stocks has absolutely crushed broader-market indexes over the last five years. In fact, only Amazon has underperformed theS&P 500over the stretch. Given their individual competitive advantages and industry-shaping capabilities, there's a good chance that this group of stocks will continue to outperform the market -- but it's also virtually certain that some of these stocks will significantly outperform their peers. With that in mind, two Motley Fool contributors think that the two companies below will be the best-performing Magnificent Seven stocks over the next five years. Image source: Getty Images. Jennifer Saibil(Amazon):Amazon has a few advantages over some of the other \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks, which makes it more likely that it will outdo them over the next few years and end up even more valuable. Let's go through them. At today's prices, Amazon stock isn't expensive relative to its historical norms. It trades at aprice-to-earnings (P/E) ratioof around 35, near its lowest value in a decade, which gives it more room to expand. It's easy to see how Amazon stock could rise in value over the next few years and make it the most -- or nearly the most -- valuable company in the world. Keith Noonan(Alphabet):Alphabet has continued to serve up impressive business results, but its share price has actually fallen roughly 6% this year. Concerns that antitrust suits and investigations could result in the business being broken up have helped to dampen enthusiasm for the stock -- but I think that it stands out as one of the most promising investment opportunities in the Magnificent Seven. While a potential breakup of the business could wind up creating some near-term valuation volatility, the individual units under the company's corporate umbrella continue to look very strong. It's also possible that businesses that would be spun off would wind up actually receiving higher valuations as stand-alones -- leaving the door open for Alphabet shareholders to see beneficial outcomes even if regulators disrupt the company's current structure. Like other members of the Magnificent Seven, Alphabet is making big investments in artificial intelligence, but its potential to score big wins appears to be underappreciated compared to other members of the cohort. In addition to AI growth opportunities in digital ads and software, Alphabet's increased focus on designing and utilizing its own AI chips could help power growth for its cloud infrastructure business. OpenAI recently announced that it was renting processing use of the company's tensor processing units (TPUs) through Google Cloud for AI inference applications, marking one of its first big pivots away from Nvidia's processors for this aspect of artificial intelligence. Given OpenAI's leading position in the generative AI space, it's not unreasonable to expect that some other big players in the category might follow suit. Alphabet's long-term opportunity in the autonomous vehicle space also appears very far from being priced into its valuation. Through its Waymo subsidiary, the company currently occupies a leading position in the robotaxi and driverless-vehicle market. Waymo remains far ahead of Tesla in terms of vehicle-fleet size, trips, and road miles, and it's building a strong track record in vehicle safety. In addition to sales opportunities in the consumer robotaxi space, Waymo could allow Alphabet to tap into the massive market for self-driving vehicle delivery software. With the company's core businesses looking undervalued and some potentially explosive growth opportunities taking shape, Alphabet could very well be the best-performing Magnificent Seven stock over the next five years.",

        "content": "US stocks climbed to fresh records on Monday amid signs of progress in trade talks, ending one of the most volatile first halves of a year in recent memory. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose over 0.6%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) moved up about 0.5%, with both indices notching new record highs as the benchmark index closed above 6,200 for the first time. Big Tech giants Nvidia (NVDA) and Meta (META) hit their own fresh records. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite last week had clinchednew record highsfor the first time since February \u2014 the start of the year's tariff-fueled stock swings. Stocks started aholiday-shortened weekon an upbeat note as hopes rose that the US and its top trading partners are closing in on deals over the sweeping tariffs introduced by President Trump. Canada scrapped a digital services taxtargeting US tech companies late on Sunday \u2014 just hours before it was set to start collecting payments \u2014 in a bid to revive stalled trade negotiations. The easing in odds of a global trade war comes as aJuly 9 deadline loomsfor the resumption of sweeping US \"reciprocal\" tariffs, which Trump on Sunday said he didn't think he'd need to extend. So far, his administration has hammered out only two accords \u2014 not full-blown agreements \u2014 with China and the UK, with the Britishtariff deal going into effecton Monday. Trump tariffs: Read the latest here Market watchers were closely following Senate negotiations overTrump\u2019s proposed $4.5 trillion tax cut bill, as Republican leaders race to persuade party holdouts to back the legislation. The Congressional Budget Office estimated it would add $3.3 trillion to the deficit over a decade, as it stands. TheSenate wasvoting on dozens of amendments in a marathon session on Monday. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) fell about 5 basis points to 4.23%. Looking ahead, theJune jobs report on Thursday will be a highlight, as markets increasingly grow optimistic that the Federal Reserve could lower interest rates soon. But the week's trading will be cut short, asmarkets will close at 1 p.m. ET on Thursday, and remain shut on Friday for the Fourth of July holiday. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) and S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose around 0.5% Monday to notch fresh records, ending a volatile first half of the year. Those gains come after the two indexes hit new highs last week for the first time since February. The tech-heavy Nasdaq moved up as Nvidia (NVDA) and Meta (META) notched their own record closing highs. Microsoft (MSFT) touched an intraday high but ended the day nose hairs short of a new record. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) climbed 0.6% but was still clawing its way back toward its prior record close in December. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) fell 5 basis points as investors closely watched the advancement of Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" through the Senate. Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer reports: Readmore here. Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) touched all-time highs on Monday as Big Tech companies led modest gains. Meta was poised to close at a new record after CEO Mark Zuckerbergannounced a restructuring of the company\u2019s artificial intelligence group. Microsoft and Meta have risen by double-digit percentages year to date, while AI giant Nvidia (NVDA) hit fresh records last week. President Trump broke new ground in his ongoing calls for Fed Chair Jerome Powell to cut interest rates \u2014 the president sent a signed note to the Fed chair. In apost on Truth Social, the social network owned by Trump, the president again called for Powell and the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, writing that Powell and the Fed's Board of Governors \"should be ashamed of themselves for allowing this to happen to the United States.\" Trump added that the Fed should cut rates to 1%. Earlier this month, theFed kept its benchmark interest rate in a range of 4.25%-4.5%. Trump's post included a signed picture of global central bank interest rates that showed the nearly three dozen global central banks that have set benchmark rates below the Fed. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed in a press conference Monday that this signed table was sent to Powell. Trump's latest barbs at Powell come as speculation over who will replace Powell as Fed chair next year continues to heat up. During an interview onBloomberg earlier on Monday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested there are people already at the Fed being considered to take Powell's role as chair. Bessent added that there are other strategies Trump could pursue, such as filling the open seat on the Fed's Board of Governors, that could exert pressure on Powell before his term as chair is up next May. AsYahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger has reported, former Fed government Kevin Warsh, current Fed governor Christoper Waller, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, former World Bank president David Malpass, and Bessent are candidates that have been discussed to replace Powell, according to people close to the administration. Shares of Robinhood (HOOD) spiked more than 11% on Monday, setting the stock up to close at a record high, after the trading platform said it has launched tokenized trading for more than 200 US stocks and ETFs in the European Union. The announcement continues Robinhood's push into crypto, using blockchain technology to allow European investors to trade the commission-free tokens around the clock, five days a week.

Slowinski also wrote: \u201cIn addition, business model transition risks may weigh on top line Search Advertising growth as Google sees fewer Search clicks, and explores new monetisation approaches like AI Overviews, AI Mode, Live Search and the Gemini Assistant.\u201d Meta (META) stock was on pace to close at a record high on Monday for the first time since February. Shares hit an all-time intraday high just north of $748 each. Meta has outperformed the rest of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks year to date, gaining 26% compared to a 17% increase in AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA), which is also hovering at record highs. Meta has been doubling down on AI, recently investing in the startup Scale AI (SCAI.PVT). As part of the deal, Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wangwill reportedly join Meta\u2019s AI research labfocused on pursuing \"superintelligence.\" The first half of 2025 marked a triumphant return of crypto optimism. From President Trump's crypto-friendly stance and his appointment ofa new SEC chairto the first couple's owncontroversial coins, momentum in the industry returned, helping boost bitcoin to record highs near $112,000. Yahoo Finance'sInes Ferr\u00e9reports: Read more here. Morgan Stanley (MS) analysts wrote in a note to clients Sunday that they are bullish on Nvidia (NVDA) stock and \"looking through\" concerns over bottlenecks in its supply chain that could lead the chipmaker to produce GPUs faster than its suppliers can build them into server racks. After meeting with industry contacts in Taiwan and Beijing, analyst Joseph Moore wrote that Nvidia's supply chain is \"strong near term\" but \"mixed longer term.\" \"Near-term data points from several supply chain participants suggest strength in AI, but significant skepticism about 2026 remains,\" Moore wrote. \"That skepticism is driven by the same concerns we hear about from US investors \u2014 chip production ahead of various supply bottlenecks will lead to excess inventory by year end.\" \"The reason we are looking through these concerns is that our contacts point to very strong demand for all Blackwell form factors, and supply bottlenecks across racks and power management easing materially,\" the analyst added. Moore said Nvidia is his top pick of chip stocks. The Financial Timesreportedin late May that Nvidia's suppliers had resolved technical issues that had delayed shipments of its Blackwell AI servers and threatened the chipmaker's annual sales targets. Nvidia stock last week notched a new record high. Shares fell fractionally Monday morning. Hewlett Packard Enterprise stock (HPE) jumped more than 13% Monday morning following news over the weekend that the company had settled a case with the US Department of Justice. The DOJsuedHPE \u2014 one of the largest makers of wireless networking systems \u2014 in January to block the company's proposed $14 billion acquisition of another company in the industry, Juniper Networks (JNPR). Juniper Networks shares were up 8% early Monday. The settlement \"paves the way to close HPE\u2019s acquisition of Juniper Networks,\" HPE CEO Antonio Neri said in astatementSaturday. Juniper has a \"strong position\" in the artificial intelligence space, Bank of America's Wamsi Mohan wrote in a note to clients Monday. With the acquisition of Juniper, HPE is \"positioned to offer an end-to-end networking and AI infrastructure stack that can better compete in AI-enabled datacenter and cloud-edge environment,\" boosting the company's earnings over the long term. Stocks moved higher at the market open Monday to start aholiday-shortened week, set to notch fresh records amid rising hopes for US trade deals ahead of the July 9 deadline. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose roughly 0.5%. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) moved up about 0.3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) jumped about 0.4%. Oracle stock soared more than 7% and was set to start the trading session at a new intraday high after the software giant disclosed in a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission that it had signed new cloud services agreements. \u201cOracle is off to a strong start in FY26,\" CEO Safra Catz will tell other Oracle colleagues later today, accordingto the filing. \"Our MultiCloud database revenue continues to grow at over 100%, and we signed multiple large cloud services agreements including one that is expected to contribute more than $30 billion in annual revenue starting in FY28.\" In its fiscal year 2025, which ended May 31, Oracle's revenue was $57.4 billion. The company partnered with OpenAI (OPAI.PVT) and SoftBank (SFTBY) to launch the highly publicized $500 billion Stargate project, building AI data centers earlier this year, but the project hasstalled. Solar stocks fluctuated in premarket trading Monday after it emerged that the Senate's draft version of the tax and spending bill, which slasheswind and solar tax credits, also now contains a tax on wind and solar projects completed after 2027 that use components from China. The tax on renewable projectscame as a surpriseto the industry, which largely relies on China to source components from batteries to solar panels.A statement from the American Clean Power Associationsaid the effect would be to \"strand hundreds of billions of dollars in current investments.\" The latest provision comes after solar stocks were hit two weeks ago when lawmakers moved to phase out tax breaks for the industry sooner than expected. Shares of NextEra Energy (NEE) dropped 4% while Enphase Energy (ENPH) stock fell 2.6%. The Invesco Solar ETF (TAN) declined 1.5%. However, there were some bright spots for certain renewable stocks. US-based First Solar (FSLR) rose 7%, while GE Vernova (GEV), which offers wind technologies, added 1.1%. And Sunrun (RUN) gained 7% while SolarEdge Technologies (SEDG) advanced 0.5% due to a short-term extension of residential solar tax credits. Read more here.

On Friday, American business publication The Information reported that production of the company\u2019s next-generation AI chip is being delayed to 2026. A development team working together to create the next version of Windows. The media group, citing three sources familiar with the matter, said that the Maia AI chip was facing a delay of at least six months, which will push its mass production from 2025 to next year. The report also added that the chip is likely to fall well short of Nvidia\u2019s Blackwell chip in performance. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) had hoped to use the chip, code-named Braga, in its data centers this year. However, the plan has been stalled due to unanticipated design changes, staffing constraints, and high turnover, according to the report. Like other big tech companies, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has been investing heavily to develop custom processors for AI operations and other applications to reduce reliance on costly Nvidia chips.

In the past five years, Nvidia's stock price has been up over 1,543%. The company's market cap has risen above $3.8 trillion.

Huang's sales were part of a previously disclosed plan that was revealed in March and would allow him to sell up to 6 million shares of Nvidia's stock before the end of 2025.

Nvidia has also dealt with headwinds related to export controls on its most advanced AI chips, which restrict sales to countries like China. The company's AI focus and the increased demand for AI advancements have helped Nvidia sustain its momentum despite those setbacks.

        "content": "-OpenAI said it has no active plans to use Google's in-house chip to power its products, two days after Reuters and other news outlets reported on the AI lab's move to turn to its competitor's artificial intelligence chips to meet growing demand. A spokesperson for OpenAI said on Sunday that while the AI lab is in early testing with some of Google's tensor processing units (TPUs), it has no plans to deploy them at scale right now. Google declined to comment. While it is common for AI labs to test out different chips, using new hardware at scale could take much longer and would require different architecture and software support. OpenAI is actively using Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs), and AMD's AI chips to power its growing demand. OpenAI is also developing its chip, an effort that is on track to meet the \"tape-out\" milestone this year, where the chip's design is finalized and sent for manufacturing. OpenAI has signed up for Google Cloud service to meet its growing needs for computing capacity, Reuters had exclusively reported earlier this month, marking a surprising collaboration between two prominent competitors in the AI sector. Most of the computing power used by OpenAI would be from GPU servers powered by the so-called neocloud company CoreWeave. Google has been expanding the external availability of its in-house AI chips, or TPUs, which were historically reserved for internal use. That helped Google win customers, including Big Tech player Apple, as well as startups like Anthropic and Safe Superintelligence, two ChatGPT-maker competitors launched by former OpenAI leaders.
