        "content": "CrowdStrike (CRWD) shares retreated from theirrecord highon Wednesday after the cybersecurity provider issued a disappointing quarterly revenue outlook. The company reported better-than-expected earnings for its latest quarter and announced ashare repurchase programof up to $1 billion. However, CrowdStrike's guidance of\u00a0fiscal second-quarter revenue of $1.14 billion to $1.15 billion came in below Wall Street Expectations. CrowdStrike shares fell nearly 6% to around $461 on Wednesday, leading Nasdaq decliners. Even with the sharp decline, the stock has gained 50% over the past 12 months, as the cybersecurity giant has recovered from anerroneous software updatelast July that caused a widespread outage of Windows PCs. Below, we take a closer look at CrowdStrike\u2019s chart and usetechnical analysisto identify major price levels worth watching out for. After forming two closely aligned troughs just below the200-day moving average, CrowdStrike shares have trended sharply higher, albeit on lacklustertrading volume. The stock broke out from anascending triangleto anall-time highthis week in a move that coincided with therelative strength indexnudging toward overbought territory. However, longer-term bullish momentum was tested on Wednesday following the cybersecurity provider\u2019s soft outlook. Let\u2019s identify three majorsupport levelson CrowdStrike\u2019s chart where the shares may encounter support and also locate a key overhead area to monitor if the stock resumes its longer-termuptrend. The first lower level to watch sits around $455. This area on the chart would likely provide significant support near the ascending triangle\u2019s top trendline and the prominent Februaryswing high. A close below this level could see the shares retrace to the $390 level. The shares may attract support in this location near a trendline that links severalpeaksthat formed on the chart between December and April. Further selling opens the door for a drop to lower support around $340. Investors could see this region, which sits just above the notable March and April troughs, as a longer-term floor given its proximity to a series of lows that developed on the chart from late November to early January. If CrowdStrike shares resume their longer-term uptrend, investors can project an overhead area to monitor by using the measured move technique, also known as themeasuring principle. When applied to CrowdStrike\u2019s chart, we calculate the distance between the ascending triangle\u2019s two trendlines near this widest point and add that amount the pattern\u2019sbreakoutarea.

        "content": "Nvidia's(NVDA0.68%)recent earnings report boosted the market and alleviated concerns about any slowdown in artificial intelligence (AI) and data-center-related spending. That's great news for Nvidia and other frontline players in the AI/data center industry. It's also great news for some of the more esoteric, yet no less investable, stocks with exposure to the theme, such asGE HealthCare Technologies(GEHC0.01%), industrial software companyPTC(PTC0.36%), and data center equipment companyVertiv(VRT0.71%). Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang noted his company's collaboration with GE HealthCare on AI-powered robotics during Nvidia's recent fiscal first-quarter 2026 earnings call. The healthcare company is utilizing Nvidia's AI-powered robotics platform, Isaac, to enhance the value of its imaging systems, and Huang referenced it as an example of the \"era of robotics.\" He has a point, and the value-add from embedding AI-powered applications into GE HealthCare's leading imaging systems (including ultrasound, MRI scanners, and X-ray equipment) is that they can guide patients better and optimally gather and analyze data from images in an automated manner. Moreover,AItools help support decision-making and patient monitoring. These are all major pluses for a company that manufactures imaging equipment, as well as the pharmaceutical diagnostics used in conjunction with it to diagnose and guide the application of targeted treatments. Additionally, GE HealthCare provides solutions that enable the monitoring of patients. As such, AI adds value across all of GE HealthCare's businesses, and that's likely to translate into better patient outcomes and boost long-term sales growth for the company. Image source: Getty Images. Huang also highlighted an AI area that often receives insufficient recognition, namely industrial AI. The underlying trend behind investment in AI and digital technology is already strong, and it is only going to intensify if President Donald Trump achieves his goal of onshoring manufacturing back to the U.S. and away from low-labor-cost countries. Automation, robotics, and AI-powered industrial software are the answer to the question of how to reshore production cost-effectively. Huang noted: Every factory will have an AI factory associated with it. And in order to create these physical AI systems, you really have to train a vast amount of data. So back to more data, more training, more AIs to be created, more computers. That's where Nvidia's partner PTC comes in. Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) help designers to utilize PTC's computer-aided design (CAD) software, and create real-time digital models that interact with the physical world to improve the performance of machinery in the latter, not least through the use of advanced real-time AI-powered analytics in its product lifecycle management (PLM) software. PTC has grown recurring revenue at a double-digit rate in recent years, andit's set to drive mid-teens growthin free cash flow (FCF). If Huang's belief in the power of industrial AI is justified, then that rate of growth could persist for a long time into the future. Image source: Getty Images. Let's move on from two companies that are adding value by using AI, to one that's adding value by contributing to the growth of AI, specifically the power needed to support growth in AI at data centers. Vertiv continues to generatestrong orders and backlog growth in 2025, but the key question with growth stocks is always what happens beyond the near to medium term, and will t justify the stock's valuation? One answer comes from a recentNvidia blog postoutlining the company's leadership in transitioning to 800 volt high voltage direct current (800V HVDC) data centers \"starting in 2027.\" The conversion of high-voltage power from the grid to 800V HVDC in the data center (rather than using lower-voltage power) improves conversion efficiency, reduces copper requirements, and improves reliability, according to Nvidia. That's where Vertiv comes in, because it recently confirmed  that its 800 volt direct current (VDC) power architecture for data centers is scheduled for launch in the second half of 2026, ahead of Nvidia's next generation of platforms intended for 800V HVDC, or 800 VDC. Vertiv's solutions include rectifiers to convert grid power to 800 VDC, busways to distribute the power, converters to lower the voltage to a manageable level, and backup systems to support the data center. Vertiv faces competition, not least from powerful companies likeEatonandSchneider. Still, the growth opportunity remains significant for all market players, and Vertiv is a specialist in power solutions for communications and data centers.",

These initiatives, which include supporting AI startups and introducing programming languages for autonomous vehicles, underscore the company's commitment to innovation. Over the past quarter, NVIDIA's stock price increased by 28%, which significantly outpaced the broader market's 13% rise over the past year. The company's revenue growth aligned with strong earnings reports further supports this momentum, reflecting positive investor sentiment amid generally flat market conditions in the last week. These key developments likely added weight to NVIDIA's stock performance. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 1 possible red flag for NVIDIA you should know about. The end of cancer? These 23 emerging AI stocks are developing tech that will allow early identification of life changing diseases like cancer and Alzheimer's. NVIDIA's recent collaborations with Accenture and AdaCore could significantly enhance its presence in artificial intelligence and automotive sectors. These initiatives may position the company to further capitalize on AI and autonomous vehicle markets, potentially leading to increased revenue streams and improved earnings forecasts. Over a span of five years, NVIDIA's total shareholder return, encompassing both share price and dividends, was very large at 1420.04%. In comparison, the company outperformed the broader US semiconductor industry over the last year, with an annual return of 80% compared to the industry\u2019s 11.7%. The recent advancements have directly impacted investor sentiment, potentially reinforcing expectations for NVIDIA's financial trajectory. Despite trading above the current share price, NVIDIA's stock is still at a 30.4% discount to the analyst consensus price target of US$163.12, indicating potential upside. Analysts' expectations of a 21.2% annual earnings growth offer a strong basis for the company\u2019s future valuation, assuming the operational challenges tied to Blackwell systems and regulatory uncertainties are managed effectively. Overall, the company's strategic developments suggest promising implications for its business outlook in the coming years.

        "content": "Important data releases happen with frequency on Wall Street. A seemingly endless parade of earnings reports, economic data releases, and policy changes from the Donald Trump administration, can make it easy for something important to get overlooked by investors. Arguably the most-telling of all data releases occurred three weeks ago on May 15. This marked the deadline for institutional investors overseeing at least $100 million in assets to fileForm 13Fwith the Securities and Exchange Commission. A 13F provides investors with a snapshot of which stocks Wall Street's smartest money managers bought and sold in the latest quarter (in this case, the first quarter). WhileWarren Buffett is the most-followed asset manager on Wall Street, he's far from the only billionaire investor with a phenomenal track record. Coatue Management's Philippe Laffont, who closed out March with $22.7 billion in assets under management, has a propensity for making money in the stock market. Image source: Getty Images. Whereas Buffett is a staunch value investor, Laffont leans heavily into growth stocks and companies riding the latest technological waves, such as theartificial intelligence (AI)revolution. Although Laffont ended March overseeing 70 stocks, just four of these positions (all AI stocks) account for roughly 30% of Coatue's invested assets. Interestingly enough, AI leaderNvidia(NVDA0.68%)isn'tamong these top AI assets, with Laffont persistently selling shares of Nvidia over the last two years. Though Nvidia was Coatue's largest holding from April 1, 2023 \u2013 Dec. 31, 2023, acombination of profit-taking and other possible nefarious factorshas led to a notable reduction in this position. In four of the last five quarters,social media titanMeta Platforms(META0.23%)has been billionaire Philippe Laffont's top holding. Coatue's more than 3.75-million-share stake equated to almost $2.2 billion in market value at the end of March. While Meta is wagering heavily on an AI future, thelion's share of its revenue and profits are currently derived from advertising. In March, Meta's family of apps, which includes Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Threads, and Facebook Messenger, attracted an average of 3.43 billion daily active people. Since no other social platform comes particularly close to luring as many people on a daily basis, businesses are eager to advertise on Meta's social media sites. In turn, Meta often enjoys significant ad-pricing power. Mark Zuckerberg's company is already deploying generative AI solutions within its advertising platform. Giving businesses access to generative AI allows them to personalize their message(s) to specific users, with the hope of improving click-through rates. Meta Platforms also has the luxury of an enviable treasure chest. Its cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities collectively topped $70 billion at the end of March, and the company's operations generated over $24 billion in net cash through the first three months of the year. Meta has the luxury of aggressively investing in AI, as well as slow-stepping the rollout of new services, thanks to its pristine balance sheet. Image source: Amazon. The only quarter where Meta Platforms wasn't the No. 1 holding for Coatue Management since the start of 2024 (the fourth quarter of 2024) sawe-commerce kingpinAmazon(AMZN0.91%)take hold of the top spot. Amazon has been a top-four holding for Laffont's fund for eight consecutive quarters. Coatue's billionaire chief is more than likely attracted to the rapid growth in Amazon's cloud infrastructure service platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS). According to estimates from tech analysis firm Canalys, AWS entered 2025 accounting for a 33% share of global cloud infrastructure service spending. Based on Amazon's first-quarter operating results,AWS is pacing $117 billion in annual run-rate revenue. Amazon hasn't been shy about incorporating generative AI solutions into AWS. It's also giving customers the tools to build and deploy large language models (LLMs). LLMs can be used to answer queries as virtual agents and summarize text, while generative AI can improve various marketing aspects for businesses. Amazon's other high-growth ancillary segments, which includes subscription services (e.g., Prime) and advertising services, are playing key roles in its growth, too.Winning exclusive sports streaming deals with the NFL and NBAshould afford Prime plenty of subscription pricing power. Meanwhile, attracting billions of visitors on a monthly basis is great news for the company's advertising operations. The third largest holding in billionaire Philippe Laffont's fund for a second consecutive quarter is world-leading chip fabrication companyTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(TSM0.87%), which is commonly referred to as \"TSMC.\" Even though Coatue's 13F shows that roughly 2 million shares of TSMC were sold during the first quarter, it still accounts for close to 6% of invested assets. Taiwan Semi can be best thought of as a critical part of the AI-data center supply chain. Its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate (CoWoS) technology is necessary for the packaging of high-bandwidth memory needed in AI-accelerated data centers. TSMC is in the process of increasing its CoWoS capacity from around 35,000 units per month in 2024to 135,000 wafers per month by 2026. This should go a long way to resolving the AI-graphics processing unit (GPU) scarcity that's allowed Nvidia to charge a veritable arm and leg for its Hopper and Blackwell GPUs. Laffont's sizable wager on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing might also have to do with it building advanced-chip production facilities in the U.S. President Trump's threat of imposing tariffs on imports, including the possibility of semiconductor tariffs, is more of a moot point with TSMC investing in America. Something else worth noting is thatTSMC is more than just AI chips. While advanced computing does comprise a majority of Taiwan Semi's net sales, it remains a key player in chip production for smartphones, Internet of Things devices, and next-generation vehicles. This revenue diversification might provide some buffer to Taiwan Semiconductor stockif an AI bubble forms and bursts. The fourth AI stock that, collectively with Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, accounts for about 30% of Coatue Management's $22.7 billion in invested assets isMicrosoft(MSFT0.68%). Microsoft was Laffont's fifth-largest holding at the end of March, and it's been a top-five position in each of the last eight quarters. Similar to Meta and Amazon, Microsoft's artificial intelligence ties have to do with applying this game-changing technology to existing solutions. For instance,Azure is the world's No. 2 cloud infrastructure service platform by total spending, behind only AWS. Microsoft is aggressively deploying generative AI and LLM tools in Azure for its clients. In turn, it's seeing sales growth for Azure remain firmly in the double-digits (35% year-over-year growth on a constant currency basis for the March-ended quarter). Microsoft's legacy operations aren't slouches, either. Even though the growth heyday for Windows and Office is long gone, Microsoft's software still dominates on desktops and laptops. These sustainable, high-margin operating segments generate plenty of cash flow that the company can redirect toward cloud and AI initiatives, or perhaps Microsoft's bountiful capital-return program. Additionally, Microsoft is swimming in cash, which allows for an aggressive level of innovation and acquisitions that most companies can't match. It ended March with $79.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, while generating $37 billion in net cash from operations in just three months.",

        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) stocks scored major gains over the past two years as investors bet on the power of the technology to revolutionize the world -- from our daily lives to how companies operate. Many companies selling products and services to power AI platforms and companies developing AI have seen both revenue and their share prices soar. And early investors in such players have benefited. Now the good news is, even after recent declines in these growth players, it looks as if the AI story is far from over. In fact, we may be in the early phases of gains, and much more might lie ahead. Analysts predict that today's $300 billion market could surpass $2 trillion early next decade, offering many companies a huge opportunity. But this doesn't mean we have to wait that long for another big wave of AI-driven stock market gains. I'm optimistic about these growth players' earnings prospects and share performance potential for this year -- and one company in particular could be well positioned to excel. My prediction is this AI stock will be the biggest winner of 2025. Image source: Getty Images. So, first, a quick note about why AI stocks have declined in recent weeks. It hasn't been linked to any slowdown in this hot technology or problem for any single company. Instead, it's related to general concerns about economic growth, triggered by President Trump's plan to impose tariffs on imports. Investors have worried that higher prices on goods could lift costs for companies -- and prompt their customers to spend less. But indexes and stocks have recovered some of their losses amid positive news: The U.S. has struck initial trade deals with the U.K. and China, and talks are under way with other countries too. There's also optimism that tariff levels won't be as high as originally expected and that any eventual tariffs on electronics -- exempted so far -- will be at reasonable levels. Against this backdrop, my prediction is AI chip leaderNvidia(NVDA0.68%)will be the biggest winner of 2025. Why am I so confident about this stock in particular? Nvidia has proved it can quickly adapt to challenges thrown its way. For example, when the U.S. originally launched export controls on AI chips to China, Nvidia developed a chip that met guidelines -- and in more recent days, as Trump spoke of his import tariff plan, Nvidia launched an initiative to invest in manufacturing in the U.S., a move that will eventually make it less sensitive to any such duties. This resourcefulness and ability to tackle problems is an asset during periods of uncertainty and should offer investors confidence in the company. And Nvidia's $53 billion in cash means it has the financial resources to support growth and handle challenges. I'm also confident about Nvidia's ability to stand out this year thanks to messages from its major customers: They planto keep on spendingheavily on AI, and because of their interest in building the strongest AI platforms possible, it's likely much of that business will go to Nvidia. Companies includingMicrosoft,Amazon, andMeta Platformsrecently have confirmed their AI growth plans, dispelling investors' concerns that a slowdown in AI spending may be on the horizon. On top of this, Nvidia has reported solid growth through the first quarter and high demand for something that could spur the next wave of revenue growth: inference power. Reasoning models \"think over\" problems longer to produce better answers and need top graphics processing units (GPUs) to supercharge this process. Nvidia's GPUs are the most powerful around, and the company's new Blackwell architecture was constructed with inferencing needs in mind -- so this should drive considerable growth for Nvidia in the quarters to come. Of course, even the brightest of situations include some uncertainties or risks, and in Nvidia's case the biggest right now isits future in China. The U.S. has barred sales of its H20 chip, designed to specifically meet earlier export guidelines, and that resulted in a $4.5 billion charge for the company in the recent quarter. Nvidia has spoken openly about how restricting sales of AI chips to China not only would limit its sales growth but would hurt the U.S.'s potential for dominance in the industry. I'm optimistic that the Trump administration, that's expressed its support for AI, will listen to Nvidia's message and find a solution that won't penalize U.S. companies. But until a solution is found, this represents a risk for Nvidia. Still, even with that risk present, Nvidia stock could soar this year for the reasons I've mentioned above and any potential positive news about exports to China also could serve as a catalyst. Finally, valuation may offer this player a boost too. The stock, up about 2% this year, is trading for only 32 timesforward earnings estimates, down from about 50 just a few months ago. This bargain valuation could increase appetite for the stock, especially for investors who aim to hold on for the long term. So my prediction is this top AI chip powerhouse will roar higher this year and become the biggest winner of 2025 -- and the great news is even if I'm wrong, Nvidia still is well positioned to soar over the long run.",

        "content": "We recently published a list ofJim Cramer Talked About These 16 Stocks Recently. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discussed recently. A caller inquired about Cramer\u2019s thoughts on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). Here is what he said: \u201cI think Jensen makes a very compelling case when he argues that we should let NVIDIA sell those chips to the Chinese because otherwise China will indeed invest much more heavily in their own semiconductor industry. Wouldn\u2019t it be better to blunt China\u2019s efforts to leapfrog us and keep them dependent on our chips, the same way we\u2019re depending on their rare earth minerals? Sadly, the White House says no. I think it makes a ton of sense.\u201d NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) develops advanced computing, graphics, and networking solutions, offering products and software for AI, gaming, data centers, robotics, and automotive technologies. On May 13, Cramer said that President Trump\u2019s policy shift initially hurt the company, but later boosted its stock by opening up major new markets, as he said: \u201cAs those who shorted the market now realize, the President\u2019s pivot was wildly bullish for the very companies that had previously been hit the hardest. Take NVIDIA. On the one hand, Trump effectively forced NVIDIA to take a $5.5 billion charge for chips it could no longer sell to China. On the other hand, he\u2019s now out there helping NVIDIA sell chips to some of the biggest clients in the world, the Gulf monarchies. NVIDIA stock has made a historic comeback [buy, buy, buy]\u2026 It\u2019s a big deal for the Saudis because they weren\u2019t on the arbitrary, capricious list of 18 friendly countries that President Biden approved to buy NVIDIA\u2019s best technology.

        "content": "Investors are always looking for smart money managers to get ideas from. One investor I like to follow is David Tepper, the billionaire founder of Appaloosa Management. And, fortunately, I can get information on Appaloosa's trades following the end of each calendar quarter, when institutional investment firms managing over $100 million in stocks are required to file aform 13Fwith the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The 13F is a public record of which stocks portfolio management firms bought and sold during the most recent quarter. This can be a useful tool, as it helps investors get an idea of what opportunities the \"smart money\" on Wall Street may prefer. Per Appaloosa's latest 13F, the firm has exited its position inAdvanced Micro Devicesand initiated a position inBroadcom(AVGO0.42%). Let's explore what may have motivated Tepper's firm to dump AMD stock and swap it for Broadcom. Given Appaloosa's prior trading history, the firm's reduced exposure to AMD is hardly a surprise. Data source: Hedge Follow. With the exception of a small buy during the fourth quarter of 2024, Appaloosa had steadily been trimming its AMD position prior to completely exiting it earlier this year. While AMD is somewhat diversified, the company is facing a number of challenges right now. For starters,two of the company's core businesses have been deceleratingfor a while now. And despite some impressive traction in its data center GPU operation, the company still trailsNvidiaby miles. Sure, AMD has a number of new chipsets that are scheduled to be released during the second half of this year and during 2026,. However, so does Nvidia. This means that despite its innovative efforts, AMD is likely going to continue facing an uphill battle in the data center chip market thanks to Nvidia's commanding lead. Given the unpredictability of its growth prospects, perhaps Tepper decided to move on. Image\u00a0 source: Getty Images. I like Tepper's decision to get in on Broadcom stock for several reasons. First, Broadcom is a diversified operation -- boasting26 different business units. The company specializes in supplying network equipment that's critical for outfitting AI data centers. The company is also a rising star in thecustom siliconmovement. In addition, a couple of months ago, Broadcom's management announced that the company's board of directors had approved a new$10 billion share repurchase program. Typically, when a company decides to buy back its own stock, management feels that shares may be undervalued and is bullish about the company's future growth prospects. Lastly, Broadcom is still in the early phases of monetizing several new assets from its VMware acquisition. I see Broadcom as a unique opportunity in the AI infrastructure realm. The company has the ability to benefit from multiple expanding markets stitched together through AI, but does not hinge on a particular product or service offering. Trading at aforward price-to-earnings(P/E) multiple of 36.4, Broadcom stock isn't exactly a bargain. Taking advantage of the depressed price action throughout the first quarter, as Appaloosa apparently did, is already looking like a savvy move.  AVGO PE Ratio (Forward)data byYCharts With that said, investors shouldn't focus too much on when exactly they buy a stock. Timing your buys is often an exercise in false precision, especially for investors with long time horizons. The big-picture theme is thatAI capital expendituresare on the rise. This is a multiyear tailwind that bodes well for Broadcom and its various businesses. To me, the company's next phase of growth is still in the early innings and I seeBroadcom stock as a no-brainer buyright now.",

        "header": "Prediction: 3 Stocks That'll Be Worth More Than Microsoft 10 Years From Now",
        "content": "Microsoft(MSFT0.68%)first became the world's biggest company based on market cap in September 1998. It stayed No. 1 for less than 18 months before being dethroned. But the software giant has clawed its way back to the top in 2025. I don't think Microsoft's reign will last very long this time, either. What's more, I predict that the following three stocks will be worth more than Microsoft 10 years from now. Image source: Getty Images. I suspectNvidia(NVDA0.68%)will move past Microsoft quite soon. It could even happen in a matter of days or weeks. Nvidia is certainly in the best position to knock Microsoft off its perch with its market cap already topping $3.3 trillion. What will it take for Nvidia to take the top spot? Not much. Any hiccup with Microsoft's business could be enough to enable Nvidia to regain the position it briefly held last year as the world's largest company based on market cap. However, I don't think Microsoft has to stumble for it to happen. Nvidia is poised to be the biggest beneficiary of several artificial intelligence (AI) trends, notably including the rapid adoption of AI agents that can reason. These AI agents require enormous computing power. Nvidia'sGPUsremain the most powerful chips on the market forAI inferenceused by AI agents. It won't surprise me in the least if Nvidia becomes the first company with a market cap of $5 trillion. Sure, the restrictions on AI chip exports to China will hurt its growth to some extent. However, I don't think this headwind will keep Nvidia from becoming much larger over the next decade. Apple(AAPL0.15%)dominated as the world's largest company throughout most of the last 10 years. Microsoft was its main rival for the No. 1 position during this period. Although Apple's market cap is now smaller than both Microsoft's and Nvidia's, I think the iPhone maker won't be in third place or lower by 2035. The big question hovering over Apple is: What's the next big breakthrough product for the company? Apple Watch has been successful, but it isn't in the same league as the iPhone. Apple's Vision Pro mixed-reality headset has been a commercial disappointment. Itsgenerative AIfunctionality, branded as Apple Intelligence, hasn't provided the spark that many investors hoped it would, either. I think smart glasses just might be the much-anticipated next huge hit for Apple. Rumors are circulating that the company plans to launch its first AI-enhanced glasses as early as late 2026. These glasses will compete againstMeta PlatformsRay-Ban AI glasses. But Apple is also reportedly working on smart glasses that support augmented reality (AR). This could be the real game-changer for the company. If Tim Cook and his team can leverage some of the technology used on Vision Pro, Apple just might be able to launch smart glasses that become nearly as must-have as the iPhone years ago. Amazon(AMZN0.91%)has never been the world's largest company. It doesn't necessarily have to be to leap past Microsoft over the next 10 years, though. It wasn't too long ago that I thought Microsoft would be able to retain its market cap advantage over Amazon for years to come. Why have I changed my mind? Mainly because I suspect that Amazon Web Services (AWS) will be able to hold on to its leadership in the cloud services market more strongly than I anticipated in the past. Part of my shifting opinion is due to Microsoft's seemingly deteriorating relationship with OpenAI. Without OpenAI's ChatGPT, I don't believe Microsoft would claim the largest market cap today. The less tight the bond between the two companies, the less confidence I have that Microsoft Azure will be able to narrow the market share gap with AWS. Another reason why I'm more optimistic about Amazon now, though, is that the company continues to fire on all cylinders. Its AI initiatives are impressive, including the development of its own AI chips. The company's focus on the bottom line is paying off. Amazon is also expanding into new businesses, with the recent launch of its Project Kuiper satellites that will provide global internet access serving as a great example. Granted, Amazon must grow significantly faster than Microsoft over the next 10 years for its market cap to become larger. However, I predict that's exactly what will happen.",

Early on, like with any new and ground-breaking technology, there were AI skeptics, but by now, most of Wall Street has caught on to just how big the AI revolution will be and how we are likely only in the early innings of it. For instance, the market cap ofNvidiahas exploded to $2.31 trillion amid exploding demand for its high-powered graphic processing units (GPUs) necessary to train large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT orAlphabet\u2019sGemini. Furthermore, a blistering pace of AI headlines has stolen the show from other industries. This morning,Constellation Energylanded a 20-year deal to supply nuclear energy toMeta Platform\u2019smassive data centers. It\u2019s becoming abundantly clear for growth investors that AI will be the top growth area in the market. Just as innovations like the internet boom of the late 1990s provided life-changing investments, there will be fortunes to be made for savvy growth investors in the next \u201cindustrial revolution.\u201d But for those investors looking to go from coach to first class, it\u2019s not enough to merely focus on the mega-cap tech behemoths because, after all, it\u2019s more difficult to multi-bag winners in a mega-cap stock. Like the internet and previous tech booms, obscure market segments will likely provide the most fruitful returns. As mentioned, Chatbots or LLMs have been the primary focus for investors thus far in the AI revolution for three reasons: \u00b7Client Facing:Chatbots like ChatGPT and Gemini are tangible for investors. \u00b7CAPEX Spending:Billions in CAPEX spending from Mag 7 names has led to a bull market in energy (to supply energy-hungry data centers) and data center equipment (to train LLMs) \u00b7Public vs Private:Many AI firms focused outside of LLMs are not yet public or are obscure. While many non-LLM AI companies are small or not yet public, investors should prepare for the future and \u201cskate to where the puck is going,\u201d as the great Wayne Gretzky once said. Today, we will address that last bullet point and provide two examples of non-LLM companies disrupting legacy industries. An example of an AI start-up worth watching is privately held Propense.ai. The Miami-based AI-powered B2B cross-selling platform combines AI technology with data science, user psychology, human behavior, and industry insights to anticipate client needs. Propense is a fantastic example of the dizzying pace at which the AI revolution is taking hold.Roughly a year ago, we covered how Propense.ai closed a successful $3 million seed funding round.It didn\u2019t end there. Not long after,Propense.ai doubled down on its professional services focus with a landmark investment from Thomson Reuters Ventures. Today, Propense announced that it has gained a foothold in the law industry. It signed three AM Law 200 firms with a combined 2,000+ attorneys to its beta program to develop a data-backed solution promoting collaboration across siloed practice groups. (AM Law 200 firms represent the top 200 US-based law firms by revenue). The news is a significant win for Propense, which has already succeeded in the accounting sector, serving some 12% of IPA Top 100 firms. In a statement, Propense Founder and CEO Tim Keith explained how Propense parlayed its accounting business into law: \u201cLaw firms have the same fundamental challenge as accounting firms: they struggle to understand the breadth of their clients\u2019 needs and act on that intelligence across as many groups and offices as possible.\u201d Keith continued, \u201cWe\u2019ve seen what\u2019s possible in the accounting space, and we\u2019re ready to bring that same transformation to law firms with a tool developed specifically for legal professionals and the way they work.\u201d The announcement comes ahead of the Legal Sales & Service Organization\u2019s RainDance Conference in Chicago on June 4-5. Propense, a sponsor of the event, will meet with legal, marketing, and business development professionals seeking innovative tech solutions to support their sales goals. You can learn more about Propense here. While Propense is still a private company, some non-LLM-focused public firms are beginning to gain momentum. For instance,Tempus AIbolted more than 15% Monday as trading volume swelled to more than double the norm after the company announced that it would launch AI agents directly into electronic healthcare records (EHRs). With many hospitals still using outdated paperwork or digital software, TEM is poised to disrupt the healthcare industry. The AI revolution, initially met with skepticism, has unequivocally \"stolen the show\" on Wall Street, with companies like Nvidia experiencing monumental growth and AI headlines dominating the news cycle. While large language models have been the primary focus, the real asymmetric returns for savvy growth investors will likely come from discovering and investing in lesser-known AI segments disrupting legacy industries. Companies like Propense.ai, with its AI-powered B2B cross-selling platform gaining traction in the legal and accounting sector, are a trend to watch.

        "header": "Bull of the Day: ABB (ABBNY)",
        "content": "ABB(ABBNY) is a $100 billion Zurich-based industrial company that specializes in electrification and automation. ABB's products and services help manufacturers and governments achieve greater efficiency, energy management, and sustainability.Companies with some similar business lines might includeEaton(ETN), Siemens, and Johnson Controls. But ABB stands out with its robotics division. And they get to do \"cool\" stuff at the world's premier particle physics accelerator. ABB and CERN, the European Laboratory for Particle Physics, identified in 2024 significant energy-saving potential through a strategic research partnership focused on the cooling and ventilation system at one of the world\u2019s leading laboratories for particle physics in Geneva, Switzerland. The study included energy efficiency audits which helped identify a savings potential of 17.4% across a fleet of 800 motors.ABB's four business segments --Electrification, Robotics & Discrete Automation, Process Automation, and Motion-- are approaching a combined $35 billion in sales this year at modest 6-7% growth. What made ABB a Zacks #2 Rank recently was EPS estimates climbing to 13.6% growth after a first quarter 11% positive surprise.I wanted to learn more about their business after I found they were one of the top holdings in theGlobal X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF(BOTZ).Turns out that ABB has interesting plans. On April 17 the company announced that it will launch a process to propose to its Annual General Meeting in 2026 to decide on a 100% spin-off of its Robotics division. The intention is for the business to start trading as a separately listed company during the second quarter of 2026.From Electricity to AI, 140 Years of InnovationThis robotics spin-off is interesting because as I dove into the history of ABB, I see that they developed a unique operational structure and approach in the past five years.In 2020, the company introduced the \"ABB Way\" operating model, decentralizing the company. Henceforth, the company\u2019s 20-odd divisions assumed the highest operating level, with full accountability for their strategies, resources and performance.So it makes sense that a division entering a new era of possibility would want to stand completely alone as it evolves.In 2015, ABB introduced YuMi, the world's first truly collaborative robot, capable of working safely alongside human beings.And the company's roots go back 130 years prior to Sweden where a company called ASEA was building the world's first three-phase systems for generators, transformers and motors.Meanwhile in 1893, a Swiss company called BBC supplied Europe\u2019s first large-scale combined heat and power plant producing alternating current.It's fascinating to know the European story of innovation that was jump-started by the discoveries in electromagnetism of James Clerk Maxwell only two decades before.After a century of innovating independently, in 1988 ABB was formed from the merger of ASEA of Sweden and BBC of Switzerland. The new company, headquartered in Zurich, had annual revenues of $17 billion and 160,000 employees at the time.The US Footprint is Big and WideNow they have 110,000 employees (subsequent of various M&A including buying GE Industrial and selling its Power Grids segment to Hitachi) and maintain 170 manufacturing sites around globally.In the US, ABB employs over 18,500 staff at 40+ manufacturing and assembly locations, from the northeast, across the southeast and Midwest, to the newest facility in New Mexico.Electrification is headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia and Robotics & Discrete Automation is in Auburn Hills, Michigan.Motion (think motors, drives and generator products) is based in Fort Smith, Arkansas and Process Automation (think digital control technologies for plant operations) is steered from Houston, Texas.ABB claims that their Process Automation segment -- providing software, advanced services, and analytics to help customers create their own \"safe and smart operations\" -- is #2 in the market globally.Robotics = Physical AIAs my readers and fellow investors know, I followNVIDIA(NVDA) pretty closely and we are now in a phase of fully exploring what Jensen means by \"physical AI.\"Essentially, when intelligence crosses the threshold to \"embody\" an autonomous machine, whether car or robot, the rules change a lot. Because now human safety hangs in the balance.At the Computex conference in Taiwan last month, NVIDIA unveiled three vectors to address the challenge: Isaac GR00T N1.5, the first update to NVIDIA\u2019s open, generalized, fully customizable foundation model for humanoid reasoning and skills; NVIDIA Isaac GR00T-Dreams, a blueprint for generating synthetic motion data; and NVIDIA Blackwell systems to accelerate humanoid robot development.\"Physical AI and robotics will bring about the next industrial revolution,\" said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. \"From AI brains for robots to simulated worlds to practice in or AI supercomputers for training foundation models, NVIDIA provides building blocks for every stage of the robotics development journey.\"The ABB Spin-Off Will Chart a PathDozens of robotics startups are using NVIDIA tools to build the future of physical AI. And some of them will, if they make the cut, plan an IPO in the next few years.Here's how ABB describes their Robotics division...ABB Robotics is a technology leader and provides intelligent automation solutions to help its global customer base achieve improved productivity, flexibility and simplicity to solve operational challenges including labor shortages and the need to operate more sustainably. Customer value is created through the differentiated offering of the broadest robotics platforms, including Autonomous Mobile Robots, software and AI combined with proven domain expertise to a broad range of traditional and new industry segments. More than 80 percent of the offering is software/AI enabled.This \"IPO\" could be less than a year away. And it will be closely watched by all industry participants and AI investors.Here's what I told my TAZR Trader members on Tuesday when we bought a robotics company...\"The Biggest Industry in the History of the Planet\"We've already heard Jensen say that humanoid robots will be the next multi-trillion-dollar industry.Marc Andreessen doesn't talk much about NVIDIA. But he just uttered the above (in quotes) and he follows closely what Elon is doing withTesla(TSLA) Optimus and says general-purpose robotics is going to happen at giant scale in the next decade.So the US shouldn't try to get the old manufacturing jobs back -- instead, we should lean hard into designing and building robots before we are surrounded by ones designed by China.There's possible irony that robotics could be bigger than AI. Here's how one expert I follow describes it...\"In fact, robotics is often ignored in the discussion about AI. It will be the even more significant disruptive part, which was only made possible by AI. It is literally unimaginable how we will live in 10 years' time.\"Be sure to check out my Monday video and article here...The Week in AIwhere I talk about the next most important private robotics company (next to Tesla's Optimus).Note:This entire article was researched and written by yours truly without the aid of any \"chatterbot\" LLMs. Take that AI overlords!

The company is adding $100 billion to a previous $65 billion pledge, but without any additional funding from the government, Lutnick said. \u201cAre we renegotiating? Absolutely, for the benefit of the American taxpayer, for sure,\u201d Lutnick said Wednesday at a Senate Appropriations Committee. \u201cWe\u2019re getting more value for the same dollars.\u201d The Commerce secretary even suggested the administration may not follow through on some of the planned awards. \u201cYou will see that all the deals are getting better, and the only deals that are not getting done are deals that should have never been done in the first place,\u201d he said.

Lutnick has previously signaled that the Commerce Department might withhold Chips Act grants to press companies to follow in TSMC\u2019s footsteps and expand their planned domestic semiconductor projects. During his nearly two-hour appearance before the panel, Lutnick addressed a range of issues essential to the semiconductor industry, including the administration\u2019s push to bring to the US more chips-related investment. He defended artificial intelligence deals with the United Arab Emirates unveiled last month during President Donald Trump\u2019s trip to the Middle East, saying the accords were crafted to spur complementary levels of spending in the US. The path for those AI agreements in the Gulf was opened by the administration\u2019s decision to revoke a regulation launched during President Joe Biden\u2019s final week in office that had drawn strenuous objections from US allies and companies including Nvidia Corp. and Oracle Corp. The so-called AI diffusion rule \u2014 aimed at denying China access to advanced semiconductors via third parties \u2014 would have taken effect last month and created three broad tiers of access for countries seeking AI chips, an approach that Lutnick assailed a \u201cillogical.\u201d In its place, the Trump team is moving toward negotiating individual deals with countries while maintaining security guarantees designed to prevent Chinese companies from obtaining AI chips. \u201cOur view is we are going to allow our allies to buy AI chips, provided they\u2019re run by an approved American data center operator, and the cloud that touches that data center is an approved American operator,\u201d Lutnick said. Tensions over US efforts to rein in China\u2019s tech ambitions have deepened the conflict over trade between the world\u2019s two largest economies. Trump and Chinese officials have accused each other of violating the spirit of recent negotiations in Geneva, with leaders in Beijing objecting to American chip export controls and their counterparts in Washington expressing concerns over a crackdown by China on sales of critical minerals. The US has moved to pressure allies against adopting Huawei Technologies Co.\u2019s new Ascend chip, warning that any use risked violating export controls imposed by Washington. The Commerce Department said last month that it was issuing guidance to warn the public about \u201cthe potential consequences of allowing US AI chips to be used for training and inference of Chinese AI models.\u201d Lutnick insisted that China still lacks the capability to produce high volumes of sophisticated semiconductors, a sign that US export controls have limited China\u2019s technological progress. He estimated that China could probably produce about 200,000 advanced chips, like the kind used to train artificial-intelligence services or run smartphones, a tiny number compared with the country\u2019s demand. \u201cThey say they are making them and they are not,\u201d he said. --With assistance from Jamie Tarabay, Lynn Doan, Peter Elstrom and Debby Wu.

        "header": "Prediction: This Unstoppable Stock Will Be the World's First $5 Trillion Company. (Hint: It's Not Apple.)",
        "content": "WhileApplehistorically wins the race to various valuation milestones, I think a different company will beat it to the punch to the $5 trillion level, and no, it isn'tMicrosofteither. I believe thatNvidia(NVDA0.68%)will win this race, and thanks to its unwavering growth, it will leave both of these two in the dust in the march toward $5 trillion. Just how quickly will Nvidia reach that valuation milestone? It may be quicker than you think. Nvidia's impressive rise can be tied to one trend: artificial intelligence (AI). Nvidia's primary products aregraphics processing units (GPUs), which are high-powered computing devices that can process many calculations in parallel. GPUs can also be connected in clusters to amplify this effect, which is why you hear about AI supercomputing clusters being built with more than 100,000 GPUs. Nvidia is at the top of the GPU world, and most estimates point toward it having roughly a 90% market share. Few companies achieve that level of dominance, and no other company has ever been as dominant in a trend that is as important and quickly growing as AI. Nvidia's is truly an unprecedented story. That's why some investors (like me, in the past) underestimated Nvidia's potential. We've barely scratched the surface of what's possible with AI, and AI has yet to be fully integrated into workflows or personal life. This will require an unbelievable amount of computing power, which benefits Nvidia. A report by\u00a0Dell\u2019Oro Group says that 's data center capital expenditures in 2024 reached $455 billion, and Nvidia believes that number will it $1 trillion by 2028. If that's the case, then Nvidia's growth is far from over, something that its fiscal first-quarter results showcased. One thing that slightly affected Nvidia in the quarter was the loss of its China business. On April 9, the Trump administration established new rules that prevented Nvidia from selling H20 chips designed to meet the United States' previous export restrictions to China. This chip accounted for $4.6 billion of sales in Q1, which ended April 27, and Nvidia missed out on $2.5 billion in additional sales. Furthermore, the company expects about $8 billion in sales to be lost during the second quarter. This is unfortunate for Nvidia and hampers its growth case, but it provides some interesting numbers. For comparison's sake, let's add the lost $2.5 billion in sales to Q1's total and the $8 billion in Q2's projection. If we do that, these are the following growth rates that Nvidia would be posting (if it meets its guidance): Data source: Nvidia. Note: YOY = Year over year. For reference, during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025, Nvidia's growth rate was 78%. This clearly indicates a trend: Growth is accelerating despite Nvidia's massive size if the H20 sales are added back in for a proper comparison. Another point to note is that Nvidia's management tends to beat its internal revenue guidance, so these figures may be a bit conservative. Regardless, if the U.S. government didn't create some headwinds for Nvidia, its stock would be soaring due to accelerating revenue, but that gets buried behind the China story. Regardless, I think this is a bullish sign for investors, and this growth will likely persist for some time. Wall Street currently projects Nvidia will grow its revenue by just 26% next year, but I think that is an underprojection. Even if it does match Wall Street's expectations, it will generate around $250 billion in revenue. At Nvidia's currentprice-to-sales (P/S) ratio, that would value the company at over $5 trillion, so if it meets expectations (which I think it will blow away), it could reach that $5 trillion level as soon as next year. That growth makes Nvidia a screaming buy right now, asI think there's another growth story kicking off that investors aren't ready for.",

        "content": "Investing.com - Nvidia is still the best-positioned chipmaker to benefit from ongoing enthusiasm around artificial intelligence, even as the firm grapples with recent concerns around its Chinese business, analysts at Bank of America said in a note to clients on Thursday. Last week, the world\u2019s most valuable semiconductor firm unveiled quarterly sales that topped expectations thanks to customers stocking up on its AI chips prior to the implementation of new U.S. restrictions on exports of cutting-edge processors to China. The U.S. has placed strict rules around the export of these chips to China, as Washington hopes to limit Beijing\u2019s access to -- and harnessing of -- AI technology. For Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), this has particularly meant restrictions on the sale of its H20 chips to China, previously the only AI processor it was legally allowed to export to the country. Some $2.5 billion in H20 sales were lost in the first quarter, Nvidia flagged, while CFO Collette Kress said data center revenue in China slipped. Meanwhile, the California-based business noted that the curbs would lop some $8 million off sales in the current quarter, leading it to announce weaker-than-anticipated financial guidance. Still, the analysts at BofA said that, following an investor dinner with Kress and other Nvidia executives, China is now \"fully de-risked\" for the company, \"with no China-related sales in their current data center forecasts\". \"While there may be reports of follow-on products for the $50 billion AI total addressable China market, any sales from here are incremental,\" the brokerage added. According to Reuters, Nvidia has been preparing a variant of its Blackwell chips for China. U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to lift a so-called AI diffusion rule that would have limited the global flows of American AI chips also opens access to opportunities in other countries for Nvidia, the analysts argued. Last month, Nvidia inked a series of deals in the Middle East, including one pertaining to a 10-square mile data center in the United Arab Emirates. Other agreements have also been signed in Saudi Arabia. The BofA analysts maintained their \"buy\" rating of Nvidia\u2019s stock, which has risen by 2.6% so far this year despite deep equity market ructions. The strategists also named the firm as a \"top pick\" in the semiconductor sector, giving it a price target of $180. On Wednesday, Nvidia shares closed at $141.92.

        "content": "Chicago, IL \u2013 June 5, 2025 \u2013 Zacks Equity Research shares ABB ABBNY as the Bull of the Day and American Eagle Outfitters AEO as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Pinterest, Inc. PINS, Meta Platforms, Inc. META and Snap, Inc. SNAP. Here is a synopsis of all five stocks. ABBis a $100 billion Zurich-based industrial company that specializes in electrification and automation. ABB's products and services help manufacturers and governments achieve greater efficiency, energy management, and sustainability.Companies with some similar business lines might includeEaton(ETN), Siemens, and Johnson Controls. But ABB stands out with its robotics division. And they get to do \"cool\" stuff at the world's premier particle physics accelerator. ABB and CERN, the European Laboratory for Particle Physics, identified in 2024 significant energy-saving potential through a strategic research partnership focused on the cooling and ventilation system at one of the world\u2019s leading laboratories for particle physics in Geneva, Switzerland. The study included energy efficiency audits which helped identify a savings potential of 17.4% across a fleet of 800 motors.ABB's four business segments --Electrification, Robotics & Discrete Automation, Process Automation, and Motion-- are approaching a combined $35 billion in sales this year at modest 6-7% growth. What made ABB a Zacks #2 Rank recently was EPS estimates climbing to 13.6% growth after a first quarter 11% positive surprise.I wanted to learn more about their business after I found they were one of the top holdings in theGlobal X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF(BOTZ).Turns out that ABB has interesting plans. On April 17 the company announced that it will launch a process to propose to its Annual General Meeting in 2026 to decide on a 100% spin-off of its Robotics division. The intention is for the business to start trading as a separately listed company during the second quarter of 2026. This robotics spin-off is interesting because as I dove into the history of ABB, I see that they developed a unique operational structure and approach in the past five years.In 2020, the company introduced the \"ABB Way\" operating model, decentralizing the company. Henceforth, the company\u2019s 20-odd divisions assumed the highest operating level, with full accountability for their strategies, resources and performance.So it makes sense that a division entering a new era of possibility would want to stand completely alone as it evolves.In 2015, ABB introduced YuMi, the world's first truly collaborative robot, capable of working safely alongside human beings.And the company's roots go back 130 years prior to Sweden where a company called ASEA was building the world's first three-phase systems for generators, transformers and motors.Meanwhile in 1893, a Swiss company called BBC supplied Europe\u2019s first large-scale combined heat and power plant producing alternating current.It's fascinating to know the European story of innovation that was jump-started by the discoveries in electromagnetism of James Clerk Maxwell only two decades before.After a century of innovating independently, in 1988 ABB was formed from the merger of ASEA of Sweden and BBC of Switzerland. The new company, headquartered in Zurich, had annual revenues of $17 billion and 160,000 employees at the time. Now they have 110,000 employees (subsequent of various M&A including buying GE Industrial and selling its Power Grids segment to Hitachi) and maintain 170 manufacturing sites around globally.In the US, ABB employs over 18,500 staff at 40+ manufacturing and assembly locations, from the northeast, across the southeast and Midwest, to the newest facility in New Mexico.Electrification is headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia and Robotics & Discrete Automation is in Auburn Hills, Michigan.Motion (think motors, drives and generator products) is based in Fort Smith, Arkansas and Process Automation (think digital control technologies for plant operations) is steered from Houston, Texas.ABB claims that their Process Automation segment -- providing software, advanced services, and analytics to help customers create their own \"safe and smart operations\" -- is #2 in the market globally. As my readers and fellow investors know, I follow NVIDIA pretty closely and we are now in a phase of fully exploring what Jensen means by \"physical AI.\"Essentially, when intelligence crosses the threshold to \"embody\" an autonomous machine, whether car or robot, the rules change a lot. Because now human safety hangs in the balance.At the Computex conference in Taiwan last month, NVIDIA unveiled three vectors to address the challenge: Isaac GR00T N1.5, the first update to NVIDIA\u2019s open, generalized, fully customizable foundation model for humanoid reasoning and skills; NVIDIA Isaac GR00T-Dreams, a blueprint for generating synthetic motion data; and NVIDIA Blackwell systems to accelerate humanoid robot development.\"Physical AI and robotics will bring about the next industrial revolution,\" said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. \"From AI brains for robots to simulated worlds to practice in or AI supercomputers for training foundation models, NVIDIA provides building blocks for every stage of the robotics development journey.\" Dozens of robotics startups are using NVIDIA tools to build the future of physical AI. And some of them will, if they make the cut, plan an IPO in the next few years.Here's how ABB describes their Robotics division...ABB Robotics is a technology leader and provides intelligent automation solutions to help its global customer base achieve improved productivity, flexibility and simplicity to solve operational challenges including labor shortages and the need to operate more sustainably. Customer value is created through the differentiated offering of the broadest robotics platforms, including Autonomous Mobile Robots, software and AI combined with proven domain expertise to a broad range of traditional and new industry segments. More than 80 percent of the offering is software/AI enabled.This \"IPO\" could be less than a year away. And it will be closely watched by all industry participants and AI investors.Here's what I told my TAZR Trader members on Tuesday when we bought a robotics company... We've already heard Jensen say that humanoid robots will be the next multi-trillion-dollar industry.Marc Andreessen doesn't talk much about NVIDIA. But he just uttered the above (in quotes) and he follows closely what Elon is doing withTesla(TSLA) Optimus and says general-purpose robotics is going to happen at giant scale in the next decade.So the US shouldn't try to get the old manufacturing jobs back -- instead, we should lean hard into designing and building robots before we are surrounded by ones designed by China.There's possible irony that robotics could be bigger than AI. Here's how one expert I follow describes it...\"In fact, robotics is often ignored in the discussion about AI. It will be the even more significant disruptive part, which was only made possible by AI. It is literally unimaginable how we will live in 10 years' time.\"Be sure to check out my Monday video and article here...The Week in AIwhere I talk about the next most important private robotics company (next to Tesla's Optimus).Note:This entire article was researched and written by yours truly without the aid of any \"chatterbot\" LLMs. Take that AI overlords! Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stockAmerican Eagle Outfittersis a Pittsburgh-based specialty casual apparel retailer. American Eagle Outfitters offers accessories and footwear for men and women, with a main target demographic of people between 15 and 25 years old. The company and its subsidiaries design and market casual clothing including jeans, cargo pants, graphic T-shirts, outerwear, and other accessories. AEO has three main brands, including: \u00b7AE Brand:Under this brand, the company sells the latest fashion apparel and accessories for men and women in the 15 to 25 age group. \u00b7Aerie by American Eagle:Launched in 2006, Aerie is a lifestyle brand that provides simple and stylish apparel, especially for young girls. The company sells apparel through its standalone Aerie stores across the United States and Canada and globally through its online channel, aerie.com. \u00b7AEO Direct:AEO Direct is American Eagle\u2019s online retailing channel, through which it sells a wide range of apparel and accessories from its different brands. The company merchandises its products through e-commerce websites, ae.com and aerie.com. The number of malls in the US has dropped precipitously over the past few decades from more than 2,000 in the 1980s to roughly 700 today. While there has been a slight resurgence in the beginning of 2025, mall foot traffic has exhibited a troubling downtrend over the past five years in the wake of the COVIDD-19 pandemic and a shift to online shopping. Though AEO operates an e-commerce website, it is heavily reliant on its brick-and-mortar stores, which represent about two-thirds of its revenue. President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cLiberation Day\u201d threw a wrench into businesses like American Eagle. The company sources its close from several tariff-impacted countries including China, Vietnam, Mexico, and Indonesia to name a few. AEO shares are showing troubling relative price action versus the S&P 500 Index. Year-to-date, shares are down nearly 40%, while the S&P 500 is flat. A challenging retail landscape and aggressive promotional strategies contribute to American Eagle\u2019s poor performance. For instance, Abercrombie & Fitch,a casual apparel retailer that serves a similar crowd to AEO, expects EPS to jump 70% in 2025 compared to AEO\u2019s 14%. Markets are generally forward-looking. However, Wall Street analysts see negative EPS growth this year and AEO\u2019s EPS to plunge by 52% next year! \u201cThe death of the mall,\u201d ongoing tariff impacts, and relative price weakness paint a challenging picture for casual apparel retailer American Eagle Outfitters. Pinterest, Inc. is witnessing consistent user growth across all regions in the past several quarters. In the first quarter of 2025, global monthly active users (MAUs) reached 570 million, a record high for the company.

        "header": "The Trump Trade Is the 'TACO Trade' Now. Is It a Safe Bet?",
        "content": "The \u201cTrump Trade\u201d has evolved. How investors should play it is up for debate. The early days of President Donald Trump\u2019s second administration supercharged a climb in stocks that started late last summer, lifting the major indexes and some specific assets\u2014shares of Tesla (TSLA), cryptocurrency\u2014in particular. Sprinkled in was volatility around stock and sectors seen as likely to be helped or hurt by spending and regulatory efforts. Some of that remains in place, but the action these days is largely around global trade policy. Investors are attempting to figure out from day to day what the next twist in Trump\u2019s tariff strategy could be and how it might affect stocks in the hours, days and weeks ahead. That\u2019s taken on particular salience since stocks swooned after the April 2 \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariff announcements and then beganworking their way back. The upshot, for some, is the belief that Trump eventually delays or otherwise modifies policies the market doesn't like, so trade-policy negativity will be shaken off before long. There\u2019s an alliterative nickname for this: the \u201cTACO Trade,\u201d short for \u201cTrump Always Chickens Out,\u201d coined last month by aFinancial Timescolumnist. (Asked about it at a press conference, Trump was unamused.) Discussion of the term has taken on a political character and become fodder for TheWall Street Journal,The New York Times, and other publications\u2014now including this one\u2014but it has also found its way to the lips of investors and analysts. BCA Research mentioned it in a note earlier this week, calling the trade \u201covercooked\u201d and suggesting that investors may have grown too sanguine. \u201cRisk assets price in trade deals and de-escalation along with limited policy damage despite ongoing volatility,\u201d they wrote. Pepperstone analyst Michael Brown in late May effectively equated taco trading withbuying the dip. Deutsche Bank analysts intheir own notethis week didn\u2019t use the taco term, but\u2014in raising their year-end target for the S&P 500\u2014cited the idea that \u201cthe administration had already relented, driven primarily by the market reaction, and before the emergence of significant economic or political pain. This reinforces the view that if negative impacts of tariffs do materialize, we will get further relents.\u201d Other factors have undoubtedly aided stocks in recent weeks even as questions about the path forward for trade and the economy remain. The first-quarter earnings season was generally seen as strong, and Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA)results and outlookhave supported the AI trade. Futures markets indicate an expectation that the Federal Reserve cuts rates twice by the end of the year, as the job market shows signs of weakness and inflation approaches the Fed\u2019s target. JP Morgan analysts on Tuesday shared a calendar of key trade dates in the coming months, noting a litany of summits and policy expirations\u2014a 90-day pause on tariffs against the EU expires next month, and reducedU.S.-China tariffsare set to pass in August\u2014between now and the end of the year. The administration reportedly asked countries to submit their \u201cbest offers\u201d in trade negotiations by Wednesday. Some investors don\u2019t buy the inevitability of bullishness around trade news. \u201cWe think that, unfortunately, as the so-called \u2018TACO Trade\u2019 becomes more viral, it becomes more likely that Trump will stick to higher tariffs just to prove a point,\u201d Panmure Liberum Head of Strategy Joachim Klement recently told aReutersinterviewer. In short, it may not pay to oversimplify the effect that trade could have on markets in the coming months. \u201cThere are no signs of a summer break from tariff drama,\u201d JP Morgan wrote.",

        "content": "Gamers can finally get their hands on Switch 2. Nintendo released its first new console system in eight years at midnight, capping off months of excitement\u2014and some apprehension, as Americans looking to snag one of the souped-up systems weathered delays and a competitive pre-order process. Those who managed to buy a Switch 2 online before it hit stores are celebrating, as are retailers anticipating a rush in foot traffic now that they have the system in stock. Nintendo fan Jesus Garcia, who said he planned to pick up his preordered console at Best Buy (BBY) early today, toldInvestopediahe was excited to see \u201cthe new experiences\u201d embedded in Switch 2. Garcia, who lives in Texas and supervises a claims team for a trucking company, said he'd planned to take the day off to play the newest \"Mario Kart\" game. Best Buy planned to keeping stores open late and hand out commemorative coins with the Switch\u2019s logo, according to its website.GameStop (GME) started celebrating the release at 3 p.m. Wednesday, with \u201cinteractive demos, giveaways, and Mario Kart-themed surprises,\u201d the company said in an email. Target (TGT) said it would use tickets to manage traffic in its electronics section. Garcia stayed up late to place a preorder in late April, a transaction he said took more than half an hour. Other consumersweren\u2019t so lucky, and complained that retailers\u2019 sites crashed or quickly sold out. The preorder process wasdelayed domesticallyby about two weeks so Nintendo, which is based in Japan, could assess the U.S.\u2019s new tariff policies. \u201cI really hated it because it was a sought-after product, and I wanted to make sure I got one,\u201d said Garcia, adding he was \u201cgetting nervous.\u201dThe new Switch model has an enhanced audio system and a bigger screen, Nintendo said.Controllers magnetically attach to the side of consoles and can be used like a computer mouse, according to the company. To boost performance, Nvidia (NVDA) developed a chip \u201cunlike anything we\u2019ve built before\u201d for Switch 2, the chipmaker\u2019s CEO Jensen Huang said. Nintendo anticipatesselling 15 million Switch 2 consolesbefore its fiscal year ends in March. The company sold 10.8 million of the original model last year. Retailers hope to capture\u2014and capitalize on\u2014the hype. Target wants to be \u201cthe retail destination for all things Nintendo Switch,\u201d Chief Commercial Officer Rick Gomez said on a recent earnings conference call. Best Buy believes the release will bolster business, executives said last week.

        "content": "MongoDB (MDB) lifted its full-year outlook and boosted itsstock buyback program, sending shares of the AI-powered software provider up over 16% in premarket trading on Thursday. The company said its flagship Atlas multi-cloud database subscription offering, which accounts for the lion\u2019s share ofnet sales, recorded revenue growth of 26% in its latest quarter, adding that the firm also registered the highest total net customer additions in six years as enterprises andstartupsseek to modernize existing software and build new AI applications. Heading into MongoDB\u2019s earnings, the stock was 14% lower over the past 12 months but had recovered 42% from their early April low amid a strong rebound in AI software stocks driven bytrade dealoptimism. Below, we break down thetechnicalson MongoDB\u2019s chart and identify post-earnings price levels worth watching out for. MongoDB shares have carved out aninverse head and shoulders-like pattern between March and June, paving the way for a bullish upsidereversal. More recently, the pattern\u2019s right shoulder found support just above the50-day moving average (MA), with therelative strength index (RSI)confirming strengthening price momentum. That momentum could accelerate in Thursday's trading session following the company\u2019s better-than-expected quarterly results. Let\u2019s identify three crucial overhead areas on MongoDB\u2019s chart that could come into focus amid an earnings-driven rally and also point out a vitalsupport levelworth monitoring during futureretracements. Investors should initially watch the $253 area. The shares may encounter overheadresistancein this location near a trendline connecting a range of corresponding trading activity on the chart that preceded the notable early Marchstock gap. This area also closely aligns with the 50%Fibonacci retracement levelwhen applying a grid from the stock's December high to April low. A close above this crucial area could see the shares climb toward $298. This location on the chart may provide selling pressure near severalpeaksthat developed on the chart between September and February. Buying above this area could propel a move to around $355. Investors who haveaccumulated sharesat lower price may seekexit pointsin this region near twin peaks that formed just above the200-day MAin November and December last year. Future retracements in MongoDB shares could see the price revisit lower support at the $212 level.

The jet maker signed a non-prosecution agreement requiring it to invest $455 million in compliance and safety programs and pay out an additional $444.5 million in compensation to the families of those who died in the crashes.Boeing is also responsible for a criminal monetary penalty of $487.2 million, half of which the company paid in 2021, which leaves $243.6 million outstanding. Boeing admitted as part of the agreement to a conspiracy to defraud the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s Aircraft Evaluation Group, which had been evaluating the 737 Max\u2019s flight control system in the years preceding the crashes. Going forward, Boeing agreed to report to an independent compliance consultant, who will in turn report to the government. Granting Boeing a non-prosecution agreement represents a shift in approach by the Department of Justice under the Trump administration. The case had been scheduled to go to trial on June 23, but the DOJ last month reportedlytold relativesof those killed in the Boeing crashes that the government could lose, which would prevent the department from securing additional relief.Lawyers for the families said they plan to formally object to the move.

Arya noted that Nvidia's Blackwell rack-scale systems now account for about 70% of compute sales, with Blackwell Ultra production slated to begin in Q2 alongside Rubin and Feynman on track, underscoring seamless generational transitions and limited ramp costs. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. He highlighted that the recent lifting of AI Diffusion export rules opens a sovereign AI growth vectorsovereign governments and CSPs are expected to build their own foundational models, expanding Nvidia's addressable market beyond hyperscalers. Addressing China-related risks, Arya emphasized that Nvidia considers its China AI exposure fully de-risked after H20 export restrictions, meaning any future sales into the $50 billion China AI TAM would be incremental upside, as current data center forecasts exclude China revenues. Management's guidance around Blackwell execution and the de-risked China outlook alleviates investor concerns that had restrained the stock over the past year. With the GB200 NVL systems fully ramping and strong cloud and enterprise interest, Nvidia's positioning in the ongoing AI wave appears reinforced even as macro uncertainties persist. Investors should care because these developments validate Nvidia's roadmap and could drive upside to consensus estimates, especially if sovereign commitments and China re-entry accelerate. Also, from the chart we can see that consensus estimates point to over a 20% bump from its current price. In fact, the GF value is at $273, which is an enormous upside from current levels.

        "content": "NVIDIA\u2019s NVDA new Blackwell architecture is playing a major role in its latest growth. In the first quarter of fiscal 2026, Blackwell-powered products made up nearly 70% of NVIDIA\u2019s Data Center compute revenues, the segment that jumped 73% year over year to $39 billion. This marks a major shift in the company\u2019s product cycle and points to strong demand for its newest platform. Blackwell is built for heavy AI tasks like training, reasoning models and running AI agents. The company\u2019s GB200 NVL system, based on Blackwell, is already in full use by major players like Microsoft, Google and OpenAI. Beyond big cloud companies, Blackwell is helping build sovereign AI infrastructure in places like Saudi Arabia, Taiwan and the European Union. NVIDIA expects hundreds of AI factories to emerge globally, powered by its chips. NVIDIA claims that its GB200 NVL72 racks can deliver 30 times faster inference than previous systems. This performance boost, along with easy integration using CUDA and NeMo software, is driving adoption. Despite China-related export headwinds, Blackwell\u2019s momentum across sovereign, enterprise and hyperscale customers positions it as NVIDIA\u2019s most impactful platform yet. If adoption keeps pace, Blackwell could drive not just Data Center growth but also lift NVIDIA\u2019s dominance in AI chips to the next level. Two key rivals \u2014Advanced Micro DevicesAMD andIntelINTC \u2014 are attempting to challenge Blackwell\u2019s dominance. Advanced Micro Devices, with its Instinct MI300X platform, is gaining traction in training workloads and offers a competitive performance-per-dollar proposition. The product has witnessed some adoption from hyperscalers, including Microsoft and Meta. The larger memory size of Advanced Micro Devices\u2019 Instinct MI300X platform is a plus, but it lacks the software tools and developer base that NVIDIA offers. Meanwhile, Intel\u2019s Gaudi 3 chips aim to provide a cheaper, open alternative. While promising on paper, Intel\u2019s track record with execution and ecosystem support remains a concern. While both competitors offer promising hardware, NVIDIA\u2019s deep integration of hardware, networking and AI software continues to give Blackwell a significant competitive advantage in the race for AI infrastructure leadership.

        "content": "Memory chip giantMicron Technology(MU2.84%)is back toits cyclical habits. One might think that the artificial intelligence (AI) boom would send Micron's business results and stock returns skyward these days, but the real AI effect isn't quite that simple. As of June 3, Micron's total return stands 33% below last summer's all-time highs. Is this a wide-open buying window or the start of a multiyear downswing? Here's what I think about Micron in June 2025. Micron isn't the only AI-oriented tech stock to take a drastic haircut over the last year. It's almost scary how tightly Micron's stock performance has matched the total returns ofDell Technologies,ASML Holding, andApplied Materialsrecently:  MU Total Return Leveldata byYCharts For the record, AI-centric market darlingNvidiagained 25% over the same period, while theS&P 500(^GSPC-0.53%)market index rose by 14%. So the sinking tide didn't capsize every boat, but it did weigh on mostAI-focused computing hardware expertsnot named Nvidia. Micron did play a part in its own downfall, of course. Sales soared in the first half of 2024, but slowed down more recently. Mind you, many businesses would celebrate a 38% year-over-year revenue jump, like the one Micron reported in March, but that's a significant slowdown from 93% two quarters earlier. Micron's profits followed similar trend lines, which explains why investors lost patience with the stock. And of course, the proposed tariffs may undermine Micron's sales and profits. Nobody knows how the bubbling trade tensions will play out yet. But here's the thing: Micron is well equipped to handle a bit of a slowdown. If anything, the company's in-house chip factories should be able to stockpile memory chips until its largest customers are ready to place large orders again. On top of that, Micron offers market-leading technology. Its next generation of power-efficient data center memory will hit the market in 2026, offering a 60% memory bandwidth increase and even lower power consumption than the current top-of-the-line products. These high-bandwidth chips are a part ofNvidia's latest and greatest AI accelerator cards, so Micron benefits in a very direct way from Nvidia's success. Image source: Getty Images. So Micron remains a top-notch provider of crucial hardware in the generative AI revolution. A short-term slowdown in the order book is not the end of the line. Meanwhile, Micron's stock is trading at just 9.4 times forward earnings estimates. Analysts expect the company's profits to surge in 2025, and for good reason. Yet the market makers out there have not yet accounted for this upcoming bottom-line explosion in their share price calculations. The AI boom makes a real difference to Micron's business prospects, and sales of those low-power but high-performance data center chips should rise from $1 billion last year to \"multibillion dollars\" in 2025. This surge should also be good for Micron's profit margins, since I'm talking about high-end chips with lucrative unit prices. The speed bump simply gives long-term investors another chance to buy Micron shares on the cheap. The long-term returns won't be smooth, but Micron tends to build wealth over its sweeping business cycles. I highly recommend holding a few Micron shares for the long haul.",

        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) shares are in the spotlight as an increasing number of market indicators point to strong growth for the company's chips. The stock has gained about 20% over the past month. Kimberly Forrest from Bokeh Capital talked about the company during a latest program on Schwab Network. She believes Nvidia's chips demand remain strong. \"I think the title if I was back on the sell side writing about this it would be like Porsche except no substitute or there is no substitute.

So the company is firing on all cylinders, everybody wants their product, they're moving forward with good products and it doesn't look like the biggest fear that an NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) shareholder has is that somebody else comes up with a good enough chip that's cheaper.\" A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. \u00a0 With its latest numbers and stock performance, Nvidia was able to prove the skeptics wrong. In its recently reported quarter, Nvidia's data center computer revenue rose 76% year over year, driven by Blackwell GB200. Despite a $4.5 billion inventory charge related to US import restrictions for China, the company expects gross margins to reach the mid-70% range by late this year due to scaling Blackwell production. NVDA bulls believe the company can easily offset losses related to China amid new products and market diversification.\u00a0 Saudi Arabia's Humain plans to buy more than 200,000 AI GPUs from Nvidia, potentially generating $15 billion in sales. The UAE reportedly has an agreement for up to 500,000 GPUs. Even without China\u2019s involvement for now, Nvidia said nearly 100 AI factories are under construction. These factories have hyperscalers deploying 1,000 GB200 NVL72 racks weekly, each with 72,000 Blackwell GPUs. RiverPark Large Growth Fund stated the following regarding NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in itsQ1 2025 investor letter: \u201cNVIDIA Corporation(NASDAQ:NVDA) was our top detractor in the quarter as investors took profits following its extraordinary performance in 2024. Despite reporting strong quarterly results, the stock pulled back amid concerns that AI-related demand may be plateauing near-term and that capital expenditures by hyperscalers could moderate. Additionally, investor anxiety rose following the announcement of sweeping new tariffs, which sparked fears of supply chain disruptions and rising input costs across the semiconductor industry. We continue to believe that NVIDIA remains one of the most strategically important companies in global computing, with best-in class GPUs, a dominant software ecosystem, and expanding opportunities in inference, networking, and edge AI.

        "header": "How GM + Nvidia are changing the face of the automotive industry",
        "content": "General Motors is making significant strides in revolutionizing its manufacturing processes through a new partnership with chipmaker Nvidia. Announced in March, the collaboration aims to harness the power of artificial intelligence to enhance automation, cut costs and improve efficiency across GM\u2019s factories. At the heart of this partnership is Nvidia\u2019s advanced computing technology, which GM is leveraging to build custom AI systems for its manufacturing operations. The automaker is usingNvidia Omniversewith Cosmos to create digital twins of its assembly lines, allowing for virtual testing and simulation of production processes before physical implementation. This is JP Hampstead, co-host with Craig Fuller of theBring\u00a0It\u00a0Home\u00a0podcast. Welcome to the 25th edition of our newsletter, where we go deep into one of the largest-scale tech-industrial partnerships in the automotive industry. \u201cUsing digital twins, we simulate a running production line before it\u2019s constructed, optimizing our planning process and allowing us to scale faster while saving time and money,\u201d explained JP Clausen, GM\u2019s executive VP of global manufacturing and sustainability. \u201cIt also helps our team members identify and solve problems more effectively.\u201d These digital simulations enable GM to test and refine new production processes without disrupting existing vehicle manufacturing, a critical advantage as the company balances production of both traditional combustion engines and electric vehicles. The partnership extends to training robotics platforms for operations such as material handling, transport and precision welding. Through a combination of AI and machine learning, GM has developed systems that can identify potential issues in manufacturing, such as leaks in battery packs, allowing for quick repairs and supporting quality control. The automotive industry, led by companies like GM, remains the largest user of industrial robots in America. According to Brookings Institute data, nearly half of the 233,305 industrial robots in the United States are employed in auto manufacturing. Michigan,\u00a0home\u00a0to GM\u2019s headquarters, accounts for nearly 28,000 robots \u2014 approximately 12% of the nation\u2019s total. Detroit, in particular, stands out as the robot capital of America, with more than three times the number of industrial robots compared to other metropolitan areas. By 2015, the Detroit-Warren-Dearborn area had 15,115 industrial robots in place, or 8.5 per 1,000 workers, a significant increase from 5,753 robots in 2010. This high concentration of automation has contributed to a dramatic shift in GM\u2019s workforce composition over decades. In 1979, GM employed 468,000 American hourly workers, representing 76% of its U.S. workforce. By 2021, that number had dropped to just 45,000 American hourly workers, or 46% of the company\u2019s domestic workforce. GM\u2019s innovation hub, the Global Technical Center in Warren, Michigan, employs approximately 24,000 people with an average annual salary of $120,000. This facility has become central to developing the company\u2019s AI-driven manufacturing technologies. Using both robotics and proprietary AI tools, GM has implemented systems to inspect welds and paint coats, identifying irregularities and anomalies that might affect vehicle quality. This technology not only improves product quality but also enhances workplace safety by automating potentially hazardous tasks. \u201cWe\u2019re using AI and advanced software to help our team minimize ergonomic stressors, enable workplace safety and enhance quality in our manufacturing plants,\u201d notes Clausen. \u201cInvesting in our current and future workforce with better technology helps ensure that our teams have the skills and tools needed as we continue to evolve our manufacturing footprint to meet customer demand.\u201d GM\u2019s automation advancements come at a critical time as the company navigates challenges in electric vehicle production. In October 2023, GM announced delays in the production of electric trucks, including the Chevy Silverado EV and GMC Sierra EV, pushing the start date at its Orion Assembly plant from 2024 to late 2025. The company cited the need to \u201calign its capital investments with electric vehicle demand and implement vehicle engineering improvements to boost profitability\u201d as reasons for the delay. GM\u2019s partnership with Nvidia aims to address these challenges by improving engineering efficiency and manufacturing processes. Engineers collaborate in real time on digital twins of manufacturing robotics using Nvidia\u2019s Omniverse. (Photo: Nvidia) Despite production delays, GM maintains ambitious plans, projecting to have more than 1 million units of EV capacity in North America by the end of 2025 and to convert 50% of its North American assembly capacity to EV production by 2030. While automation raises concerns about job displacement, GM emphasizes that AI is being implemented to enhance, not replace, its workforce. The company describes its approach as \u201cpeople-centric,\u201d using AI to help employees avoid ergonomic stressors and improve workplace safety. \u201cIt\u2019s not about automating everything or building more vehicles faster \u2014 our winning formula is driven by a combination of flexible manufacturing, advanced technology, and a talented workforce,\u201d states Clausen. Nevertheless, GM\u2019s transformation from \u201cautomaker to platform innovator\u201d suggests a continuing shift toward higher-skilled, technology-focused employment. In its presentation to investors titled \u201cFrom Automaker to Platform Innovator,\u201d GM projected that software and new business ventures would grow from $2 billion to $80 billion by 2030, indicating a future in which salaried professionals may increasingly outnumber traditional manufacturing workers. The Nvidia partnership positions GM to remain competitive in an increasingly technology-driven automotive landscape. Jensen Huang, Nvidia\u2019s founder and CEO, emphasized the significance of the collaboration: \u201cThe era of physical AI is here, and together with GM, we\u2019re transforming transportation, from vehicles to the factories where they\u2019re made.\u201d GM plans to build next-generation vehicles on Nvidia DRIVE AGX, based on the Nvidia Blackwell architecture, delivering up to 1,000 trillion operations per second of high-performance compute. This technology will not only power manufacturing but also enhance future advanced driver-assistance systems and in-cabin safety features. As automotive manufacturing continues to advance, GM\u2019s strategic investments in AI and robotics may provide a competitive edge. The company has maintained its position as the U.S. sales leader for three consecutive years through 2024, offering what it describes as \u201cthe broadest portfolio of electric vehicles in the industry,\u201d with plans to expand to a dozen EV models by the end of 2025. \u201cThe era of physical AI is here.\u201d \u2013 Jensen Huang, Nvidia CEO (Image: Fortune Business Insights) GlobalFoundries Announces $16B U.S. Investment to Reshore Essential Chip Manufacturing and Accelerate AI Growth GlobalFoundries (NASDAQ: GFS) (GF), working with the Trump administration and with support from leading technology companies aiming to onshore critical components of their supply chain, has announced plans to invest $16 billion to expand its semiconductor manufacturing and advanced packaging capabilities across its facilities in New York and Vermont. GF\u2019s investment is a strategic response to the explosive growth in artificial intelligence, which is accelerating demand for next-generation semiconductors designed for power efficiency and high-bandwidth performance across data centers, communications infrastructure and AI-enabled devices. Kraft Heinz confirms $3B investment in US manufacturing Kraft Heinz will spend $3 billion on its U.S. manufacturing facilities, the company confirmed to Food Dive. It\u2019s the largest investment in its plants in decades. Pedro Navio, president of Kraft Heinz\u2019s North America operations, told Reuters earlier this month that planned investments could add 3,500 employees to the Lunchables producer\u2019s workforce. Rolls-Royce to invest $24 million in US manufacturing Rolls-Royce has announced a $24 million U.S. investment that will more than double production of backup power generation systems for data centers and create more than 100 new jobs in the U.S. The investment includes a new 250,000ft2 Logistics Operations Centre adjacent to the existing manufacturing facility in Mankato, Minnesota. It will enable Rolls-Royce to increase production capacity for its mtu Series 4000 generator sets, which are in high demand from the rapidly growing data center industry.

        "content": "In an increasingly digital world, the risk of data breaches, hacks, and various other crimes is constantly growing. Thecybersecurityindustry has emerged as the primary defense against cybercrime. It protects businesses, government agencies, and individual customers against threats ranging from malware and phishing attacks to ransomware, cryptocurrency-related thefts, and exploitation of vulnerabilities in new internet-enabled devices. The growth of the cybersecurity industry presents an opportunity for investors, as the number of publicly tradedfirms specializing in cybersecurityhas grown as well. Still, despite strong demand and growth industry wide, the cybersecurity space requires some special considerations and provides a unique set of opportunities and risks for investors. It\u2019s important to know how to approach investing in this industry before jumping in. Cybersecurity is the practice of defending data, devices, and networks from criminal use and unauthorized access, as well as protecting the integrity and security of information. Some of the most common cyberattacks include malware (unwanted files or software that may harm a connected device or otherwise compromise data), social engineering, and phishing attacks that seek to gain unauthorized access to accounts,cryptocurrency thefts, and more. Cybersecurity is essential today because nearly every system across society relies on computers and the internet, introducing vulnerabilities that are potentially exploitable by attackers at countless points. The different subfields of cybersecurity include: The global cybersecurity market is valued at roughly $215 billion in 2025 and is expected to more than triple to $697 billion in the next 10 years. Sustained demand for hardware, software, and cybersecurity services should drive a compound annual growth rate of 11.3% during that time. Investors considering a way to capitalize on the growing cybersecurity industry should first consider theirrisk tolerancerelative to the space. Cybersecurity firms are in demand, but the industry is populated by both established companies and smaller, much riskier plays. Further, even the most stalwart cybersecurity firms can experience unanticipated turbulence. For example, in July 2024, an update to the software of industry leader CrowdStrike (\u200b\u200bCRWD) caused aglobal tech disruption, causing a temporary plunge in share price. Besides risk, investors should also consider how and whether cybersecurity companies can match their individualinvestment goals. Many of these firms are poised for growth, but they may also be less likely to appeal to dividend investors. The two primary ways for retail investors to gain exposure to the cybersecurity industry are through individual stocks and cybersecurity-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs). 1. Individual Stocks For stocks, investors must keep in mind the goals of individual companies and that different firms attempt to take on various aspects of the work of the cybersecurity industry. Endpoint providers, for example, aim to protect the perimeter of a network through secure entry points, while network security vendors might offer services aimed at protecting individual users and their data and devices. Still other companies integrate cybersecurity strategies into other national defense and aerospace applications, providing a natural crossover between industries. When evaluating individual stocks, consider fundamental and technical metrics before entering a position. Investors might also see whether a particular company has flashing growth metrics, such as the price-to-sales ratio, that may indicate its potential to grow. Look at recentearnings reportsand trends in revenue, earnings per share (EPS), customer base, and more. It\u2019s also essential to see how companies adapt to changing threats\u2014does a firm have the capacity to introduce new security tools? Or is it more reliant on a popular but static offering that may lose effectiveness over time? Once an investor has identified potential targets among individual cybersecurity stocks, purchasing them through a traditional or online broker is likely the next step. Keep in mind that these securities can be part of a larger,diversified portfolio, or investors can also provide modest diversification across the cybersecurity space by targeting different types of companies as detailed above. 2. ETFs For many investors, the easiest way to gain broad access to cybersecurity firms is through a related ETF, such as the First Trust NASDAQ Cybersecurity ETF (CIBR). Like other ETFs,cybersecurity fundsinclude a basket of stocks within this space, providing automatic diversification and taking the burden of portfolio management out of the hands of the individual investor. On the other hand, ETFs do charge a modest fee in the form of anexpense ratio. Further, some funds may include cybersecurity stocks alongside a broader range of other IT or tech-focused companies, so investors will need to decide if they want to exclusively focus on cybersecurity firms or if they are comfortable with a broader view. ETF shares can be traded through brokerages in the same way as individual stocks. Some benefits of investing in cybersecurity include the strong demand for companies in this space and the widespread applicability of cybersecurity products and technologies. Because nearly every company and organization is online, the need for cybersecurity solutions and services spans all sectors and industries. Cybersecurity businesses are poised for major growth in the coming years, and both established and up-and-coming firms could benefit. On the other hand, some of the risks of cybersecurity as an investment area include the ever-evolving nature of threats and limited resources among companies for investment in the space. As malicious actors continue to develop new ways to engage in digital attacks, even well-established companies face new business risks that may leave them unprepared to meet customer needs. For investors, this means the risk of instability across the industry. Similarly, though companies generally increase the amount they spend on cybersecurity, many businesses still have limited resources to give to this space, meaning competition among providers is intense and often unpredictable. Yes, cybersecurity is a fast-growing industry. Some analyses expect the size of the global cybersecurity business to more than triple to nearly $700 billion by 2035. Cybersecurity stocks are attractive investments because they provide services that are in demand across virtually all sectors and industries. Many of these companies have exceptional growth potential. Analysts expect that the demand for cybersecurity will continue to grow for the foreseeable future. This makes the industry a strong choice for investors planning for the long term. However, as the CrowdStrike shutdown of summer 2024 shows, even the most established companies in the space can face unanticipated challenges that can disrupt their performance. Cybersecurity companies provide hardware, software, and services to prevent digital attacks, secure information, and protect companies, individual users, and other organizations. The industry is rapidly growing and is expected to triple in size in the next decade. Two of the most popular ways for investors to gain exposure to the cybersecurity industry are individual stocks and related ETFs. In both cases, investors need to stay informed about news and developments in the space, particularly given that cyberthreats are constantly evolving, and to seek out professional investing advice when needed.",

        "content": "Investing.com -- Recently, Huawei Technologies has emerged as NVIDIA Corporation\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) most high-profile rival in the race to power artificial intelligence development in China. But according to a report from The Information, the Chinese tech giant is struggling to gain traction with major domestic customers despite rising interest in homegrown solutions. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has publicly warned of Huawei\u2019s growing capabilities and the broader acceleration of China\u2019s chip development efforts due to U.S. export restrictions. Yet ByteDance,Alibaba(NYSE:BABA), andTencent Holdings Ltd(F:NNND) ADR (OTC:TCEHY), three of China\u2019s AI leaders, have yet to place significant orders for Huawei\u2019s Ascend chips, even as supplies of Nvidia\u2019s products tighten under U.S. trade controls. Multiple employees across leading firms told The Information that Huawei is \"having a hard time convincing some of the biggest tech companies in China to use its chips.\" Engineers and executives at Chinese firms have voiced concerns over performance shortcomings with Huawei\u2019s hardware, as well as fear of violating American trade laws. Tests by firms such as ByteDance and Alibaba revealed issues with overheating in Huawei\u2019s Ascend 910C chip and limitations in its software stack, Cann, compared with Nvidia\u2019s industry-standard Cuda platform. Transitioning from Nvidia to Huawei would also involve a high switching cost, requiring a redesign of data center infrastructure, software, and engineering workflows. If the firms are to switch over to Huawei chips en masse, executives say that the company must adapt to its platform. Some developers, like DeepSeek, may play a pivotal role in shaping Huawei\u2019s trajectory as others watch closely to see whether an ecosystem can form around its chips. \u201cIf DeepSeek is willing to adopt Huawei\u2019s chips and software in AI training extensively, it will attract many open-source developers to build their models on Huawei\u2019s ecosystem. But at the moment, that isn\u2019t the case,\u201d said Bernstein semiconductor analyst Qingyuan Lin, cited by The Information. Huawei\u2019s new AI compute system, CloudMatrix 384, attempts to compensate for individual chip performance by linking as many as 384 Ascend processors together. But the system faces technical roadblocks, including high power consumption and lack of native support for FP8, a low-precision number format essential to cutting-edge AI training. A further complication is geopolitical: a recent U.S. Department of Commerce warning puts companies using Huawei\u2019s advanced AI chips at risk of \u201csubstantial criminal and administrative penalties.\u201d This has already led at least one Chinese data center firm to cancel a tentative order for Huawei hardware. Despite these obstacles, Huawei has secured meaningful sales to state-owned enterprises and local governments. But for now, top-tier Chinese tech firms show no sign of abandoning Nvidia, whose products still dominate high-performance AI systems, even as the regulatory pressure tightens on both sides of the Pacific.

        "content": "Shares of Costco Wholesale (COST) fell Thursday after the company turned in monthly sales growth figures for May that came in below April's year-over-year figures. Costco's stock was recently down more than 3%. The company after yesterday's closing bell said its sales in May grew 6.8% year-over-year to $20.97 billion, slightly slower than the 7% that it saw in April compared to April 2024. The warehouse retailer's comparable store sales rose 4.1% in the U.S., 4.3% for the total company, and online sales grew 11.6% in May. The 5.5% comparable sales increase in the U.S., when excluding the impact of gas prices and foreign exchange rates, came in below the 6.4% analyst consensus, JPMorgan analysts wrote. The analysts wrote that Costco's sales results are in line with some other retailers that mentioned in recent earnings reports that May sales were weaker than April or March, largely due to weather\u2014including a cooler-than-normal Memorial Day weekend in parts of the country. Costco said it doesn't typically cite weather as a factor unless there is an extreme weather event, per the analysts. Any big purchases that consumers made ahead of schedule because of fears that tariffs would raise prices likely peaked in March and April, as executives said in last week's earnings call that they were seeing few tariff-motivated purchases at this point, according to the JPM analysts. The analysts said Costco's comparable sales growth could be pressured in the next few months as Costco laps thepopular sales of its gold bars, which frequentlysold out quicklywhen they were available. The retailer narrowly beatestimatesin its fiscalthird-quarter report, as other analysts have said Costco is well-positioned to navigate the tariff environment. Costco shares are up more than 10% this year, but remain below record levels set in February. This article has been updated since it was first published to reflect new share-price information.",

        "content": "Shares of artificial intelligence (AI) cloud service providerNebius Group(NBIS17.17%)are surging today. The stock jumped after one independent equity research firm began coverage on the stock with a very bullish outlook. Nebius stock was trading higher by 19.5% as of 11:05 a.m. ET. Image source: Getty Images. London-based Arete Research analyst Andrew Beale began coverage of the stock with a \"buy\" rating and a price target that seems to have taken investors by surprise. Reports say Beale set $84 as his price target, which represents a 113% increase over Wednesday's closing price. The analyst sees that significant upside after the Netherlands-based Nebius recently reported first-quarter revenue growth of 385%. That was off a low base versus last year, but the company sees continued expansion at an accelerated rate. Beale's optimism stems from the nearly 700% increase in Nebius' annualizedrevenue run rate. Management expects to at least triple that annualized level of revenue by the fourth quarter of this year. ItsAI cloud capabilitiesare in high demand, and Nebius reports a strong $1.44 billion cash position as of March 31. That cash will be needed for the continued investment in cloud infrastructure to continue to scale the business. Nebius also announced a $1 billion capital raise on June 2 from thesale of convertible notes. Nebius also has a partnership with AI leaderNvidia, offering the new Blackwell Ultra AI factory platform to businesses looking \"to build the next generation of agentic, reasoning, and physical AI.\" Investors still need to consider the risks. In addition to its capital spending needs, Nebius seeks to achieve a goal of positive adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) later this year. That's one key metric investors should continue to monitor. That would instill more confidence in the stock and the company's ability to continue to achieve its high growth trajectory.",

        "content": "NVIDIAhas gained attention with its recent expansion in AI startups and introduction of new programming languages for the automotive market, coinciding with a 28% share price increase in the last quarter. These developments align with the broader market's modest upward trend, as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq both marked winning streaks, lifted by renewed economic optimism and progress in trade talks with China. NVIDIA's collaboration with Accenture, AdaCore, and various industry leaders adds weight to its momentum, complementing its focus on AI and autonomous technology, which have remained key drivers of interest amid robust market conditions. We've spotted 1 possible red flag for NVIDIA you should be aware of. We've found 19 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free. The recent developments at NVIDIA, particularly its expansion into AI startups and new programming languages for the automotive market, could significantly influence its long-term growth narrative. The partnerships with industry giants Toyota and Uber aim to cement NVIDIA's presence in the autonomous vehicles sector, potentially boosting revenue streams and market share. These collaborations align with NVIDIA's focus on AI and autonomous technology, potentially enhancing its data center and AI workloads, which in turn might improve earnings and margin potential. Analysts have projected NVIDIA's earnings to grow substantially, assuming it capitalizes on these burgeoning opportunities. However, regulatory challenges and export controls could impact these forecasts, as uncertainty remains a persistent risk. Over the past five years, NVIDIA's total return, including share price appreciation and dividends, has been very large, reflecting significant long-term value creation. In comparison to its one-year performance, NVIDIA surpassed the US Semiconductor industry, which posted a 10.3% gain, suggesting strong relative performance. This longer-term gain is a testament to NVIDIA's rapid growth trajectory, bolstered by innovation and strategic sector expansions. Despite the impressive gains, NVIDIA's current share price of US$113.54 is significantly lower than the consensus analyst price target of US$163.12, indicating potential room for growth. As the company continues to navigate AI and automotive sectors, these market moves can be pivotal in driving future revenue and earnings. Investors may need to assess if the growth potential justifies the price target, considering the associated risks and market dynamics. The ongoing scaling of the Blackwell architecture and its implications for operational efficiency and cost management will be central to NVIDIA meeting or exceeding analyst expectations.

        "content": "Shares ofNavitas Semiconductor(NVTS-10.91%)rocketed 164.2% in May, according to data fromS&P Global Market Intelligence. Entering the month, Navitas has been a small designer of gallium nitride (GaN) and silicon carbide (SiC) chip designs. These niche chips had primarily targeted electric vehicles and electrified infrastructure. But given the recent downturns in these markets, Navitas had seen its revenue go into reverse and its bottom line continuing to lose money. But in mid-May,Nvidianamed Navitas as a key partner for Nvidia's upcoming Kyber data center infrastructure, which will be a new architecture to support Rubin-based sever racks beginning in 2027. While other power chip providers were also named, the fact that Navitas was so small, at just $350 million or somarket capat the time of the announcement, caused a massive rally in the stock. Navitas then used the opportunity to sell stock and bolster its balance sheet, extending its runway, likely until the 2027 time frame. As Nvidia explained in a May 20 blog post, the current 54 V DC power distribution systems in today's data centers will push up against their physical limits as AI server racks go to needing 200 kilowatts to power next-generation AI chips. To counter this, Nvidia is developing a ground-up redesign of data centers to an 800 V HVDC power architecture. Nvidia also noted that it was collaborating with a number of power chip and infrastructure companies early on as it develops the new data center power infrastructure, which Nvidia plans to unveil in 2027 for its upcoming Rubin-based systems. The following day, Navitas published its own blog post explaining how the new 800 V architecture will use both Navitas' SiC chips in the power room of data centers, which convert AC grid power to DC power for the data center, and then GaN-based power converters at the server rack level. The day of the blogs, May 21, Navitas rocketed 150% higher, before retreating. But then the following week, Navitas disclosed it had exhausted its $50 million equity at-the-market sales facility, and that it hadfiled for a new $50 million facility. Normally, when a company notes it has and willdilute shareholders, the stock goes down. But since Navitas' stock had gone up so much, investors viewed the capital raise as a positive, in that it fortified Navitas' balance sheet to bridge more of the time gap between now and 2027. Image source: Getty Images. While the prospect of a small company partnering up with Nvidia is highly tantalizing, there weren't any financial terms disclosed in the announcements. That makes sense, as the platform isn't even fully developed yet, and revenues from the venture aren't likely to come before 2027. So it's hard to say right now if Navitas has moved too far, too fast. Still, last month's cash raise will bolster Navitas' balance sheet, giving it more time to build out its platform in anticipation of the 2027 Kyber rollout.",

The company reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.42 on revenue that jumped 24% year-over-year to $1.13 billion. Analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha had expected $0.52 and $1.09 billion, respectively. In Thursday's earnings call, CFO Jim Moylan said the company's adjusted operating expense of $369 million was \"higher than expected, driven entirely by higher incentive compensation, associated with very strong order performance in the quarter\u00a0and our overall financial performance in the first half of the year,\" per a transcript provided by AlphaSense. Moylan said the company expects tariffs to create a headwind of about $10 million per quarter going forward, most of which Ciena said it expects to be able to mitigate. The CFO said that Ciena projects $1.13 billion to $1.21 billion in fiscal third-quarter revenue, above the $1.1 billion consensus. However, the company's adjusted operating expense is forecast at $370 million to $375 million, well above the $356.0 million that analysts expect, which Moylan said is again due to the higher incentive compensation.

        "content": "NVIDIA CorporationNVDA recently achieved a milestone, following double-digit revenue growth in the fiscal 2026 first quarter and a business boom. Let\u2019s explore this achievement and consider the NVDA stock\u2019s potential for investment. On Tuesday, NVIDIA surpassedMicrosoft CorporationMSFT to regain the title of the world\u2019s most valuable company. NVIDIA\u2019s shares continued to rally on Wednesday, with the Jensen Huang-led company\u2019s market capitalization currently at $3.461 trillion. NVIDIA stock rose by over 50% from its low in April, leading to a market capitalization increase of over $1 trillion as investors showed renewed confidence. NVIDIA\u2019s shares have experienced periods of volatility this year due to investor concerns about the sustainability of artificial intelligence (AI) demand and the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs. However, better-than-expected first-quarter revenues, despite losing billions in sales due to the U.S. export ban on China, powered NVIDIA\u2019s shares. For the quarter, NVIDIA posted revenues of $44.1 billion, exceeding analysts\u2019 expectations of $43.3 billion and significantly more than $26 billion in the same period last year. NVIDIA successfully overcame supply-chain bottlenecks to deliver its cutting-edge Blackwell AI servers to big cloud customers, including Microsoft. NVIDIA\u2019s primary contract chip manufacturer,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company LimitedTSM, or TSMC, confirmed strong AI chip demand, whileCoreWeave, Inc.\u2019s CRWV new data center will be filled with NVIDIA\u2019s chips. All these developments also helped NVIDIA\u2019s shares trade in positive territory for the year, up 5.4% year to date. To enhance AI computing capabilities, cloud computing companiesAlphabet Inc.GOOGL andAmazon.com, Inc. AMZN, to name a few, are purchasing graphics processing units (GPUs), where NVIDIA has more than a 90% market share, according to IoT Analytics. This wide moat should continue to bolster growth. Moreover, the increase in popularity of the CUDA software platform among developers and the growing demand for the Blackwell chips due to their faster AI interface are expected to boost NVIDIA\u2019s growth. At the same time, NVIDIA stands to benefit from the AI revolution in autonomous robots and self-driving cars. Amazon employs NVIDIA\u2019s Isaac to train warehouse robots, andTesla, Inc.TSLA relies on NVIDIA\u2019s technology for self-driving cars. NVIDIA\u2019s increasing value, rise in first-quarter revenues, growing AI data center spending, demand for its latest chip and GPU, and potential growth in automotive revenues should encourage stakeholders to stay invested in NVDA stock. Additionally, keeping NVDA stock due to its strong fundamentals makes sense as the company\u2019s net profit margin of 55.7% outperformed the Semiconductor - General industry\u2019s 49.5%. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research However, the U.S. government has restricted NVIDIA from selling its H20 chips to the Chinese market, which could impact the company\u2019s revenue growth vis-\u00e0-vis its stock performance in the future. Therefore, new entrants should wait and watch for any progress in this area before making a bet on NVDA stock. For now, NVIDIA has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

        "content": "Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) Q1 results landed like a bombshell last week, shattering expectations with $44.1 billion in revenue, marking a 69% surge year-over-year, driven by relentless demand for itsAIand data center chips. From fueling Microsoft\u2019s (MSFT) AI workloads to posting record-breaking gaming sales, NVIDIA\u2019s dominance is staggering. Easily unpack a company's performancewith TipRanks' new KPI Datafor smart investment decisions Receive undervalued, market resilient stocks right to your inboxwith TipRanks' Smart Value Newsletter Even with a $4.5 billion hit from U.S. export restrictions on its China-bound H20 chips, the company didn\u2019t waver, posting numbers that still left Wall Street stunned. And yet, NVDA stock lingers near last year\u2019s levels, even as profits soar, making it a compelling bet for market-beating returns. NVIDIA\u2019s data center business has been the beating heart of its success, raking in $39.1 billion in Q1, up 73% from last year. NVIDIA is literally crafting the infrastructure for the AI era. On the earnings call, CEO Jensen Huang described the Blackwell NVL72 AI supercomputer as a \u201cthinking machine\u201d now in full production, with Microsoft deploying tens of thousands of Blackwell GPUs to process 100 trillion AI tokens. I mean, that\u2019s the kind of scale that makes competitors sweat. From cloud giants like Amazon Web Services (AMZN) to sovereign AI projects in Saudi Arabia, NVIDIA\u2019s chips are the backbone of a global AI race. The wins keep piling up. Strategic moves, such as partnering with HUMAIN to build AI factories in Saudi Arabia, demonstrate NVIDIA\u2019s ambition to integrate its technology into every corner of the globe. Huang\u2019s vision of AI as critical infrastructure (like roads or power grids) does not exist in the realm of hype but is instead more like a blueprint for the future. With data center revenue making up 89% of Q1\u2019s haul, NVIDIA\u2019s grip on AI\u2019s plumbing is only getting stronger. While AI steals the spotlight, NVIDIA\u2019s gaming and networking segments are quietly flexing their muscles. Gaming revenue hit a record $3.8 billion, up 42% year-over-year, thanks to the GeForce RTX 50 series. And despite reports of some hardware glitches, NVIDIA\u2019s quick response with replacements kept gamers loyal, cementing its brand as the gold standard for high-performance graphics. Networking is another unsung hero, with Q1 revenue soaring 64% quarter-over-quarter to $5 billion. NVIDIA\u2019s Spectrum-X Ethernet solutions are becoming the go-to for data centers handling massive AI workloads. Think of it as building the highways for AI\u2019s data deluge. The company\u2019s ability to scale these complementary businesses demonstrates that it\u2019s not just a chipmaker, but a full-stack powerhouse with multiple growth engines firing simultaneously. You\u2019d expect a $4.5 billion charge from U.S. export restrictions on NVIDIA\u2019s H20 chip for China to throw a wrench in the works, but NVIDIA barely flinched. The company still beat Wall Street\u2019s $43.3 billion revenue forecast, even with a $2.5 billion sales loss in China. CFO Colette Kress noted on the call that customer demand remains \u201cfirm,\u201d and NVIDIA\u2019s already exploring compliant chip designs to tap China\u2019s $50 billion AI market. Without the H2O hit, adjusted gross margins would have reached 71.3%, proving the core business remains a profit juggernaut. This resilience is almost surreal. Imagine taking a multi-billion-dollar punch and still delivering a knockout quarter. Huang\u2019s comments about China as a \u201cspringboard to global success\u201d signal that NVIDIA is not backing down, with active lobbying for export licenses to regain its footing. The fact that growth still smashed expectations despite this setback made NVIDIA\u2019s Q1 feel like a masterclass in navigating adversity. Despite NVIDIA\u2019sadjusted EPS soaring quarter after quarter (coming in at $0.81 in Q1, up from $0.61 a year ago), the stock hasn\u2019t maintained the same pace over the past year, resulting in valuation multiple compression. At 34x this fiscal year\u2019s expected EPS, I view the stock as quite attractively priced. With consensus estimates forecasting EPS growth of 43% this year and 34% next, driven by AI and data center tailwinds, today\u2019s multiple doesn\u2019t really feel rich. I believe these trends could persist for years, given NVIDIA\u2019s dominance in AI infrastructure (think robotics, autonomous vehicles, and enterprise AI), which could power substantial gains from current share prices. Despite trading near its highs, Wall Street remains extremely bullish on NVDA stock. NVIDIA features a Strong Buy consensus rating, with 36 analysts currently bullish, four neutral, and just one bearish.NVDA\u2019s average stock price target of $173.19indicates significant upside potential of nearly 23% over the next twelve months. NVIDIA\u2019s Q1 report was nothing short of explosive, showcasing dominance across AI, gaming, networking, and more, all while mitigating headwinds such as the China export restrictions. Trading at just 34x forward earnings, the stock appears to be a steal, given its expected 43% EPS growth this year and the powerful, long-term momentum behind AI. NVIDIA isn\u2019t just part of the tech revolution; it\u2019s leading it, setting the standard for the entire industry. Investors dragging their feet risk missing out on what could be a once-in-a-generation opportunity to ride a true market giant to new heights. Disclaimer & DisclosureReport an Issue",

        "content": "There's no denying that the emergence ofgenerative artificial intelligence (AI)was the spark that liftedNvidia(NVDA-1.44%)stock to new heights. In recent months, however, the future has been less certain. Concerns about how AI models will evolve and whether they will need the latest and greatest chips sent some investors to the sidelines. In fact, earlier this year, Nvidia stock plunged 37% on fears the company's best days were behind it. It turns out the sky isn't falling after all. Nvidia has delivered two successive quarters of high-double-digit revenue growth, as demand for AI remains robust. Indeed, the stock is within striking distance of a new all-time high after notching gains of 50% over the past two months. Let's take a step back and review the opportunity, Nvidia's place in the AI ecosystem, and whether it's too late to buy the stock. Image source: Getty Images. Nvidia's original claim to fame is developing the graphics processing units (GPUs) that generate lifelike images in video games. However, it was the adapting of that technology to train and run AI systems that catapulted the chipmaker to new heights. The popular narrative is that its rivals are on the verge of a better solution, but thus far anyway, none has been forthcoming. The company established a beachhead in AI as early as 2013, giving Nvidia more than a decade-long head start on the competition. After developing processors focused on machine learning -- an earlier branch of AI -- Nvidia quickly became the gold standard, controlling as much as 95% of the market, according to CB Insights (via BBC News). That existing expertise gave Nvidia the advantage in the data center GPU space, where it currently controls an estimated 92% of the market, according to IoT Analytics. Thebuildout of data centersto meet the growing demand of AI continues, which bodes well for Nvidia. While Nvidia's growth has inevitably slowed from the triple-digit pace it managed last year, it still runs circles around the competition. For its fiscal 2026 first quarter (ended April 27), the company generated record revenue of $44.1 billion, which surged 69% year over year. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.81 climbed 33% -- but that was after a $4.5 billion hit related to export controls for H20 chips originally destined for China. If not for that one-time charge, EPS would have grown 57%. Management expects the company's robust growth to continue. For its fiscal 2026 second quarter, Nvidia is guiding for record revenue of $45 billion, which would represent growth of 50%. This helps illustrate that despite tough triple-digit comps, Nvidia continues to grow at a remarkable pace. The stock's rebound over the past few months has come with a commensurate increase in its valuation, which begs the question: Has Nvidia stock gotten too expensive? Investors might be surprised to learn that simply isn't the case. Nvidia stock is selling for roughly 33 times forward earnings (as of this writing), which is an attractive valuation for a company that's expected to grow its profits by 50% in the coming quarter. Furthermore, when measured using theprice/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG ratio), Nvidia has a multiple of 0.56, when any number less than 1 is the standard for an undervalued stock. Despite the rapid run over the past two years, it's important to remember it's still early days for the adoption of generative AI. These groundbreaking systems have only been around for a little more than two years, and many believe the adoption cycle will continue for much of the next decade. Estimates vary wildly regarding the potential size of the AI market but they can still give context regarding the size of the opportunity. The generative AI market could be worth between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion annually in the coming years, according to global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company. Given Nvidia's market-leading position, deeply entrenched technology, the magnitude of the opportunity, and its attractive valuation, I would argue it isn't too late to buy Nvidia stock. These aren't empty words: I added to my Nvidia position as recently as April.",

        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA,Financials) director Mark Stevens sold more than 1 million shares this week,bringing in nearly $150 millionfrom two transactions on Monday and Tuesday, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. Those sales are part of a broader plan disclosed Monday to sell up to 4 million Nvidia sharesworth about $550 million at the timeunder a proposed 10b5-1 program. Analysts have noted that Stevens's disposals represent the largest individual trade outside of Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang's planned sales. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. Revenue rose to $44.1 billion in the fiscal first quarter, up 69 percent from a year earlier and topping the $41.8 billion consensus forecast, according to Nvidia's earnings release. The company expects current-period revenue of about $45 billion, which runs through July. Nvidia shares have rallied nearly 50 percent since hitting a year-to-date low on April 4, the day after President Donald Trump announced new tariff measures. The rebound reflects renewed confidence in sustained demand for AI chips in data centers. Stevens's sales came from shares held by Third Millennium Trust, of which he and his wife serve as trustees. He first registered to sell 3 million shares on a Form 144 filing in September of last year but ultimately sold less than 500,000 shares over a series of transactions. His net worth stands at $9.8 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, the majority of which comes from his Nvidia holdings. Nvidia did not comment on the sale, and Stevens could not be reached for comment. Other insiders have also put shares on the block. Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang adopted a new 10b5-1 plan on March 20 to sell 6 million shares by year-end, representing about $850 million at current prices. Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress initiated a plan to sell 500,000 sharesvalued at more than $70 million as of Wednesdayby March 24, 2026. Board member Brooke Seawell adopted a plan in March to sell roughly 1.1 million shares. Insider share sales at Nvidia exceeded $2 billion last year, but 2025 had seen only about $30 million before Stevens's $150 million sale, according to Washington Service data. The sales coincide with Nvidia's strong first-quarter results and bullish forward guidance. Investors will watch for potential signs of slowing enterprise AI spending as trade policies evolve. Analysts also note that continued insider selling could temper upside, even as robust demand for GPUs remains. Upcoming catalysts include Nvidia's mid-year developer conference and any new commentary on AI chip supply constraints in China. This article first appeared onGuruFocus.",

        "content": "Five Below\u2019s performance is no longer fueled by fads like Squishmellow or fidget spinners. Its broadening appeal has made UBS one of the retailer's biggest Wall Street backers.

The analysts\u2019 new price target is 25% above the roughly $128 average price target among analysts polled by Visible Alpha and the highest tracked by the service. UBS\u2019 target implies roughly 32% appreciation from Wednesday's close.

Executives said on the conference call that Five Below plans to adjust prices on 15% of products and keep 80% of items in stores priced at $5 or less. The retailer estimates full-year comparable sales will come in 3% to 5% above last year.UBS thinks higher prices won\u2019t deter as many customers as expected, and that Five Below may grow more competitive, pricing-wise, in the era of tariffs. UBS said the 6.2% year-over-year bump in transactions last quarter stands out. \u201cThe only other retailers that generated this type of transaction increase recently have been Costco (COST) and Sprouts\u201d the note said, referencing the grocery chain, Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM).

        "content": "For those who have been following Palantir Technologies (PLTR) for a while, it\u2019s clear that this isn\u2019t a stock that plays by the usual rules. Traditional valuation metrics barely scratch the surface of what\u2019s really going on. This company is riding theAIwave like no other in the software market, dominating not just the enterprise space but the government sector too. Investors are either all in or scratching their heads, wondering if it\u2019s just hype. Easily unpack a company's performancewith TipRanks' new KPI Datafor smart investment decisions Receive undervalued, market resilient stocks right to your inboxwith TipRanks' Smart Value Newsletter Unlike typical software plays, Palantir\u2019s massive backlog of multi-year contracts and margins that would make most tech giants jealous make it a force that\u2019s hard to ignore. But there\u2019s always a catch: with a price tag that essentially prices in perfection, there is no room for execution mistakes or a hype cool-off, leaving Wall Street analysts split between cautious skepticism and outright optimism. Ultimately, I believe Palantir is a can\u2019t-miss AI disruptor that deserves a premium valuation and a bullish rating. To lay out this case, this article breaks down the numbers, the buzz, and the very human debate that keeps this stock one of the most talked-about\u2014and most polarizing\u2014in the market. Several metrics highlight the phenomenal business fundamentals behind Palantir\u2019s trajectory so far. However, one of the best ways to understand the solidity of Palantir\u2019s growth story, especially for the long term, is by examining its Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO). This number shows the future contracted revenue locked into its multi-year agreements. As of Q1 2025, Palantir reported total RPO of $1.9 billion\u2014almost half of the mid-term consensus forecast for annual revenue of $3.9 billion. This backlog coverage demonstrates the strong visibility and durability of the contracts Palantir is closing, providing the company with reliable long-term demand. Unlike businesses with primarily transactional revenues, Palantir\u2019s multi-year commitments offer a stable foundation that smooths out top-line swings and supports steady growth\u2014a pattern that\u2019s held steady for the past couple of years. Another key sign of Palantir\u2019s growth is thebig jump in billings, which rose from $625 million in Q1 2024 to $925 million in Q1 2025\u2014a solid 48% increase. When billings outpace recognized revenue, it usually means the backlog is growing, which ties directly to the strong RPO figure, both reflecting contract wins and renewals that will generate revenue in future quarters. This blend of immediate revenue and durable multi-year customer relationships is a great sign. Together, these factors enable Palantir to forecast its revenue with a clarity not often seen in hybrid software-service companies, as the company\u2019s model isn\u2019t pure SaaS but rather includes deep, customized services through platforms like Apollo and Gotham. Arguably, a big part of what might justify Palantir\u2019s steep 227x forward earnings multiple is the strength of its RPO. The market has strong confidence in Palantir\u2019s ability to consistently convert this backlog into recognized revenue and sustain healthy billings growth. Once Palantir\u2019s software becomes deeply embedded in a client\u2019s operations, especially in governments and large enterprises, it\u2019s both costly and difficult to replace. Beyond that, Palantir has built a unique competitive moat by combining advanced data analytics software with tailored services. This blend is tough for typical SaaS competitors to match, particularly in sensitive sectors like defense, intelligence, and critical infrastructure. The icing on the cake is that Palantir has managed to grow margins alongside revenue at an impressive pace. The Rule of 40 metric highlights this: software companies are considered healthy when their revenue growth plus profitability margins total at least 40%. Palantircrushed this in Q1 2025,posting 39% year-over-year revenue growth and a 44% adjusted operating margin\u2014a combined 83%, after averaging 67% in fiscal 2024. Simply put, Palantir not only exceeds the Rule of 40 but also delivers a rare combo of fast growth and strong margins\u2014something no other large-cap software company currently matches. Despite the countless bearish arguments about Palantir\u2019s high valuation multiples, much of my bullishness comes frominsights by Wedbush analyst Dan Ives. As a Palantir perma-bull, Ives sees the company as a \u201cgenerational opportunity\u201d ready to capitalize on the massive AI revolution, with $2 trillion in software spending expected over the next three years. He believes Palantir is leading the pack in AI adoption across both commercial and government sectors. Given this untapped potential, avoiding Palantir at this stage could mean missing out on one of the most transformational tech stories of the last 20 years. Back in August 2024, when Palantir was trading around $30 per share, critics called it expensive. So, of course, bears will say it\u2019s costly at $130, too. But if investors had avoided transformational tech stocks over the past two decades simply because they looked pricey, they\u2019d have missed out big time. Just like Nvidia (NVDA), before it became a giant in the AI space, it traded at sky-high P/E multiples in 2023, sometimes close to or above 200x. Palantir is still in its early stage, centered on disruptive potential and future growth, far from any plateau. And with the AI revolution driving Nvidia\u2019s story, few today argue that its valuations are irrational or unlikely to be sustained\u2014something many still question about Palantir. Wall Street leans more toward skepticism than optimism when it comes to Palantir\u2019s stock. Among the 18 analysts covering PLTR over the past three months, only three recommend buying, 11 remain neutral, and the other four suggest selling.PLTR\u2019s average 12-month price target stands at $100.13, implying a potential downside of approximately 25% from the current share price. Trying to value Palantir through traditional metrics hasn\u2019t yielded much clarity in recent years. In my view, that\u2019s because Palantir isn\u2019t operating on a traditional trajectory. When a company is positioned at the heart of a technological revolution, like AI, and is executing at a high level across both commercial and government verticals, as Palantir is, investor appetite can easily eclipse conventional valuation logic. To skeptics and value purists, that may sound like an excuse to overlook fundamentals. But so far, Palantir continues to consistently beat expectations, quarter after quarter. And in a market where momentum often drives sentiment, that kind of consistent outperformance matters. With a growing backlog, strong margins, and a competitive moat that\u2019s only deepening, there\u2019s little sign that the company\u2019s momentum is slowing anytime soon.

The significantly larger 7.9-inch display is much easier on the eyes \u2014 a blessing for the eyesight of anyone who\u2019s grown up alongside Nintendo\u2019s gadgets \u2014 and has a sharper 1080p resolution. It\u2019s also far more fluid than the screen on the original version; this model supports a maximum refresh rate of 120Hz, which makes Mario Kart World feel all the more chaotic (in a fun way). These upgrades help offset the fact that the Switch 2 uses an LCD display instead of a punchier OLED panel. The upsized screen means you\u2019re also getting bigger Joy-Con controllers, which makes handheld mode a far more ergonomic experience. The buttons are also larger than before. Everything about the Switch 2 feels less cramped. One of the best changes Nintendo made relates to how the Joy-Cons connect to the console: They now attach magnetically instead of sliding down onto the hardware with a rail mechanism. Magnets inside the console firmly latch onto steel buttons on each Joy-Con. The hold is strong without any of the flimsy wobbling that some users complained about on the original Switch. Disconnecting the Joy-Cons is as simple as pressing the release button on the back of each one. Nintendo\u2019s thoughtful improvements continue elsewhere: The Switch 2 has a second USB-C port, which can be used for accessories (or just more flexibility in how you charge the device). There\u2019s now a screen lock feature to prevent other people from using your console \u2014 something that would have been nice to have on the original. The speakers, while not best in class, are a vast upgrade over the hollow, thin sound that came from the Switch OLED Model, released in 2021. The console\u2019s software interface is similar to the first Switch with some new splashes of color and sound effects thrown in. Nintendo\u2019s eShop store for digital game purchases is also more responsive than the sluggish experience on the original console. The buzzy launch drew long lines at retailers including Best Buy Co., GameStop Corp., Target Corp. and Walmart Inc. The era of spending hours waiting in line for the latest iPhone is long gone, but the debut of a new video game console is still a rare enough event that Nintendo fans didn\u2019t think twice about driving to retailers in the middle of the night to secure a Switch 2. It will take more testing and longer play sessions to gauge whether the Switch 2\u2019s more powerful processor has an adverse effect on battery life \u2014 or if there are any performance issues with the large library of backward-compatible Switch titles available for this new hardware. But at the outset, the device makes a strong first impression. Nintendo played it safe with the Switch 2, but that\u2019s precisely what many customers were looking for: It\u2019s a bigger, faster, more polished version of a wildly successful gadget.
