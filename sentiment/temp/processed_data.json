        "content": "Admittedly, trying to ponder stocks that might become worth more thanNvidiamay seem unimaginable. When demand for AI accelerators surged out of nowhere, so did Nvidia stock, and it is now a stock with a $3.85 trillionmarket cap, the world's largest. However, looking to the future, investors may begin to consider which stocks might outpace Nvidia over the next five years. While a lot could happen over that period, these are likely the stocks with the best chance of surpassing Nvidia. Image source: Getty Images. Admittedly,Tesla's(TSLA0.04%)current business does not look like a record breaker. Automobile sales have fallen recently, and itsP/E ratioof 176 is pricey, especially considering itsforward P/E ratioof 172 may imply little additional near-term upside. Still, investors should examinewhyTesla trades at a 172 forward multiple, and the answer is likely autonomous driving. Tesla has invested heavily in AI and robotics to develop its platform. It has also begun to roll out robotaxis on the road in Austin, Texas. To that end, Tesla just demonstrated a fully autonomous delivery of a Model Y to a customer 30 minutes away from its Gigafactory in that city. Cathie Wood's team at Ark Invest saw that breakthrough coming. Amid that research, Ark Invest forecast a $2,900 per share price target for the company by 2029. That would amount to a market cap of $9.3 trillion, far above Nvidia's current market cap. Why so high? Ark Invest believes that by 2029, its self-driving platform revenue will surpass the revenue earned from automobile sales and predicts the robotaxi will make up 63% of the company's revenue by that year. Indeed, the robotaxi trials still need to succeed, and Tesla faces competition fromUber,Alphabet's Waymo, and platforms like the ones being developed by Nvidia andQualcomm. Still, its combined development of cars and the platforms that drive them may give Tesla a leg up on its way to surpassing the AI chip giant. That success should also dramatically reduce its P/E ratio, likely serving as a catalyst for a much higher stock price. Meta Platforms(META0.73%)has built its company on dominating social media. Its social media platforms now draw over 3.4 billion people daily to at least one of its platforms. With that popularity, the digital advertising business built around those users has given it a market cap of almost $1.86 trillion, approximately half of Nvidia's size. Unfortunately for the Facebook parent, its user base now makes up over 40% of the world's population, which will probably mean slower growth for its digital ad business moving forward. However, its aforementioned user base has given the company a treasure trove of user data that is likely unmatched by any other company. Since the data is likely to be of a more personal nature than data compiled by Google orApple, Meta likely holds a competitive advantage. With that, it plans to apply that data to build its strength in the AI realm. To achieve this, it is on track to spend between $64 billion and $72 billion this year alone to invest in this business. Much of that will fund a data center building binge, including a $10 billion, four million square foot facility in Louisiana. Additionally, Meta is in a strong position from a valuation standpoint. Its P/E ratio of 29 closely approximates theS&P 500average and is far below Nvidia's 51 earnings multiple. Theprice-to-sales (P/S) ratioconfirms this discount, as Meta's sales multiple of 11 is far below Nvidia's P/S ratio of 26. Indeed, Meta will have to prove itself. For now, its 16% revenue growth in the first quarter of 2025 is far below Nvidia's 69% increase in the first quarter of fiscal 2026 (ended April 27). Nonetheless, if Meta's AI strategy succeeds, its relatively low valuation and value in the AI market could make it a much larger company over the next five years.",

        "header": "Could This Surprise Company Become Nvidia's Biggest Competitor?",
        "content": "Nvidia(NVDA1.28%)has long been the dominant player in theartificial intelligence (AI)infrastructure market. Itsgraphics processing units (GPUs)are the main chips used to power AI workloads, while itsCUDAsoftware platform has helped create a wide moat. However, if there is a surprise company that can challenge Nvidia, it'sAlphabet(GOOGL0.54%)(GOOG0.51%). Today, most companies running AI workloads use Nvidia's chips. However, Alphabet has turned to its own in-house chips called Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) to help reduce costs and improve performance. Alphabet uses TPUs internally for AI workloads, but it also rents the chips to outside developers. It was initially reported that OpenAI was renting Alphabet's TPUs to help run ChatGPT, although the company has since said it is just testing the chips and not looking to deploy them at scale at this time. Nonetheless, this is a big development. OpenAI is one of Nvidia's largest customers and a Google rival, and the fact that it is looking at Alphabet's TPUs demonstrate the capabilities and cost advantages its chips can provide. What makes TPUs so compelling is that they are specifically designed for Google's infrastructure, giving them advantages in latency, scalability, and cost. As the market starts to shift towardAI inference, Alphabet's TPUs could become a better choice than GPUs. Meanwhile, Alphabet recently introduced a TPU specifically designed for inference called Ironwood in April. Alphabet's vertical integration also gives it a potential edge. It's one of the few companies that can offer custom AI chips, a top-tiercloud-computingplatform, and a full software platform. Nvidia may dominate GPUs, but it doesn't offer a cloud-computing platform. This is something that Alphabet can take advantage of, especially with inference where pricing and latency are more important considerations. The market backdrop is also favorable for Alphabet. Spending on AI infrastructure is expected to remain strong, with Nvidia projecting global data centercapital expenditures (capex)to surpass $1 trillion by 2028. At the same time, many experts are predicting that inference will become a much larger market than model training. AI inference is much less technically challenging than AI training, which helps negate some of Nvidia's CUDA advantage. This could lead to more companies looking for chips that can provide cheaper costs per inference compared to GPUs. That said, it isn't likely that Alphabet is going to ever to take a huge amount of share away from Nvidia. However, even small share gains in inference workloads could be a big boost for Google Cloud. That's because TPU adoption would directly feed into Google Cloud usage as well. Google Cloud has been growing revenue quickly, with revenue climbing 28% year over year last quarter to $12.3 billion. More importantly, segment profitability has hit an inflection point, with segment operating income soaring 142% to $2.2 billion. TPUs help boost Google Cloud's profits, not just by bringing in new customers but by lowering costs as well. And it doesn't stop just with chips. Alphabet has also developed all-optical switches that significantly reduce the power consumption and cost of TPUs. This gives the company strong operating leverage that the market currently isn't appreciating. Image source: Getty Images. Right now, Alphabet trades at a discount to other AI leaders, with aforward price-to-earnings (P/E)ratio of 18 times based on current year analyst estimates. Investors still largely view it as a search company whose core business could be disrupted by AI, while ignoring the big advantages in search it has with its distribution and global ad network reach. They also underestimate the company's strong AI offerings. Gemini is consistently ranked as one of the top AI models in independent tests, and its app has seen downloads surge. It also has the best text-to-video generator on the market with Veo 3 and is incorporating AI features into its search offering. And let's not forget the company also owns the world's most-viewed streaming platform in YouTube, and its Waymo robotaxi business has been seeing strong momentum. Alphabet's TPUs are another big potential growth driver. Nvidia's lead is massive, but if Alphabet can land a major customer like OpenAI and expand TPU adoption, it has a chance to become one of Nvidia's biggest competitors in inference in the future. And if that happens, Alphabet's stock should move meaningfully higher.",

        "content": "The start of this week not only saw the wrapping up of another month of trading but also marked the end of a volatile first half, in which markets were gripped by US president Donald Trump's tariffs and geopolitical conflicts. The de-escalation in trade tensions between the US and China was one major development this month. After Trump accused China of violating the deal the two countries made in Geneva, June got off to a rocky start with concerns that a trade truce had already faltered. However, following a phone call between Trump and China's president Xi Jinping, trade representatives met in London and later announced that a framework to move forward had been agreed. Towards the end of June, Trump announced that theUS and China had signed a deal. Read more:Stocks that are trending today As tariff tensions eased, conflict in the Middle East escalated with Israel and Iran launching air strikes as talks with the US over Tehran's nuclear programme appeared to have stalled. Trump announced a US-brokered ceasefire, which Israel later accused Iran of breaking, before the US president intervened again to help re-establish the truce that appears to have held since last week. The focus has now shifted back to the progress of trade talks between the US and its trading partners, as asthe 9 July deadlinefor the resumption of Trump's \"reciprocal\" tariffs looms. In terms of market performance last month, the UK's FTSE 100 (^FTSE) hit a fresh record high on 12 June, closing at 8884.90 points, but then ebbed lower before recovering some ground at the end of the month. Meanwhile, US markets had a steadier June, before the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and the tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) notched new record highs at the end of the month. Here's which stocks proved most popular with investors in June: Electric vehicle (EV) company Tesla (TSLA) appeared on the most-bought lists of Interactive Investor, Robinhood (HOOD) and AJ Bell (AJB.L). Despite CEO Elon Musk leaving his role heading up Trump's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) at the end of May and refocusing his attention back on Tesla, the stock had another rocky month in June and is down more than 25% year-to-date. Dan Lane, lead analyst at Robinhood UK, said: \"The world finally got a look at Tesla\u2019s Model Y in June. Elon Musk praised its 'FULLY autonomous' capabilities on X, which might have added to investor appetite over the month. \"Tesla is still struggling in China though, with smartphone maker, Xiaomi, adding pressure by joining the EV race.\" Defence stocks remained popular with investors last month, boosted towards the end of the month byNATO allies announcingthat they had agreed to increase their defence spending to 5% of their countries' gross domestic product (GDP) by 2035. FTSE 100-listed (^FTSE) Rolls-Royce (RR.L) was one of the most popular stocks for investors using Interactive Investor and AJ Bell's platforms. In fact, the stock closed the month on a new fresh high and is up more than 64% year-to-date. Fellow UK defence stock BAE System (BA.L), which is up nearly 60% so far this year, also appeared on Interactive Investor and AJ Bell's lists. Read more:The key investing trends in June, from defence stocks to Tesla's sales slump Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor, said: \"Engine maker Rolls Royce topped the leaderboard of most bought equities in June on the interactive investor platform, unsurprisingly given its stellar stock market performance.\" \"Longer-term Rolls Royce is the best performing stock on the FTSE 100 (^FTSE) over a two-, three- and five-year time period,\" she said. \"Both Rolls Royce and BAE Systems ... have benefitted from increased UK defence spending this year as prime minister Kier Starmer plans to move the UK to \u2018warfighting readiness\u2019,\" Scholar added. \"BAE has also been a standout stock market winner with shares up by more than 60% over the past six months.\" The second most popular stock on Robinhood's list was Applied Digital (APLD), which designs and operates digital infrastructure. Shares in Applied Digital are up 38% year-to-date and hit an all-time high earlier in June, after the companyannounced a $7bn dealwith CoreWeave (CRWV), the cloud services provider backed by Nvidia (NVDA). Applied Digital said that it had entered into two approximately 15-year lease agreements with CoreWeave. Under the agreement, Applied Digital will deliver 250 megawatts of critical IT load to host CoreWeave's AI and high-performing computing (HPC) infrastructure at its Ellendale, North Dakota data centre campus. Applied Digital said it anticipating generating approximately $7bn (\u00a35.1bn) in total revenue from the leases. Mining stocks also proved popular in June, including minerals exploration and development company Metals One (MET1.L). Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, said: \"Metals One was popular with investors looking to \u2018buy the dip\u2019. \"The mining company enjoyed a big share price rally in April and May after striking deals to expand in the US via uranium and gold exploration projects. The shares then pulled back sharply, perhaps prompting certain investors to swoop on price weakness in the hope it might rebound again.\" Shares are up 368% year-to-date, with the rally in shares in May seeing the stock hitting its highest point since listing on the UK's alternative investment market (AIM) in August 2023. Oil major BP (BP.L) also featured on the most popular stocks lists in June for Interactive Investor and AJ Bell (AJB.L). Interactive Investor's Scholar said: \"Not only has the company seen its share price caught up in the oil market\u2019s volatility amid tensions in the Middle East, but it has also been subject to takeover speculation from Shell. However, Shell has denied any acquisition interest in its rival.\" A volatile first half of the year, has left BP shares 3% in the red year-to-date. Investors' favourite stocks throughout the first six months of the year reflected continued market interest in key themes, such as technology and defence. While chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) had a challenging start to the year with the release of DeepSeek's lower cost AI model, followed by Trump's sweeping tariffs and controls on sales of its H20 chips to China. However, the stock has since seen a marked turnaround, with Nvidia posting strong first quarter results in May, showing the company continued to perform despite the export curbs on its chips to China. Stocks:Create your watchlist and portfolio Ahead of those results, Nvidia alsoannounced deals with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emiratesto supply them with hundreds of thousands of its AI chips. AJ Bell's Coatsworth said: \"Nvidia might have been caught up in the global market sell-off in April, but plenty of investors still have faith in the AI story. Their patience has been rewarded after the shares hit a new record high during June.\" UK financial stocks also proved popular, with Legal & General (LGEN.L), Lloyds Banking Group (LLOY.L) and HSBC (HSBA.L), featuring on the lists. Despite volatility, investors continued to put money into US and global passive funds in June, giving them exposure to some of the world's biggest companies, such as the \"Magnificent 7\" tech behemoths. At the same time, Victoria Hasler, head of fund research at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \"The turbulence that we saw in the second quarter of the year has tempted some investors back into active funds, trusting active managers to navigate the volatility on their behalf. \"There were three active funds in the top ten list for June \u2014 all three are global equity funds, and all three well-established funds with proven track records. In this environment it seems that investors prefer to stick with the funds they know and trust.\" Exposure to US and global markets, particularly through passive funds, was a dominant theme in throughout the first half of the year. Jason Hollands, managing director at Bestinvest by Evelyn Partners, said: Given the relatively poor performance of US equities in the first half of the year, with the fallout from Donald Trump\u2019s tariff war and a plunging US dollar, it is notable that despite this four of the top ten fund purchases on Bestinvest were US equities funds. \"There were no European funds present in the top ten, despite a much stronger start to the year,\" he said. \"It is pleasingly to see a solitary UK equity fund in the top 10, Artemis UK Select (0P0000V25A.L), which is one of our top fund picks. It\u2019s a best ideas fund that backs undervalued growth companies.\" Read more: What to watch this week: UK shop prices, US employment, Constellation Brands, M&S and Sainsbury's Global economy to slow amid 'most severe trade war since 1930s', says Fitch UK economy grew 0.7% in first quarter of the year Download the Yahoo Finance app, available forAppleandAndroid.",

These adjustments can be used to increase the share price (in a reverse split) or to make shares more nominally affordable (in a forward split).

        "content": "Navitas Semiconductor(NVTS1.74%), a producer of gallium nitride (GaN) and silicon carbide (SiC) chips, went public by merging with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) on Oct. 21, 2021. Shares started trading at $13, and the price rallied to an all-time high of $22.19 on Nov. 12, 2021. At the time, investors were dazzled by its ambitious long-term forecasts. The buying frenzy in meme stocks in late 2021 amplified those gains and inflated its valuations. But like many otherSPACstart-ups, Navitas missed management's own growth estimates. Rising interest rates compressed its valuations, and its stock sank to an all-time low of $1.52 on April 4, 2025. Image source: Getty Images. But today, the stock trades at about $6 a share. Most of that rally occurred in late May, when a new partnership withNvidiainartificial intelligence (AI) data centerssqueezed out its short-sellers. That short squeeze, along with other follow-on partnerships, brought back the bulls. So will it eventually deliver millionaire-making gains for its investors? Navitas generates most of its revenue from its GaNFast Power integrated circuits (ICs). They use GaN power transistors -- which are faster and more power efficient than traditional silicon transistors -- to support switching, sensing, control, and security features on a single chip. Its transistors are used in mobile fast chargers, EV chargers, laptop adapters, data center power supplies, solar inverters, industrial motor drives, and energy storage. The company says its ICs provide three times the power with 40% energy savings at half the size and weight of traditional silicon power systems, and it has already shipped more than 50 million GaN units. In 2022, Navitas entered the SiC market by acquiring GeneSiC. These SiC chips are also more resistant to higher temperatures and voltages than silicon chips, so they're often used in many of the same products as GaN chips. Most of that smaller SiC segment's growth is being driven by the EV and data center markets. With its combined portfolio, Navitas' major customers now includeDell, which uses GaN/SiC chips in its notebook adapters; the Chinese automaker Changan, which uses its GaN ICs in its on-board EV chargers; and Nvidia, which chose Navitas' chips to power the architecture for its AI workloads in its next-gen data centers. Navitas is a fabless chipmaker, which means it outsources its production to third-party foundries. That capital-light model enables it to focus on developing new chips instead of burning too much cash on the expansion of its own foundries. Before its public debut, Navitas set some ambitious growth targets. From 2020 to 2024, management believed it could grow its revenue from $12 million to $308 million, expand its adjusted gross margin from 33% to 53%, and for its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) to turn positive in 2023. But in reality, its revenue only rose to $83 million in 2024, its adjusted gross margin expanded to 42%, and its adjusted EBITDA stayed in the red. The company was still growing at an impressive rate, but it disappointed its early investors. That slowdown was caused by macro headwinds for the EV, solar, and industrial markets -- which were expected to drive the expansion of the GaN and SiC markets -- in 2023 and 2024. The company also ended a key distribution deal for its SiC products in late 2024, and selling a higher mix of lower-margin GaN chips (as opposed to its higher-margin SiC chips) reduced its gross margins. As top-line growth slowed, rising research and development costs further compressed its margins. It reduced its inventories and receivables to clean up its balance sheet during the downturn, but those strategies throttled its near-term revenue growth. From 2024 to 2027, analysts expect Navitas' revenue to have a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17%, taking it from $83 million to $134 million. They also expect its adjusted EBITDA to turn positive in 2027. That expansion should be driven by its deal with Nvidia, which will be ramped up in 2026 and be deployed on a broader scale in 2027; as well as the broader use of SiC chips in EV chargers, and the rising adoption of fast chargers for laptops and other consumer electronics. From 2025 to 2030, the global GaN market could have a CAGR of 27.4%, according to Grand View Research. MarketsandMarkets expects SiC sales to show a CAGR of 32.6% from 2024 to 2029. So even though both markets face near-term headwinds, they should keep expanding as they replace traditional silicon chips. But with a market cap of $1.26 billion, Navitas' stock isn't cheap at 20 times this year's sales. Assuming its revenue achieves a CAGR of 15% from 2024 to 2035 and still trades at 20 times its forward sales by the final year, its market cap would rise nearly sixfold to $7.38 billion. That would be a decent long-term gain, but it probably won't make you a millionaire. Navitas is still a good growth stock, but investors should maintain realistic expectations for its future.",

        "header": "SoundHound AI Stock Has Plummeted by 53%. This Move by Nvidia Is a Key Reason Why.",
        "content": "SoundHound AI(SOUN-1.11%)is a specialist in conversational artificial intelligence (AI) software, which understands voice prompts and responds in kind. Its customers include some of the world's biggest brands, and it even attracted an investment fromNvidia(NVDA1.28%). Nvidia supplies the world's most powerful data center chips for AI development, and booming sales have driven its market capitalization from $360 billion to $3.83trillionover the last two and a half years alone. Therefore, it's no surprise SoundHound AI stock soared higher when Nvidia revealed it bought a position in early 2024, and shares went on to hit an all-time high of around $24 in late 2024. But Nvidia stunned investors when it released its 13-F filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Feb. 14 this year. Its updated list of investments showed that SoundHound AI was no longer in the portfolio, suggesting the chip giant sold its entire stake toward the end of 2024. SoundHound stock has now lost 53% of its peak value, and it's struggling to regain momentum. Could the decline be a long-term buying opportunity, or is Nvidia's exit a sign to steer clear? Image source: Getty Images. Popular AI chatbots likeOpenAI'sChatGPT are incredibly powerful, but they aren't always accessible. For example, people might not have the capacity to open an app or manually enter prompts when they are working or even driving, but SoundHound's conversationalAIsoftware was designed for those very situations, and adoption is soaring among some of the world's biggest brands. They include quick-service restaurant chains likeChipotle,Krispy Kreme,Papa John's, and Jersey Mike's. They use SoundHound products like Employee Assist, which workers can speak to whenever they need help with menu items, systems, and store policies. The chains also use SoundHound to take customers' orders autonomously in-store, over the phone, and in the drive-thru, which frees up staff to complete those orders more quickly. Automotive giants likeHyundai,Honda, andKiaare integrating SoundHound into their new cars, where it can help drivers understand different features and even provide them with information on things like the weather or sports scores on command. SoundHound also launched a platform called Voice Commerce this year, which includes products like In-Car Ordering. Users can ask for restaurant recommendations while they are driving, place an order, and get directions to pick it up -- all powered by their voice. SoundHound acquired another conversational AI specialist called Amelia last year, which is helping the company expand its product portfolio. The new Amelia 7.0 platform allows businesses to create custom conversational AI agents to handle queries from their customers and employees. These agents can be trained to answer questions on specific products or topics, and they can also be instructed to avoid sensitive areas like politics. SoundHound'srevenuecame in at $29.1 million during the first quarter of 2025 (ended March 31), which represented eye-popping growth of 151% compared to the year-ago period. The strong result gave management the confidence to reaffirm its full-year guidance, which suggests the company could generate $167 million in revenue during 2025 (at the midpoint of the forecasted range). That would be an increase of 97% from its 2024 result. SoundHound is also sitting on an enormous order backlog. Management is no longer updating investors on the official number, but Chief Financial Officer Nitesh Sharan said it has grown even further since the end of 2024, when it was a whopping $1.2 billion. The company expects to convert the backlog into revenue over the next six years, so it's a good indication that more top-line growth is on the horizon. But SoundHound's bottom line remains a concern. The company actually generated a profit of $129.9 million during the first quarter on aGAAP(generally accepted accounting principles) basis, but only because of a one-off benefit of $176 million from one of its acquisitions. On anon-GAAPbasis, which excludes one-off and non-cash expenses, SoundHound still lost $22.3 million, which was up 10% year over year. The first-quarter loss followed a non-GAAP net loss of $69.1 million in 2024, and since the company only has $246 million in cash and equivalents on hand, it can't afford to keep burning money at the current pace. If it doesn't turn profitable soon, a capital raise might be required in the future, which would dilute existing shareholders and dent their potential returns. Nvidiamanagement never shares the reasons for any changes it makes to its investment portfolio, but SoundHound's sky-high valuation is definitely something investors should consider before buying the stock. It's trading at aprice-to-sales (P/S) ratioof 39.3 as of this writing, which is a whopping 50% premium to Nvidia's P/S ratio of 26.1.  Data byYCharts. Nvidia is a high-quality company. It has a track record of success that spans decades, and it generated $130.5 billion in total revenue during its last fiscal year alone, along with $72.9 billion in net income. Considering SoundHound's business is still at a very early stage and is losing significant amounts of money, its premium valuation is very hard to justify. No matter what Nvidia's official reasons were for selling SoundHound stock, its sharp decline in the aftermath hasn't made it an attractive buy, so I think investors should steer clear for now.",

        "content": "Nvidia(NVDA1.28%)has soared to the top of the list of most valuable companies in the world thanks to its best-in-classgraphics processing units(GPUs). Nvidia's chips are essential for traininglarge language modelsand using them in applications. As big tech companies race to build better and better AI capabilities, they've been buying up Nvidia's chips as fast as the company can provide them. As Nvidia approaches a $4 trillion market capitalization, few other companies are even close to that value.Microsoftis the only other company with a value above $3.5 trillion. But I expect that two other companies will surpass Nvidia's valuation within three years, even though they're currently worth between 50% and 60% of Nvidia's market value. Image source: Nvidia. As I write this, Nvidia is within 4% of the $4 trillion milestone. Not only would that make it the first company to surpass that value, it would also come after extremely fast growth. The company was worth less than $1 trillion just a couple of years ago. A company that large growing that fast is an incredible refutation of the law of large numbers. Two factors have been driving Nvidia's strong stock performance. First, its revenue growth has continued to impress. Total revenue climbed 69% in the first quarter to $44.1 billion. On top of that, it's produced an extremely high gross margin each quarter as demand continues to outstrip its supply for new chip designs. Adjusted gross margin in the first quarter was 71.3%. The combination has led to incredible earnings growth for the business. While Nvidia has managed to stay ahead of competing chipmakers in the GPU space, its biggest competitors areshowing signs of catching up in performance. On top of that, a huge chunk of its business is concentrated in just a handful of big customers. And those customers are actively working to move more of their AI workloads onto custom chip designs made by other chipmakers in order to improve cost performance. Those customers are also incentivized to explore alternatives to Nvidia in order to prevent the chipmaker from price gouging them. While Nvidia should continue to take the bulk of the share in AI chip sales, its stock is priced as if the above threats didn't exist. That makes it a risky investment right now, and it's not unreasonable to expect slower growth in the stock over the next three years. That gives an opportunity for two undervalued tech giants to surpass the chipmaker in market cap. These two look like they could grow well beyond Nvidia over the next three years. Amazon(AMZN1.62%)operates the second-largest retail business in the world and the largest cloud computing platform in the world. Like Nvidia, Amazon has seen its business benefit from the growing spending on artificial intelligence (AI). Despite its slow start in thegenerative AIspace, Amazon Web Services (AWS) has managed to maintain its leading position and offer compelling AI services to developers. During its first-quarter earnings call, CEO Andy Jassy said its AI business is generating multiple billions of revenue for AWS and growing at triple-digit percentage rate. That strong growth has helped expand the operating margin for AWS, which climbed to 39.5% in the first quarter. At the same time, management says demand for its servers exceeds its supply, so it's spending heavily to expand its capacity. Totalcapital expenditureswill total over $100 billion this year, management says. Most of that will go toward building and outfitting new data centers. Amazon's massive cash outlay for its growing cloud computing business is supported bythe recent strength of its retail operations. In particular the company has pushed its operating margin significantly higher over the last couple of years, thanks, in part, to a reorganization of its U.S. logistics. It's now able to ship more items to customers with faster speeds, which has also helped keep its shipping expenses low as a percentage of sales. Additionally, Amazon has seen strong growth in its high-margin advertising sales. Overall, its North American retail operating margin has expanded to 6.6% of the last 12 months and its international segment turned positive last year. There are a couple of reasons Amazon should see its value increase substantially over the next three years. First, the strong results of its cloud and retail operations should continue for the foreseeable future. As the leading cloud provider, it's still in pole position to attract enterprises looking to utilize AI in their operations. Second, the company should see strong free-cash-flow growth over the next three years, as it sees growing spending on AWS with smaller steps up in capital expenditures. That could push the company toward $100 billion in free cash flow in short order. If the stock offers a 2.5% free-cash-flow yield, which is below its historical average, that would make it a $4 trillion company. Meta Platforms(META0.73%)is the largest social media company in the world with over 3.4 billion unique users across its family of apps. It's also a leading developer of virtual and augmented reality technology. Meta has been spending heavily on developing artificial intelligence for years, recently stepping up its investments as generative AI shows the promise to completely transform its business. Not only is Meta planning about $70 billion of capital expenditures this year to build out data centers, it's also been on a hiring spree recently. That includes a$14.3 billion investment in Scale AI, which led the company's CEO to migrate to Meta and head up its new AI super intelligence lab. The company is working to catch up with leading models after its Llama 4 model disappointed developers. But with the speed of change in the industry, Meta has the capability of doing just that. The impact of AI on Meta's operations over the last couple of years is already notable. The company's ad revenue climbed 16% in the first quarter on the back of both higher engagement and higher ad prices. But both could get a boost from further advances in AI. Meta is now working on an AI agent that can develop, test, and optimize ad campaigns for marketers. This could increase existing marketers' willingness to spend on ads while bringing in new advertisers to the Meta ads ecosystem. And if AI is better at tailoring ads to individuals than humans, it could result in higher conversions, further supporting higher ad spending on Meta's platform. That capability also speaks to Meta's ability to develop AI-generated content unique for each of its users to boost overall engagement on its platform and increase advertising opportunities. Meta's already experimenting with limited AI-generated content in its feeds. This should support strong revenue growth for Meta over the next few years, even as it spends heavily on both generative AI and its Reality Labs segment. And if AI can push more consumers to buy wearables like Meta's AI glasses or Oculus headsets, that could further support strong margin expansion for the business. The stock currently trades for 29 times forward earnings expectations. But I predict Meta will outperform existing expectations over the next three years and the stock will climb rapidly as a result. Even if it maintains its current earnings multiple, average earnings growth of just 14.5% over the next three years -- in line with analysts expectations -- should push the stock more than 50% higher from here, approaching $3 trillion. And there's a lot of upside from here.",

        "content": "After plummeting during the stock market sell-off in April, the tech sector has bounced back. The tech-heavyNasdaq Compositeis now back in a bull market and ended June by reaching a new record high. Are you looking for quality tech companies to add to your portfolio? Here are three leaders in the industry that should be long-term winners. Image source: Getty Images. You could make a strong argument that no company has benefited from the growth ofartificial intelligence(AI) likeNvidia(NVDA1.28%). Many of the biggest tech companies rely on Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) for AI and machine-learning tasks. While Nvidia isn't the only GPU company, it's widely considered to design the most powerful ones. Nvidia has been on an incredible run since the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT on Nov. 22, 2022. Revenue has increased by 628% from that point until its most recent quarterly earnings, when it reported revenue of $44.1 billion. NVDA Revenue (Quarterly)data byYCharts. Nvidia has some potential downsides. First, it could be overvalued. It's the largest company by market cap and trades at aforward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E)of 36.8, at the time of this writing (June 30). Nvidia is on the expensive side, although its excellent financial performance arguably justifies the valuation. Another headwind is that sometech companies, includingAlphabet,Amazon, andMeta Platforms, have invested in custom AI chips to better fit their needs. By designing their own chips, they aren't as reliant on Nvidia. However, those three companies (and many others) still use Nvidia GPUs and will likely continue to do so, even if they also incorporate custom chips. Plus, Nvidia looks like it will play a key role in sovereign AI -- the ability of sovereign nations to advance their AI technology. In May, Nvidia announced plans to build AI data centers in Saudi Arabia. While Nvidia is likely past its hyper-growth stage, it should continue to be an important player in the growth of AI. Semiconductorsare an essential part of most modern electronic devices, including smartphones, computers, and gaming consoles.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(TSM0.75%)is the top semiconductor foundry, with a massive 68% share of the global foundry market. Most big tech companies can't manufacture chips themselves. Instead, they work with Taiwan Semiconductor, or TSMC for short. It makes chips for a wide range of clients, includingAMD,Apple,Broadcom, Nvidia, andSony. TSMC's dominant market position provides a rare mix of safety and growth potential. Since clients depend on TSMC for their chips, its services should continue to be in demand. It has also been growing rapidly, due to the increase in semiconductor spending. The company's share price is up 30% over the last year, and it reported $25.5 billion in revenue in Q1 2025, a 35% year-over-year increase. To top it off, TSMC shares are reasonably priced right now. It trades at a forward P/E ratio of 24, slightly higher than theS&P 500but less than the Nasdaq Composite. Several entertainment companies have tried their hands at streaming, but none have matchedNetflix(NFLX0.92%)in terms of popularity. It has 301.6 million paid subscribers, nearly 100 million more than any otherstreaming service. It also accounted for 7.5% of TV and streaming viewing in May, according to Nielsen data. Netflix started offering ad-supported plans in 2022, a move that has helped it increase its subscriber base and earnings. The streamer reported in May that it has 94 million active users on ad-supported plans, compared to 40 million a year before. Revenue and operating income are both on the rise -- by 13% and 27% year over year, respectively, as of Netflix's first-quarter earnings report. Overall, this is a strong business that's delivering excellent financial growth. The biggest issue is the cost, as Netflix currently trades at a forward P/E of 52.2. Yes, it's expensive, but it's also only scratching the surface of its ad business. Analysts estimate that Netflix will make about $2 billion in ad revenue this year, a small portion of the company's projected revenue of $43 billion to $44 billion. Research firm MoffettNathanson projects that Netflix could reach $10 billion in ad revenue by 2030. Nvidia, TSMC, and Netflix are at the top of their respective markets, and all three have seen significant growth in their revenue and share prices.

        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) stocks are attracting significant attention, as technology companies compete to offer the best AI services. There have already been some big winners, like semiconductor companyNvidia, but there are plenty of AI stocks that once looked like a sure bet and seem less so now. SoundHound AI(SOUN-1.11%)is one such company. The company's stock soared 300% over the past three years, but is down 45% since the beginning of this year. Lots of small start-ups have volatile share prices, so it's worth taking a closer look at SoundHound AI to see what's happening with the company. While its tech is promising, I think it's best not to buySoundHound AI stockright now. Here's why. Image source: Getty Images. There are a few good reasons why investors have been interested in SoundHound, including the company's impressive revenue growth. SoundHound's sales increased 151% in the first quarter (which ended March 31) to $29 million. That kind of revenue jump is exactly what you want to see from a young company that's carving out a niche in a new market. What's more, SoundHound appears to be successfully attracting large customers to its conversational AI platform. This includes working with Chinese tech companyTencentto bring SoundHound's voice-activated services into more automotive brands, and expanding the locations that use its tech to include Firehouse Subs restaurants, Five Guys, and others. SoundHound also doesn't have any debt, and the company finished Q1 with $246 million in cash and cash equivalents. The lack of debt is impressive for a start-up that's already expanded its AI business and attracted significant customers. Finally, as tech companies race to implement better AI into their products and services, many will need conversational AI solutions that allow their customers to interact easily with their artificial intelligence programs. That's causing a rapid expansion of the conversational AI market, which will be worth an estimated $152 billion by 2033. One concern for potential SoundHound investors is that the company isn't profitable and could take a while to get there. SoundHound reported anon-GAAPloss of $0.06 in Q1, up from a loss of $0.07 in the year-ago quarter. Its gross margins also fell to 51% in the quarter, down from their previous 66%. Second, and perhaps most important, is that SoundHound's rapid share price gains over the past several years have made its stock very expensive. The company's shares currently have aprice-to-salesof 35, far above the average of about 7 for internet software companies. SoundHound's sales would have to continue growing at a breakneck speed to justify its stock's current valuation. With the company's substantial losses and high valuation, I think it's best not to buy SoundHound AI's stock right now. There are plenty of other profitableAI stocksthat are far less risky and have lower valuations, which makes SoundHound's shares not seem worth the risk.",

        "header": "Better Artificial Intelligence Stock: IonQ vs. Nvidia",
        "content": "With the share prices of so many tech companies surging lately, it's a good idea to turn a critical eye toward any stock you're considering buying. Two stocks that are no doubt on many investors' potential buying lists areNvidia(NVDA1.28%)andIonQ(IONQ-0.80%), These companies have garnered lots of attention lately, especially as their share prices have risen 930% and 857% over the past three years, respectively. So, let's take a closer look at what's happening with these companies to determine which one looks like the betterAI stockto own in early July, 2025. Nvidiaquickly went from an obscure tech company that most people hadn't heard about to one of the most popular artificial intelligence investments in just a few years. The spike in interest has come from Nvidia's lead in designing semiconductors that are used in artificial intelligence data centers. Nvidia's processors account for about 70% to 94% of the AI semiconductor market, and their popularity has pushed the company's sales and earnings up quickly. Nvidia's data center revenue spiked 73% in the most recent quarter to $39 billion, and earnings per share rose 27% to $0.76 per share. There is some debate as to how much more semiconductor demand there will be in the coming years once tech giants have upgraded their old servers and built new ones to handle their AI needs, but that potential slowdown hasn't arrived yet. McKinsey research estimates that the semiconductor market will grow to $2.4 trillion by 2040, up from about $450 billion in 2019. With Nvidia's semiconductor lead, the company is well-positioned to benefit if semiconductor demand remains. Still, one thing investors should be aware of is that Nvidia's stock isn't cheap. The rapid share price gains of the past few years mean that Nvidia's stock has aprice-to-earningsratio of about 50, which is below the current semiconductor company average of 64 but still pricey compared to theS&P 500's average of 24. IonQ isn't actually an artificial intelligence company. It's a quantum computing company that uses trapped linear chain ions that have the potential to reach 100-plus qubits and produce far fewer errors than other quantum computers. WhereIonQoverlaps slightly with AI is that it offers some of its quantum computing services onAmazon's AWS andMicrosoft's Azure cloud computing platforms, giving AI researchers access to quantum computing processing. Additionally, future developments in quantum computing could result in smarter AI models. Investors have been pushing up IonQ's share price, hoping that quantum computing will eventually become a transformational technology. But most real-world applications -- like using it to discover new drugs or materials -- haven't happened yet. And even some companies heavily involved in developing their own quantum computers, likeAlphabet's Google, have said commercial quantum computing applications are still at least five years away. Still, the quantum computing market will be worth an estimated $2 trillion by 2035. This massive opportunity has helped fuel investor optimism in IonQ, but it's also resulted in making its stock extremely expensive. IonQ'sprice-to-salesratio is an astonishingly high 217, far above the market's average or even other high-flying tech stocks. While Nvidia's share price isn't cheap, it's a far better value than IonQ's. Nvidia's lead in the artificial intelligence semiconductor market, its strong earnings and revenue growth, and its potential to continue tapping into the vast semiconductor market should continue to make Nvidia a good long-term investment. And considering that it's more focused on AI than IonQ, Nvidia is easily the better artificial intelligence stock in this match-up.",

        "content": "Warren Buffett\u2019s decision to step down as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway at the end of the year wasn\u2019t well received by investors. In the five weeks following the announcement, Berkshire's shares fell 9% while the broader market rose 6%. The anticipated evaporating of the \u201cBuffett premium\u201d appears to be underway. For many years, Berkshire Hathaway commanded a higher valuation than the true value of its assets and similar businesses simply because its CEO is Warren Buffett. Buffett is widely considered one of thebest investors of his time, and investors are happy to pay extra to have him managing their money. This is known as the \u201cBuffett premium.\u201d It was perhaps inevitable thatsentiment toward Berkshirewould suffer when Buffett announced his retirement. Buffett tried to prevent an exodus by reassuring investors that his predecessor is a better manager, that he won\u2019t be selling his stock, and that he will stay on as chairman and still be in the office most days. This positive rhetoric, coupled with Greg Abel\u2019s assurances that the investment philosophy won\u2019t change, helped limit the damage but wasn't enough to stop some investors from jumping ship. Berkshire not having the same appeal without Buffett at the helm is just part of the story. Challenges are plentiful and operating profit growth is expected to be minimal in 2025 and 2026, making the shares, which kept rising, look extremely expensive, even by their own high standards. Before Buffett called it quits, investors were perhaps willing to turn a blind eye. Now, he's set to be replaced by a relatively unknown figure, and these challenges are suddenly magnified. Analysts flagged the biggest risks, including pressure to use the large amount of cash Berkshire has amassed better, particularly now that interest rates are falling, which won\u2019t be easy for a company of this stature. On top of that, structural changes in the U.S. economy, climate change, andautonomous drivingcould have a negative impact on companies in Berkshire\u2019s portfolio. Numerous analysts believe Berkshire will no longer be able to command as high a valuation without Buffett in charge. The recent re-rating supports this theory, although it\u2019s still too early to call. Some investors left quickly, while others may wait until after Buffett leaves, or give the new boss a chance to prove himself before passing judgment. To wipe out the Buffett premium, a much bigger sell-off is required.Losing someone as famous and widely respected as Buffett is bound to hurt Berkshire, at least from a perception standpoint.\u00a0For decades, he\u2019s been the reason why many people invest in Berkshire. History, however, suggests investors could look past Buffett's departure. When Steve Jobs died in 2011, many people figured Apple was done. Its share price since then proves they were wrong. Berkshire Hathaway\u2019s falling share priceafter Buffett's departure announcement backed up the theory that the company will no longer be able to justify its premium valuation. But other companies have gone on to flourish without their star boss. Whether Berkshire does, too, will likely depend on what it does with the cash it has. For now, most investors are stillbetting on Abelto continue Berkshire\u2019s winning ways. However, one slip-up could be a reason for doubt that might unsettle investors and end the days of premium price tags.",

        "content": "(Reuters) -Global equity funds attracted strong inflows in the week to July 2, as U.S. stocks hit record highs, with investors brushing off trade tensions and chasing gains in AI-linked sectors. Investors bought global equity funds worth a net $43.15 billion during the week, registering their largest weekly net purchase since November 13, 2024, data from LSEG Lipper showed. While markets remain buoyant, analysts said that equities could face a sharp reversal if the trade tensions potentially flare up again. Micron Technology\u2019s, upbeat fourth-quarter sales forecasts, alongside Nvidia\u2019s rally to a record high reinforced investor confidence in AI-linked tech stocks during the week. U.S. equity funds attracted a hefty $31.6 billion worth of inflows, the highest for a week since November 13, 2024. European and Asian funds pulled in $9.31 billion and $552 million worth of net investments. Investors also added a net $3.72 billion into sectoral funds as they snapped up industrial, technology and financial sector funds worth a net $1.26 billion, $1.2 billion and $760 million, respectively. Weekly inflows into global bond funds amounted to a net $15.84 billion, with strong demand extending into an 11th consecutive week. Euro-denominated bond funds net inflows rose to a three-week high of $4.89 billion. Corporate and short-term bond funds also attracted significant inflows of $4.33 billion and $1.73 billion, respectively. Money market funds, meanwhile, had approximately $57.46 billion worth of net purchases following three weeks of net sales. Among commodity funds, gold and precious metal funds were popular for a sixth successive week, with about $564 million in net inflows.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump\u2019s administration plans to restrict shipments of AI chips from the likes of Nvidia Corp. to Malaysia and Thailand, part of an effort to crack down on suspected semiconductor smuggling into China. Most Read from Bloomberg Foreign Buyers Swoop on Cape Town Homes, Pricing Out Locals Massachusetts to Follow NYC in Making Landlords Pay Broker Fees NYC Commutes Resume After Midtown Bus Terminal Crash Chaos Struggling Downtowns Are Looking to Lure New Crowds What Gothenburg Got Out of Congestion Pricing A draft rule from the Commerce Department seeks to prevent China \u2014 to which the US has effectively banned sales of Nvidia\u2019s advanced AI processors \u2014 from obtaining those components through intermediaries in the two Southeast Asian nations, according to people familiar with the matter. The rule is not yet finalized and could still change, said the people, who requested anonymity to discuss private conversations. Officials plan to pair the Malaysia and Thailand controls with a formal rescission of global curbs from the so-called AI diffusion rule, the people said. That framework from the end of President Joe Biden\u2019s term drew objections from US allies and tech companies, including Nvidia. Washington would maintain semiconductor restrictions targeting China \u2014 imposed in 2022 and ramped up several times since \u2014 as well as more than 40 other countries covered by a 2023 measure, which Biden officials designed to address smuggling concerns and increase visibility into key markets. All told, the regulation would mark the first formal step in Trump\u2019s promised overhaul of his predecessor\u2019s AI diffusion approach \u2014 after the Commerce Department said in May that it would supplant that Biden rule with its own \u201cbold, inclusive strategy.\u201d But the draft measure is far from a comprehensive replacement, the people said. It doesn\u2019t answer, for example, questions about security conditions for the use of US chips in overseas data centers \u2014 a debate with particularly high stakes for the Middle East. It\u2019s unclear whether Trump officials may ultimately regulate AI chip shipments to a wider swath of countries, beyond the Malaysia and Thailand additions. The Commerce Department didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. The agency has offered few specifics about its regulatory vision beyond what Secretary Howard Lutnick told lawmakers last month: The US will \u201callow our allies to buy AI chips, provided they\u2019re run by an approved American data center operator, and the cloud that touches that data center is an approved American operator,\u201d he said during congressional testimony. Nvidia, the dominant maker of AI chips, declined to comment, while spokespeople for the Thai and Malaysian governments didn\u2019t respond. Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang has previously said there\u2019s \u201cno evidence\u201d of AI chip diversion, in general remarks that didn\u2019t touch on any particular country. In response to earlier Bloomberg queries about curbs focused on smuggling risks, Thailand said it\u2019s awaiting details, while Malaysia\u2019s Ministry of Investment, Trade and Industry said clear and consistent policies are essential for the tech sector. Washington officials for years have debated which countries should be able to import American AI chips \u2014 and under what conditions. On one hand, the world wants Nvidia hardware, and US policymakers want the world to build AI systems using American technology \u2014 before China can offer a compelling alternative. On the other, once those semiconductors leave American and allied shores, US officials worry the chips could somehow make their way to China, or that Chinese AI companies could benefit from remote access to data centers outside the Asian country. Southeast Asia is a key focus. Companies including Oracle Corp. are investing aggressively in data centers in Malaysia, and trade data shows that chip shipments there have surged in recent months. Under pressure from Washington, Malaysian officials have pledged to closely scrutinize those imports, but the Commerce Department\u2019s draft rule indicates the US still has concerns. Semiconductor sales to Malaysia also are a focal point of a court case in neighboring Singapore, where prosecutors have charged three men with defrauding customers about the ultimate destination of AI servers \u2014 originally shipped from the island nation to Malaysia \u2014 that may have contained advanced Nvidia chips. (Nvidia is not the subject of Singapore\u2019s investigation and has not been accused of any wrongdoing.) Related: Malaysia Downplays Huawei Deal as US Checks China\u2019s AI Reach The export curbs on Malaysia and Thailand would include several measures to ease pressure on companies with significant business operations there, people familiar with the matter said. One provision would allow firms headquartered in the US and a few dozen friendly nations to continue shipping AI chips to both countries, without seeking a license, for a few months after the rule is published, people familiar with the matter said. The license requirements also would still include certain exemptions to prevent supply chain disruptions, the people said. Many semiconductor companies rely on Southeast Asian facilities for crucial manufacturing steps like packaging, the process of encasing chips for use in devices. --With assistance from Patpicha Tanakasempipat, Michael Shepard and Olivia Solon.

        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has been around for a while, but it gained mainstream popularity in early 2023 due to the rise of generative AI tools like OpenAI's ChatGPT andAlphabet's Google Gemini. Plenty of tech stocks have seen their valuations skyrocket because of the AI boom, but the biggest beneficiary has undoubtedly beenNvidia(NVDA1.28%). Over the past three years, its stock has increased by nearly 920%, while theS&P 500has risen around 64% over the same period. Nvidia has gotten a lot of attention, and rightfully so. Itsgraphics processing units (GPUs)and AI software are very important to the AI ecosystem. However, there's another company that Nvidia relies on heavily that's just as important, and it's a stock I'm loading up on:Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company(TSM0.75%)(TSMC). At first glance, calling a manufacturing company like TSMC anAI stockmight seem unusual, but it's a pivotal player in how the technology all comes together. Let's take a look at how its business works. TSMC is the world's largestsemiconductor (chip)manufacturer and the pioneer of the foundry business model. You can't buy TSMC chips in a store or online like a smartphone or laptop. Instead, companies go to TSMC with their chip designs, and it manufactures them, bringing those designs to life. For example, it makes chips forApple's iPhones,Tesla's self-driving technology,AMD's processors, Nvidia's GPUs, and plenty of other applications. TSMC's relationship with Nvidia and other AI-chip designers is why I'm willing to consider it an \"AI stock,\" even as a chip manufacturing company. In fact, TSMC manufactures the vast majority of all high-performance AI chips, so there's a strong case to be made that without the company and its capabilities, the AI landscape would look significantly different -- for the worse. The increased demand for AI chips is showing up in TSMC's financials. In the first quarter, its revenue increased 35% year over year to $25.5 billion. It expects its Q2 revenue to come in between $28.4 billion and $29.2 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 36% to 40%. That's impressive for a company of TSMC's size.  Data byYCharts. Just three years ago, in Q1 2022, smartphone chips accounted for 40% of TSMC's revenue, while high-performance chips (HPCs), which include AI chips, accounted for 41%. Fast-forward to Q1 this year, and HPCs accounted for 59% of revenue, while smartphones accounted for only 28%. This shift in the composition of the company's top line isn't showing any signs of slowing down. One of the risks facing TSMC's business is the geopolitical tension between Taiwan and China. However, management is working to address this concern by expanding its operations globally. TSMC currently has (or will have soon) manufacturing plants in the U.S., Germany, and Japan. This can help reduce some of its geographical risk. There's a reason so many of the world's top companies rely heavily on TSMC -- it's the best at what it does. Having the most technologically advanced foundries and a large customer base that often signs long-term contracts puts TSMC in a position to have consistent and reliable growth for quite some time. Trading at 28.9times trailing earningsas of this writing, TSMC stock isn't \"cheap\" by most standards, but it's less expensive than other well-known AI stocks like Nvidia andBroadcom. And in this case, it's worth paying the slight premium for this undisputed industry leader, especially if you're looking for a long-term buy-and-hold position.",

NVIDIA has 1 possible red flag we think you should know about. Find companies with promising cash flow potential yet trading below their fair value. The recent advancements in AI deployments, including NVIDIA's collaborations with CoreWeave and IREN Limited, directly bolster the company's narrative of growth through strategic partnerships and technological innovation. These partnerships are likely to enhance NVIDIA's capabilities in AI model scaling, potentially increasing revenue from data centers and AI workloads. The expected expansion into sectors like autonomous vehicles also promises new revenue streams, particularly with partnerships involving companies such as Toyota and Uber. These developments may positively influence analysts' revenue and earnings forecasts, supporting the narrative of sustained growth despite existing challenges in regulatory and export control areas. Over a five-year period, NVIDIA's total shareholder return has been very large at 1425.54%, illustrating robust long-term growth when compared to the broader market. For context, in the past year alone, NVIDIA's returns also exceeded the US Semiconductor industry, which saw a return of 17%. This substantial performance aligns with the accelerated earnings and revenue growth that analysts expect in the coming years. In terms of short-term share price movement, NVIDIA experienced a 69% rise in the last quarter, substantially outperforming the overall market rise of 2.1%. Despite this rapid increase, the current share price of US$113.54 remains below the consensus analyst price target of US$163.12, representing a 30.4% potential upside. This potential suggests that analysts see further room for growth, assuming that anticipated revenue and earnings targets are met, and operational efficiencies with new product architectures are successfully implemented.

US President Donald Trump dialed up trade tensions after Thursday\u2019s close, warning partners he may start setting levies of as much as 70% unilaterally as soon as today. With less than a week to go before the deadline, European Union carmakers and capitals were pushing for an agreement that would allow for tariff relief in return for increasing US investments, Bloomberg News reported.

The strategist advised that investors consider trimming their holdings once the index climbs beyond 6,300, a level just 0.3% above where it closed on Thursday. He also reiterated that bubble risks are mounting into the summer, especially following the House\u2019s approval of a $3.4 trillion fiscal package featuring tax cuts. \u201cOverbought markets can stay overbought as greed is harder to conquer than fear,\u201d Hartnett wrote in a note.

        "header": "Nvidia (NVDA) Nears $4 Trillion as Huang Looks Beyond Chips -- Toward Robots",
        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA,Financials)isn't just the chip king anymore; it's turning its gaze toward something even bigger humanoid robots. As the company brushed up against a $3.89 trillion market cap this week, CEO Jensen Huang took the stage in Paris and said it plainly; robotics, he believes, could become the largest industry in the world. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. That might sound ambitious; then again, so did AI a few years ago and Nvidia now dominates that space too. At the VivaTech conference, Huang introduced AEON: a full-stack humanoid robot developed with Sweden's Hexagon (HXGBY,Financials). It's not a mock-up or sci-fi concept; it's built, operational, and aiming straight for real-world deployment. Forecasts are starting to catch up. Nvidia's robotics and automotive division brought in $1.7 billion in fiscal 2024; analysts now expect that number to hit $7.55 billion by the early 2030s. If AEON gains commercial ground and it might those projections could prove too modest. Earlier this year, things looked shakier. U.S. chip export curbs to China sparked some turbulence; Nvidia stock dipped, and traders got nervous. But the pause didn't last; the stock is now up 19% for the year and once again holds the crown as the world's most valuable public company. The bigger story? That crown might soon be gilded in robotics, not just silicon. There's also seasonality working in Nvidia's favor. Historically, Q3 tends to be quiet a 4% average gain. But Q4 is where things pop; Nvidia has averaged a 23% rally in the final quarter, according to Dow Jones data. That pattern, paired with the robotics momentum, could set the stage for a breakout into even higher valuation territory. Nvidia is already in a class of its own a company that not only scaled the AI summit, but may now have the tools to build entirely new mountains. Other tech giants are maturing; Nvidia still has untouched runways. Robotics may be the next trillion-dollar catalyst and Huang knows it. As of this week, Nvidia is just $50 billion shy of Microsoft's (MSFT,Financials) all-time market cap peak. That number could fall by next week; or even tomorrow.

        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA,Financials) already stormed past a $3.9 trillion market cap this year; but according to one top Wall Street analyst,the run may be far from over. Vijay Rakesh of Mizuho Securities a 5-star-rated analyst just bumped his price target on Nvidia to $185, up from $170, while reiterating a Buy rating. That implies about 16% upside from current levels; and yes, that's after a year where the stock has already climbed 27%. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. Rakesh isn't just bullish on momentum he's leaning into product strength, long-term demand, and Nvidia's ability to outmaneuver export restrictions with new chip strategies. The analyst sees Nvidia pulling in $202 billion in revenue for FY2026, up from prior estimates; and $4.38 in earnings per share, both slightly ahead of Street consensus. He's confident the company can continue outperforming as AI workloads expand, and its flagship GB200 chips remain hot sellers into late 2025. One of the more interesting parts of the note? Rakesh pointed to Nvidia's B40 chip designed for China as a hedge in case trade rules relax. While shipments are currently blocked, he sees this as a sign Nvidia's not backing down from the market; just waiting for the door to reopen. Then there's Rubin, Nvidia's next-gen platform expected to ramp in 2026; that, combined with ongoing demand from hyperscalers, could set the stage for another growth cycle even after the monster gains seen over the last 18 months. Rakesh adjusted his valuation multiple as well; he's now applying a 32.7x multiple on FY2027 earnings, a modest bump from before but still justified, he argues, given Nvidia's sheer dominance across AI data centers, enterprise compute, and cutting-edge inference hardware.

        "content": "Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below. Chipmakers are likely to benefit from the \u2018One Big Beautiful Bill Act\u2019 passed by the Senate on Tuesday, as they will be eligible for an investment tax credit that can incentivize the semiconductor business. What Happened:According to the provisions of the tax cut bill proposed by PresidentDonald Trump,the Big Beautiful Bill aims to temporarily increase an investment tax credit for semiconductor manufacturers till the end of 2026. It would raise the tax credit to 30% of investments in manufacturing facilities, from the current 25%, providing stronger incentives for companies to expand domestic production. Trump was initially critical of the Chips and Science Act, which granted awards worth $32.5417 billion and provided loans up to $5.85 billion to 32 companies, as per theSemiconductor Industry Association. Trending: GoSun's Breakthrough Rooftop EV Charger Already Has 2,000+ Units Reserved \u2014Become an Investor in This $41.3M Clean Energy Brand Today However, Trump set up a new entity, theUnited States Investment Accelerator, within the Commerce Department, which now oversees the CHIPS Act program, as established by an executive order signed by him. The Big Beautiful Bill has now gone back to the House after narrowly passing in the Senate, before the President could finally sign it to make it into a law. These are the top chipmakers and the existing beneficiaries of the Chips Act that will benefit from this investment tax credit mentioned within the tax cut bill.
