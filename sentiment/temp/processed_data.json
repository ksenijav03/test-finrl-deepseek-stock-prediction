        "content": "We recently publishedJim Cramer Reveals His Trading Strategy For H2 2025 & Discusses These 16 Stockse. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. AI chip designer NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s importance in the AI chip industry also makes it one of Cramer\u2019s most frequently discussed stocks. Cramer continues to have faith in the company and believes CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s belief that his company will play a key role in the rollout of humanoid robots. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s shares did well in June as they closed the month 16.9% higher and enabled the firm to retake the crown of being the world\u2019s most valuable company. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s shares benefited after investors failed to determine any negative catalysts on the horizon and analysts remained bullish about the AI market\u2019s future. Cramer discussed the firm in the context of its position in the hyperscaler market: \u201cBut I would tell you David, that HPE is one of the biggest customers of NVIDIA. . . Remember, NVIDIA is regarded as somewhat of a gating point for all of the hyperscalers cause they\u2019re so expensive.\u201d A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer. Earlier, Cramer discussed NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and the negotiations between the US and China: \u201cSo, how could the president turn around these negotiations with the Chinese? Okay, so I\u2019ve been thinking about this. I always like to be constructive. I\u2019m a constructive fella\u2026 We only have one ace in our hand, and apparently, we don\u2019t want to play it, the chips from NVIDIA. Under the previous administration, NVIDIA was allowed to sell China high-quality chips, but not their best stuff, which were reserved for America and a bizarre list of 18 friendly countries. Now, the Trump administration won\u2019t even let NVIDIA sell their second or third best stuff. As CEO Jensen Huang said on our show, it\u2019s logical to presume that China won\u2019t use these chips for the military precisely because they\u2019re American chips\u2026 Still, if Trump wants to win this game, he may have to show his Trump card, NVIDIA. As I see it, the others just don\u2019t make for a good hand. You have to play with the cards you\u2019ve been dealt. And for decades, our government did everything it could to encourage outsourcing to China. They left us with a pretty lousy darn hand, both Republicans and Democrats. Between NVIDIA and Apple, Trump has a lot of leverage, but he doesn\u2019t want to use it. Those two companies seem hostage to totally different agendas inside the White House.\u201d While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

        "content": "Tesla (TSLA) shares moved back into high gear on Wednesday. The stock rose 5% to around $316 after the EV maker releaseddata on deliveries in the second quarter, which showed a sharp decline in sales from a year ago but were largely in line with analysts' expectations. The gain offset a decline of about 5% on Tuesday, when a feud between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trumpflared up again. Musk criticized the massive tax and spending bill that GOP legislators aim to approve this week, which led Trump to warn that Musk's businesses have benefitted excessively from government subsidy. Tesla shares rallied 23% in the second quarter, boosted by Musk\u2019s decision to leave his role as head of the Department of Government Efficiency tospend more time at the automaker. However, the stock has lost 22% of its value since the start of the year, weighed down by declining EV sales and concerns thatMusk\u2019s political involvement has caused damage to the Tesla brand. Below, we take a closer look at Tesla\u2019s chart and usetechnical analysisto identify price levels worth watching out for. Tesla shares broke down from a bearishflagpattern and closed below key moving averages on Tuesday before recovering most of the move Wednesday, laying the groundwork for a potentialbear trap, a trading event that lures investors to sell upon a breach of majorsupportbefore the price makes a sudden move higher. It's also worth pointing out that the50-day moving average (MA)crossed above the 200-day MA earlier this week to generate a bullishgolden cross, a chart pattern that signals higher prices. Let\u2019s identify important support andresistancelevels on Tesla\u2019s chart that investors will likely be watching. The first support level to watch sits around $285. This area may attract buying interest near the bottom of the flag pattern that sits on atrendlineconnecting a range of corresponding trading activity on the chart that extends back to last November\u2019s election-drivenstock gap. Teslabulls\u2019 failure to successfully defend this important technical level opens the door for a larger drop to $225. Investors could seekbuy-and-holdopportunities in this location near several prominent troughs that formed on the chart between early March and late April, which also closely align with a minorpeaklast August. A convincing close above the key moving averages could see the shares climb toward overhead resistance around $365. The price may encounter selling pressure in this location near a series of peaks that developed on the automaker\u2019s chart between November and May. Finally, further buying could drive a rally in Tesla shares to $430.

        "header": "5 Top Tech Stocks to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "Technology stocks have helped lead the market higher over the past several years, and with the advent ofartificial intelligence (AI), they look poised to continue to lead the way. Let's look at five top tech stocks catching the AI tailwinds that you might want to consider buying right now. When it comes to AI infrastructure,Nvidia(NVDA1.08%)has been the clear-cut winner. Itsgraphics processing units (GPUs)are being used to power the massive AI data center build-out, and its growth is showing no signs of slowing down. Last quarter, the chipmaker grew its revenue by 69% year over year to $44.1 billion, with data center sales soaring 73% to $39.1 billion. That's about a ninefold jump in data center revenue from just two years ago. Image source: Getty Images Nvidia took a huge 92% share in the GPU space in the first quarter. Its wide moat stems from itsCUDAsoftware platform. It pushed the software into universities and research labs early on, which made it the platform developers used in order to learn to program GPUs. And it has since built tools and libraries on top of CUDA to help speed up development and improve the performance of its chips. As AI infrastructure spending continues to ramp up, Nvidia is sure to benefit. Another company benefiting from the AI infrastructure build-out isAdvanced Micro Devices(AMD1.68%). Last quarter, its revenue jumped 36% year over year, while its data center business grew 57%. While a distant No. 2 to Nvidia in GPUs, the company has established itself as a leader incentral processing units (CPUs)for data centers. However, its biggest opportunity is withAI inference. It's less technically demanding than AI model training, which reduces some of CUDA's advantages. This has allowed AMD to carve a niche in inference, a market that is eventually expected to become much larger than the one for training. As the leader in the CPU market and with a big inference opportunity, AMD is in a strong position. It doesn't need to take a huge share away from Nvidia; just small gains in market share will go a long way. Meta Platforms(META-0.75%)is becoming a digital marketing AI leader. It has created a proprietary AI model called Llama to boost user engagement. At the same time, advertisers are using it to create more effective ad campaigns and to better target users. This is leading to more ad inventory and higher ad prices. In the most recent quarter, Meta's ad impressions rose 5%, while ad prices jumped 10%. Its biggest opportunity, though, is in bringing ads to its newer platforms. It just began serving ads on its popular messaging platform WhatsApp, which has over 3 billion users. It has built out the user base of its newest social media source, Threads, to 350 million monthly users, and is just gradually introducing ads to the platform. Meta's leadership in digital advertising, combined with its AI investments and new platform expansion, sets it up for solid growth in the coming years. Despite some investor concerns over AI's potential to disrupt its search business,Alphabet(GOOGL0.26%)(GOOG1.61%)remains well-positioned. While search and AI continue to evolve, Google has two big advantages. The first is distribution: Its Android smartphone operating systems, Chrome browser, andApplerevenue-sharing agreement, make it the default search engine on most devices. And it has spent decades building out one of the most far-reaching ad networks in the world, which allows it to serve everything from global brands to local service providers. At the same time, the company has become acloud computingleader. Last quarter, Google Cloud saw its revenue jump 28%, as customers used its platform to build their own AI models and tools. Investors also shouldn't ignore the company's custom AI chips, called Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). Google Cloud is using them internally to improve performance and save costs, but news recently surfaced that OpenAI is renting the chips to help power ChatGPT. The company's robotaxi business, Waymo, also has strong long-term potential. It has seen strong early demand and is now expanding into other U.S. cities. With AI, cloud computing, and robotaxis, Alphabet remains a cutting-edge technology company. Pinterest(PINS0.34%)has leaned heavily into AI and making its platform more shoppable in recent years. These investments are starting to pay off with user engagement rising and average revenue per user (ARPU) increasing. A partnership with Google, meanwhile, has helped Pinterest better monetize its huge international user base. Now, the company is looking toward its new ad tool, Performance+, to help drive growth. It combines AI and automation to let advertisers quickly create and manage ad campaigns, while automatically handling ad targeting and bidding. With its platform improvements and Performance+, Pinterest could see strong future growth.",

        "header": "Will Nvidia Beat the S&P 500 for the Third Consecutive Year After Gaining 819% in the Prior 2 Years?",
        "content": "Nvidia(NVDA1.08%)has more than recovered from a brutal sell-off in April. At the time of this writing, Nvidia is up 17.5% year to date compared to a 5% gain in theS&P 500-- putting the chip giant on track to outperform the benchmark index for the third consecutive year after gaining over 819% in 2023-2024. There are plenty of reasons to believe Nvidia can continue being a winning investment for years to come. If you were to go back in time five or 10 years and ask investors what the most valuable company would be entering the second half of 2025 -- most folks probably would have saidApple,Microsoft,Amazon, orAlphabet. All four of those companies produced excellent returns over that period -- but none compare to Nvidia -- which is now the most valuable company in the world and is within striking distance of becoming the first $4 trillion company. Here's why thegrowth stockis a buy now, but why Nvidia is unlikely to generate explosive gains going forward. Image source: Getty Images. Nvidia gets a lot of attention for its outsize stock performance. At first glance, the surging stock price looks like a bubble full of hot air and euphoria. But what's so unique about Nvidia is that its stock price actually mirrors the company's performance. In just a few years, Nvidia has gone from inconsistently profitable to a high-margin cash cow. Notice how Nvidia (the pink line) went from having very little net income to becoming one of the most profitable companies in the world.  Data byYCharts. As you can see in the above chart, Nvidia is fifth behind Alphabet, Apple, Microsoft, andBerkshire Hathawayin terms of trailing-12-month net income. Nvidia's secret sauce isn't sales -- it's high margins. Here's that same list of companies, but ranked in order of profit margins.  Data byYCharts. Nvidia is converting over half of its sales into net income -- which is incredible for a company that designs a physical product rather than selling software or operating a digital ecosystem. Companies with capital-light business models and high margins deserve premium valuations because they don't need to invest a lot of money to make money. Nvidia outsources its chip manufacturing to partners likeTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, similar to how Apple doesn't manufacture most of its products. However, the key difference is that Nvidia mainly sells to businesses, whereas Apple sells to consumers. Nvidia's key customers are hyperscalers -- the other big tech companies that demand power forcloud computing, to run artificial intelligence (AI) models, and more. Despite trade tensions and tariff pressures, many of these companies showedno signs of reducing capital expenditures-- a vote of confidence that they aretaking a long-term approach to AI. With sales pouring in for its high-margin chips, Nvidia can fuel its research and development budget for its next generation of products and take risks without straining its cash flow. As long as this virtuous cycle continues, Nvidia will likely be able to continue outperforming the S&P 500. In addition to having high margins, Nvidia also has an impeccable balance sheet that allows it to aggressively invest in innovation without impacting its financial health. The company exited its most recent quarter with $53.69 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities and just $8.46 billion in long-term debt. Having a strong balance sheet and high margins means that Nvidia can afford to take risks without needing every bet to pay off. Despite these advantages, Nvidia does have some challenges that could impact the stock going forward. Competition is heating up as other companies try to eat into Nvidia's dominant market share. For example,Broadcomis seeingphenomenal demandfrom hyperscale customers for its AI chips. Nvidia is also vulnerable to geopolitical risk, both in terms of manufacturing and selling its chips. When trade tensions were heating up in April, Nvidia said that it could take a $5.5 billion charge directly related to tariffs and trade restrictions with China if tariffs persisted. Another risk is the investment cycle. Nvidia's key customers are spending a lot on chips right now because we are still in the early innings of AI investments. Some customers may take their foot off the gas as the market matures, impacting Nvidia's growth rate. Finally, there's the law of large numbers. It was much easier for Nvidia to compound when it went from single-digit billions to tens of billions in net income per year. But the larger the company gets, the harder it will be to grow profits at a breakneck rate. Hyperscalers are spending on AI, but they need to see these investments pay off to boost their budgets and, in turn, order volumes from Nvidia. To be fair, a growth slowdown is already projected in analyst consensus estimates, which call for $4.29 in fiscal 2026 earnings per share (EPS)\u00a0and $5.76 in fiscal 2027. But even if Nvidia's growth slows to around 30% per year, the stock is arguably still a great value. At $157.75 per share at the time of this writing, Nvidia would have a 36.8price-to-earnings (P/E) ratiobased on fiscal 2026 EPS estimates (and if the stock price remained flat) and a 27.4 P/E based on fiscal 2027 estimates. Nvidia makes incredibly complicated, cutting-edge products. But its investment thesis is beautifully simple. Nvidia's earnings growth can justify a higher stock price as long as its customers keep paying top dollar for its chips and other solutions. However, investors should be on the lookout for potential spending pullbacks from key customers or margin erosion from competition. So far, there have been very few signs that indicate Nvidia's investment thesis is weakening.",

        "header": "\"Magnificent Seven\" Makeover: Which Stocks Have Earned a Spot, and Which Haven't?",
        "content": "The so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks --Alphabet,Apple(AAPL-0.09%),Amazon,Meta Platforms,Microsoft,Nvidia, andTesla(TSLA0.19%)-- provided much of the driving force behind the market's strong growth over the past several years. However, these tech stocks are seeing some uneven performance in 2025, and it may be time for this informal group -- first labeled by aBank of Americaanalyst in 2023 -- to get a makeover. I think it's time to give Apple and Tesla the boot and replace them withPalantir Technologies(PLTR1.05%)andBroadcom(AVGO1.98%). Here's why it should be out with the old and in with the new when it comes to the Magnificent Seven. Image source: Getty Images Both Apple and Tesla stocks have had poor starts to 2025. The reason for Apple's share price underperformance is that its revenue growth has slowed to a glacial pace, and investors' hopes for a strong smartphone upgrade cycle driven by itsartificial intelligence (AI)offerings have faded. In fact, Apple's revenue of $391 billion for its fiscal 2024 (which ended in September) was less than the $394.3 billion it generated in its fiscal 2022. Through the first half of fiscal 2025, its revenue is up 4% year over year, but that is still a slow pace. A big part of Apple's issues is that it has not innovated. It has had no new breakout products in the last several years, and the company is behind in AI. While Apple dedicated a lot of resources to AI, it has thus far very little to show for it. Apple Intelligence's introduction did little to convince most users to upgrade their iPhones, and it hasn't even launched Apple Intelligence in China yet. The Chinese market, meanwhile, remains a consistent weak spot for the company. Apple is losing smartphone market share to local rivals, and its revenue in the country has been on the decline. Xiaomi and Huawei have both launched smartphones to compete at the high-end of the market, and Apple has been forced to roll out sales incentives in China to try to spur demand. For a company that built its reputation not just as a technology company but as a luxury brand, that's a difficult path to go down. Apple has been generating solid growth in its high-margin services business, but it faces a unique risk: It is possible that regulators and the courts may force Alphabet to end the deal that makes Google the default search engine on Apple devices. Alphabet currently pays Apple an estimated $20 billion a year for that privileged positioning, which is pure profit for Apple. Any change to the deal could result in a big hit to its earnings. Tesla, meanwhile, has its own problems. Itselectronic vehicle (EV)deliveries and revenue fell last year, and it looks like things are getting worse. In the first quarter, its EV deliveries sank by 13% while auto revenue dropped by 20%. In the second quarter, EV deliveries fell an even worse 14%. Increased competition (especially in China) and the rising popularity of hybrid vehicles have played roles in Tesla's struggles, but some of the blame can also be pinned directly on the actions of CEO Elon Musk. Musk's support and financial backing of President Donald Trump and various Republicans in recent elections, and the subsequent leadership role he took on at Trump's \"Department of Government Efficiency\" (DOGE) have angered a lot of current and potential vehicle buyers. The constituencies Musk angered have political views that generally make them more likely to buy EVs than the demographic that supports President Trump. Musk's political actions led to protests and boycotts of Tesla in the U.S. and in several European countries where Tesla operates. More recently, Musk has become an outspoken critic of Trump's legislative efforts, irritating the president and his supporters. Musk even went so far as to threaten to start his own political party, potentially alienating all sides of the political spectrum. Not surprisingly, Tesla sales have been sinking in the U.S., Europe, and China. Tesla bulls are still betting that its robotaxi business will be a game changer. However, the recent pilot launch of the service in its first city has been met with skepticism and some well-documented potential safety issues. Meanwhile, Alphabet's Waymo has established the early lead in the driverless ride-sharing race. In my opinion, two of the best stocks to replace Apple and Tesla in the Magnificent Seven would be Palantir and Broadcom, both of which have had strong starts to the year. Palantir has become a growth machine. In Q1, it recorded its seventh straight quarter of accelerating revenue growth, with its top line climbing by 39% year over year. The greatest contributor to that growth was its largest customer -- the U.S. government. Revenue from federal government sources grew by 45% year over year (or about $116 million) to $373 million. Its sales to U.S. commercial customers grew at an even faster rate, but from a smaller base. They climbed by 71% (or about $106 million) to $255 million. Meanwhile, it recently landed a significant contract with NATO, showing that international defense has the potential to become a third meaningful growth pillar for the company. Much of Palantir's success stems from its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), which it is positioning to be an AI operating system for its clients. AIP gathers data from various sources and puts it into an \"ontology\" that connects digital assets with their real-world counterparts, allowing organizations to use AI to help solve their real-world problems. The platform is already being used by clients across a wide swath of industries to manage an array of different issues, and the opportunities for it appear to be huge. Meanwhile, Palantir recently introduced new agentic AI tools that not only suggest actions but can also carry them out. Broadcom has also been seeing solid growth. Last quarter, its revenue climbed 20% year over year while adjusted earnings per share (EPS) soared 44%. The growth is being led by its AI networking portfolio, where it provides networking components such as Ethernet switches, optical receivers, DSPs, and NICs -- critical hardware for moving huge amounts of data across AI clusters. Last quarter, its AI networking revenue surged 70%. However, Broadcom's biggest opportunity lies in custom AI chips. The company helps customers design application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) that can be used to power AI workloads. After its success in helping Alphabet design its tensor processing units (TPUs), Broadcom has been gaining more and more new custom AI chip customers. Three of its hyperscaler customers are well advanced in the ASIC design process, and Broadcom has stated that each one of them intends to deploy fabrics of 1 million AI chip clusters in 2027, representing a total serviceable opportunity for the company of $60 billion to $90 billion in that year alone. That's a huge opportunity, and it doesn't even include Broadcom's newer customers, such as Apple. Given the growth opportunities ahead for both Broadcom and Palantir, they look today like better candidates than Apple or Tesla to form a new and improved Magnificent Seven.",

Companies are sticking to their plan to spend a record amount on data centers, which are primarily used to power the ever-growing AI workloads. There are several beneficiaries of this trend, but three of my favorites areNvidia(NVDA1.08%),Broadcom(AVGO0.66%), andTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(TSM0.22%). These stocks aren't new; they've been top AI stocks to buy for several years now. However, there's still plenty of growth left in the pipeline for these stocks to continue succeeding throughout the rest of 2025 and beyond. As a result, I believe these three are excellent stocks to consider purchasing right now. Image source: Getty Images. Nvidia'sgraphics processing units (GPUs)have trained and powered the vast majority of AI models to this point for a reason. The software supporting its GPUs and the GPU technology is second to none and has contributed to Nvidia achieving around a 90% market share in the data center GPU market. Nvidia also envisions a future of AI factories filled with its GPUs, which means there is still a huge upside in the stock, despite it already being one of the most successful stocks of the past decade. Despite its success, the stock isn'tthatexpensive. It trades at 37 times forward earnings, but for most of the second half of last year, it traded at around 45 times forward earnings. This means there could still be quite a bit of juice left to squeeze out of Nvidia's stock over the next few months.  NVDA PE Ratio (Forward)data byYCharts Nvidia is not only a solid buy now, but also an excellent long-term investment. One company that's coming for Nvidia's market-share dominance is Broadcom. While it offers connectivity switches that are critical for data centers that integrate with Nvidia GPUs, Broadcom is also a partner in designing custom AI accelerators, which it calls XPUs. XPUs can outperform GPUs when the task is set up properly, as they are specifically designed to handle a particular workload. Furthermore, using a chip designed in collaboration with Broadcom eliminates Nvidia and its substantial margins, making the price of using these devices more affordable than an Nvidia GPU. Broadcom already has significant contracts to produce units like Google's Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). As more companies start to deploy AI and build up their inference capacity, Broadcom's XPUs could become a significant part of that solution, potentially driving growth in this portion of its business. Broadcom expects this division to produce between $60 billion and $90 billion in revenue by fiscal year 2027. Considering that AI revenue was $12.2 billion in FY 2024, this would be massive growth, making Broadcom an excellent stock to buy and hold. Neither Broadcom nor Nvidia has the capability to fabricate its own chips, so they outsource that work to the worldwide leader in chip production: Taiwan Semiconductor. Known as TSMC, the company has industry-leading technology and best-in-class yields, making it a great partner, which is why nearly every major tech company sources its chips from TSMC. It's also taking steps to expand its footprint in the U.S., investing $165 billion in its Arizona production facility. With companies like Nvidia touting that its highest-end Blackwell chips will be completely made in the U.S. by the end of the year, the fear surrounding TSMC's proximity to China is diminished. Management also has unparalleled access to industry trends because chip orders are often placed years in advance. Over the next five years, management anticipates revenue growth at a nearly 20% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR). That's impressive growth for multiple years, making TSMC atop stock to buy now and hold for the long term.",

        "header": "Lutnick Nears Crunch Time to Deliver on His Trade-Deal Swagger",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- With President Donald Trump\u2019s budget megabill all but wrapped up and the Iran crisis subsiding, trade wars are back center-stage in Washington \u2014 putting Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick where he\u2019s happiest: in the thick of the action. Most Read from Bloomberg NYC Commutes Resume After Midtown Bus Terminal Crash Chaos Struggling Downtowns Are Looking to Lure New Crowds Massachusetts to Follow NYC in Making Landlords Pay Broker Fees What Gothenburg Got Out of Congestion Pricing California Exempts Building Projects From Environmental Law It also piles pressure on the billionaire former Cantor Fitzgerald boss, a longtime Trump friend. He\u2019s among the top officials tasked with landing a slew of trade deals before the president\u2019s July 9 deadline. Only two framework agreements \u2014 with the UK and China \u2014 have been signed so far. Trump on Wednesday announced a new one with Vietnam, which Lutnick hailed as a \u201cmassive win for America\u2019s businesses, manufacturers, and farmers.\u201d The Commerce chief has been projecting extreme confidence as the clock counts down. \u201cWe\u2019re going to announce a whole bunch of deals over the next week or so,\u201d he told Bloomberg Television on June 26. Along with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, Lutnick has been part of the triumvirate working to squeeze the concessions Trump wants out of trade partners. It hasn\u2019t all gone smoothly. The administration has issued threats then walked them back, and announced deadlines only to delay them \u2013 repeatedly upending the financial markets where Lutnick made his career. All the drama may deliver limited results at this stage, many analysts reckon, as the rush to declare wins by July 9 pushes Trump\u2019s team to settle for skeleton deals that need fleshing out later. For the 63-year-old Lutnick, this type of high-stakes global dealmaking is why he gave up Wall Street for Washington. Since coming to DC, he\u2019s consistently tried to stay at the heart of things \u2014 embracing his role as Commerce secretary and presidential buddy, while also dipping into policies such as Trump\u2019s tax bill and echoing his boss\u2019s Fed-bashing. Above all, Lutnick\u2019s role has been defined by his proximity to Trump. Early in the term, Lutnick was such a ubiquitous presence in the West Wing that he often hung around outside the Oval Office waiting for the president to invite him into meetings, according to a person familiar with the administration. Another person familiar with the matter said Lutnick enjoys one of the closest relationships to the president among the Cabinet secretaries, and is frequently with Trump because the president wants him there. In public, the Commerce chief exudes swagger \u2013 much like Trump. Lutnick told the \u201cAll-In\u201d podcast that when he was 30 he got to know the president. They would go out together and \u201cchased the same girls,\u201d he said. Close Proximity It\u2019s a very different style from his counterpart in Trump\u2019s first term, the understated Wilbur Ross, who worked on the previous China trade deal. Ross, in an interview, described Lutnick as a quick study and hard worker. \u201cThe other night, we started a phone call at about eight o\u2019clock at night and he got interrupted by one of the foreign trade ministers calling him, so his day is probably even longer than mine was,\u201d Ross said. When it comes to policy, Lutnick\u2019s approach so far could be described as ideologically flexible. He initially aligned with Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro to back the aggressive rollout of tariffs \u2013 a move that didn\u2019t go down well on on Lutnick\u2019s old Wall Street stomping ground. Subsequently he joined Bessent and supported a pause, after the so-called reciprocal tariffs roiled bond markets. Smart and aggressive, there are no political or policy lanes Lutnick won\u2019t try to occupy, one official said. At one point he wanted to run the postal service, which does not fall under his jurisdiction. Another time he suggested the Trump administration conduct a census, a timely and expensive undertaking, before the next scheduled one in 2030. He has also led the president\u2019s effort to create a \u201cgold card\u201d program that would offer residency and a path to citizenship for investors who pay $5 million. Lutnick\u2019s \u201clife story and immense private sector success make him an invaluable addition to President Trump\u2019s trade and economic team,\u201d White House spokesman Kush Desai said. \u201cSecretary Lutnick has been a consistent champion of President Trump\u2019s America First agenda, and his pivotal role negotiating a historic UK trade agreement in mere weeks proves that he\u2019s delivering for the American people.\u201d His management of the trade portfolio has drawn mixed reviews. People from other nations who\u2019ve been involved in the talks described Lutnick as a sharp thinker and an aggressive advocate for Trump, but said he\u2019s still adjusting to trade diplomacy. They also said that having three top US officials engaged on trade can be confusing for the nations on the other side of negotiations. Back home, some lawmakers have complained about the trade-war strategy and the havoc it\u2019s sown in the financial markets and for small businesses. On Capitol Hill last month, lawmakers gave him a rough ride on everything from tariffs to regional weather service stations to lobster fishing. Business chiefs who\u2019ve met with Lutnick on trade policy have been left disappointed by the way he spouted MAGA talking points, according to two executives familiar with the conversations. The Commerce chief, like Cabinet peers, has made it a top priority to go on TV and praise Trump \u2013 though the interviews have at times gotten him into trouble, on trade and other topics. Trying to explain how tariffs would help bring manufacturing back to the US, Lutnick cited an example close to Trump\u2019s heart: production of Apple Inc.\u2019s iPhone. But his comments to CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d \u2013 invoking \u201cthe army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little screws to make iPhones\u201d \u2013 were derided by critics as overly simplistic. Ethics groups also slammed Lutnick for telling Americans, in a TV interview, to buy Tesla Inc. stock after the price had dropped. On a podcast, he argued that only \u201cfraudsters\u201d would complain if they didn\u2019t get their Social Security checks. \u2018Lights On\u2019 In his early days at Commerce, a sprawling agency with responsibilities from export controls to fisheries, there was chatter that Lutnick wasn\u2019t always a visible presence there \u2013 because he was spending so much time with Trump. His allies say that\u2019s changed, though they acknowledge that Lutnick wants to be both full-time at the department and available to the president. At a recent congressional hearing, Lutnick assured lawmakers he was working round the clock. \u201cIf you drive by the Department of Commerce late at night, you\u2019re going to see our lights on,\u201d he declared. Long hours are nothing unusual on Wall Street, where Lutnick spent four decades. He joined Cantor Fitzgerald in 1983 and worked his way up to serve as chairman and chief executive. He presided over a rebuild of the firm after 658 employees \u2014 including his younger brother \u2014 were killed in the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001. Despite being one of the longest-tenured chiefs on Wall Street, Lutnick was never viewed as in the inner circle of polished institutional titans. He positioned Cantor as a scrappy outsider, calling it the \u201cbiggest little guy\u201d in finance, and wasn\u2019t afraid of public fights with other firms or even his own employees. Lutnick entered the Trump team\u2019s inner circle during the 2024 campaign. He was one of the first Wall Street types to hold a fundraiser for Trump \u2014 in March 2024, when most financiers had been trying to prop up other Republican candidates. During the election\u2019s final stretch he traveled on Trump\u2019s plane and was a cheerleader at the closing rallies. After Trump won, Lutnick parlayed that support into a role as the person initially in charge of hiring administration personnel, and set up shop at Mar-a-Lago. But he alienated many Trump allies \u2014 and even annoyed the president himself \u2014 by putting his own hat into the ring for Treasury secretary. Lutnick and Bessent waged a multi-day public battle, with the former earning support from Elon Musk and the latter from Steve Bannon and chief of staff Susie Wiles, among others. Eventually Trump picked Bessent for the top economic job, and Lutnick as Commerce chief. Since joining the administration, Lutnick \u2014 who reported assets worth at least $806 million during the confirmation process \u2014 has transferred ownership of Cantor to his children and sold stakes in other finance businesses, cashing out hundreds of millions of dollars. Meanwhile he\u2019s been in the real estate market as a buyer \u2013 acquiring a palatial house in northwest DC, formerly owned by Fox News anchor Bret Baier, for $25 million. Public records show it\u2019s the most expensive home sale in the city\u2019s history. --With assistance from Jennifer Epstein.

This post was written by Lauren Pokedoff Welcome to Stocks and Translation, Yahoo Finance's video podcast that cuts through the market mayhem, the noisy numbers, and the hyperbole to give you the information you need to make the right trade for your portfolio. I'm your host, Alec Canal in for Jared Blickery, and with me today is the lovely Sydney Freed, AKA the voice of the people. Kindly like, subscribe, and comment on stocks and translation on Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon, or YouTube.And to kick things off today, our word and focus of the day is tech. What is going on with the rise of AI and how should you position your portfolio? And this episode is brought to you by the number 7 in honor of what else, the mag 7. So to get into all of this today, we're welcoming in Zor Capital portfolio manager Joe Fahmy. Welcome to the show, Joe. I mean, there's so much.Talk about great day too. We are trading at or near record highs. What's your bird's eye view of what's going on in markets right now? Um, I feel that we're in a bull market that started late 2022, 2023, and it's driven by AI. So I'm kind of a historian geek and I've just studied history.Throughout history, bull markets are fueled by inventions and innovations that revolutionize our lives. So you go back to the twenties railroads that got us from New York to LA faster than walking there. So whether it's uh airlines, whether it's television, um, internet, just, you know, the smartphones, um, all of them, what they all have in common is increasing productivity. So AI is the new invention innovation.That's leading this bull market because it's obviously increasing productivity and I think this can go on for another couple of years. Butif we're at or near record highs and it's like all about AI, how do you actually make money in the market because I I know like it could go up a lot, but I thought you're supposed to buy when the markets are down. So when everything is, you know, golden, how do you like make more money than the next person? Well, hopefully that you justan opportunity with the tariff scare to get in a little bit lower and hopefully people have been in for a while. But one thing I've learned from, um, almost 30 years of doing this, I'm 108 years old and in case you're wondering. What's your skin a day over 85. Thank you. Um, one thing I've learned from doing this for a while is moves in the market go on way longer than we can expect. So in other words, just when you think things can't go higher, they usually do and justWhen you have nasty bear market corrections, just when you think they can't go lower, they usually do. So my point is, I'm not afraid to buy a little bit at at highs. And I'mcurious too. I've been speaking with some analysts about this. Do you think heading into this year, we had maybe a positioning problem where people thought they were too overexposed to tech, so they were moving to defensive plays, they had a lot of cash on the sidelines, and that's part of the reason why we're seeing this move higher in the tech trade. Yeah, and, and also the tariffs, look, the headline scared a lot of people. There are a lot of, if you look at the statistics, a lot of institutions are underinvested right now. That's why when you have the Iran scare over the weekend, everyone's like, oh, the market's gonna crash, but beneath the surface institutions have to get in when things are are dropping. So there are a lot of institutions right now that are offsides, and I think that's what's keeping this underlying.Resilient bid to the markets. And I'm curious too if history is any indication, we look back at 2022, right, where the recession that was supposed to happen never came. So our markets may be thinking, well, if the market's going to continue to be resilient, the economy can withstand all these changes, maybe we just stay and see what happens because right now the hard data is pretty solid. Yeah, the data is great. I always say if you're worried about a recession, just leave your house. I mean, just look around. You can't get into some restaurants. The airports are busy. I look at booking, which is the old price line. It's an indicator of travel, not just airfare and hotels, but cruise lines, all this. If that's near a new high, that's a sign to me that things are OK. Now, of course, you're gonna have scares.Along the way and slowdowns along the way, but overall the economy is still strong. What do you like in the tech right now? Are there specific names, you have for people? Um, I mean, I'm, I do like a lot of the AI plays that, uh, we recently had a growth scare, but Microsoft and Meta's recent earnings, they said nope, full steam ahead.We're still spending money and you know capex expenditure. They're still putting a lot of money into AI so it's not just AI, but I'm noticing some space names with a lot of the great themes, but that's like another 2-3 years down the road. Some retail, not just, um, apparel, but restaurants I've seen like Texas Roadhouse and Shake Shack and Dutch Brothers some of these are near new highs, so.There's not just that, but energy as as well as a play off of the, the demand for the energy grid for AI and data centers. So there's a lot of sectors. And you're alluding to the fact that we've seen this broadening out of this market and within tech in particular, we always talk about Nvidia. We're trading your records. Do you think this is still an undervalued stock at these levels? Well, I think it's made a big move and it made, you know, call it fromSlit adjusted whatever 10 to 140 and and when stocks and the markets make big moves they kind of need to digest a little bit just like after a big Thanksgiving meal you kind of need to lay sideways on the couch for a little while, sometimes longer, but my point is it made a big move. It gets to be overcrowded and a year ago June it was 140 something and now it's you know, just cracking through 140, 150. So it made a big move. It's consolidating and I still think.It still has more upside. So you recommend buying because I'm, I'm always curious like for people who are more passive investors buying the actual stock is the way to go or simply investing in an ETF, a chip ETF or just something to the, what do you think? It depends on your personal preference. It's always, I always say do what works for you.Well don't want single stock risks, so SMH is one of the main semi- ETFs. 21% of it's Nvidia, and then you get 10% broadcom and um Taiwan semi. So that gives you great exposure to that trade. If you don't want single stock risk, then use an ETF or the cus for like as you alluded to, or if you want single stock risk, you can, you can take a long, you know.I always just say manage risks. So even though I might be bullish and optimistic on things, when things, you know, turn against you, you have to always have some sort of a risk management, uh, in, in place. And if Jared was here, he would tell you I sit next to him and I ask him every day, is now a good time to buy a video? What are the technicals showing you? Because it's one of those trades where you do have FOMO if you're not in the market and you talked about the AI productivity boom. Do you think that's being underpriced at the current moment? I think that there are people way smarter than me, and I know that's a large sample size, but there are people way smarter than me saying that this is bigger than the internet. Um, like Mark Andreessen, for example, in 2010 or 2011, he wrote a piece called Why Software's Eating the World and he was dead right.And now he wrote a piece a couple of years ago about AI how it's gonna change our lives and there's so many smart venture capitalists and smart minds that are talking about this is going to be like there's still a long ways down the road so I think that's it's uh.There's still a lot left to this move. I'm curious as a portfolio manager how you find the next big stock. I know that's like, that's what everyone wants to know. And if we all knew it, we'd all be rich, but like, what is the next Nvidia or what are the indicators that you look for in a stock similar, so in the chip space that makes you think that's going to be the next breakout star. Question, I, I study, as I said, I'm kind of a market nerd where historically what causes a stock to go up is earnings and sales growth. It's almost like a simple concept, but people don't for you people forget like if you are growing your business, you start a small business and you go from a million in sales to 10 million in sales. Guess what? your small business is worth more. So it's the same concept. So if a company historically they looked at McDonald.McDonald's before as McDonald's and Microsoft and Home Depot and what caused all of these huge moves was earnings and sales growth. So I'm looking for something now that has very, very strong earnings and sales growth because as long as the markets cooperating for the most part, that'll help their stock appreciate. And we need strong fundamentals in the economy in order to support that earnings growth. So from your clients, what arebiggest concerns, do they talk to you a lot about the tariff uncertainties, inflation uncertainties? Do they have a lot of excess cash on the sidelines that they're waiting to deploy until later this summer when potentially we can get a little bit more clarity on the state of the economy? Yeah, some people, I mean, look, I, I keep the news on because you need to know what's going on in the world, but it's a lot of its fear and it's not that I'm complacent. I just try to encourage them, think, you know, with some of these names longer term, you're gonna have corrections along the way, butAs I always say, you don't turn on the Weather Channel when it's 75 and sunny outside. You turn it on when a blizzard or tornado or hurricanes coming. So my point is the news is designed for the most part to scare us for ratings. So I take it all with a grain of salt. How do you then know when a news headline hits an event happens and you need to adjust your portfolio versus ignore? Well, we saw that with the Middle East, right? We have this reaction and then stocks stocks closed in the green on Monday. That's the line. It's not the news, it's the market's reaction to the news. So when things really started to break down in 2020 where we weren't sure if COVID was gonna be a big deal if it's gonna spread where when it really starts to break down, that's the market's reaction to the news when it breaks certain technicals where the institutions normally support and they're like we're getting out of it.That's when you have to heed the warning there. But in the case of the recent Middle East crisis so far, the news has been miserable, but the market's resilient. So that's an example of the market's holding support. So how do youtrain your mind then to be that investor that doesn't get scared, that stays in it when it's tough, because the mental toughness element of it is scary, the tips.Yes. If you're a trader, you, you have, I don't know, you have a few choices. You turn off the news except for you guys because you can keep you guys that'sactually a thing right now that people are talking about that you're better off not looking at the news and just staying, yeah, or to use your expression mental toughness. That's another option is say, OK, I can keep social media on, I can keep the news on and and take it all with a grain of salt.Or your other option is bla blame your parents for raising a wimp. I've seen a lot ofaggressive dip, especially on the part of retail traders that when the market goes down to view it as more of an opportunity rather than a scary moment where you're going to be losing a lot of money and not focus on the red in your line. The market's the only place where when things go on sale, people run, otherwise people usually go for sales and stuff. It just all depends on your time frame. Um, with the indexes and the ETFs over every 1020, 30 year period, they go up. They're designed to go up because they take out the weaker stocks and put in the stronger ones. But with individual stocks, you do have to be a little bit more careful because.They don't always come back. So it just depends on your time frame and, you know, your strategy. This might be an odd thing to ask, but are there any pullbacks you are anticipating in the next few months, any events that investors should watch out for that could cause a pullback? Iwouldn't be surprised this summer to see a pullback. August and September again, being a historian, August and September traditionally two of the weaker months of the year. So a lot of people go away. Hampton's all.That stuff. So you, you tend to see a lot of institutions might might sell and just take some time off in the summer. I mean, we have Jackson Hole in August, maybe have a cut in September. How much of a catalyst, it's the you're asking are awesome. I know it's just impossible to answer because if you tell someone whose dollar cost averaging an ETFs.Years it doesn't matter, but if someone's actively managing a portfolio and things have been strong over the past month or two, then maybe going into July you could take a little bit off the table. But again, it's just all it's just a case by casebasis. When we saw the uh May go away that didn't really that didn't work out too well, but Joe, let's take it right there. We will need to take a short break, but we'll be right back with Joe and more stocks in translation next.Welcome back to Stocks in Translation. We're here with Capital portfolio manager Joe Fahmy, and we were just talking about how we need to evaluate different risks within this market right now, whether it be from the economy, whether it be from the Fed, and you were saying that it depends on your time horizon. So how does that differ when you're a long-term investor versus maybe when you're nearing retirement? Um, well, they say as you get closer to retirement, reduce a little bit more of your equity exposure and maybe more into fixed income, and I, it's not, you know, depends on your risk, but the good thing now is for the longest time it was, you know, 0, 0% interest rate policy. So if you, if you had.Then you retired and you had money in the bank from the financial crisis up until 2021, you might get like 7 cents interest on your money for the month, but now that you can get 4 4.5% on the 10 year and on on certain CDs in the bank, so as you get closer to retirement.You can have a little bit more in cash because at least you're getting some interest off of that. Doyou have a recommended asset allocation? I know that's broad and it differs for people with longer runways, but I don't know, let's call it an earlier investor, 20s, 30s, and then maybe a middle age, 40s,50s. I think if you're younger, all stocks, they say it's supposed to be 100. Take your age minus 100 minus your age, and that's the percentage to be in stocks as a guideline. So if you're 30, you should be 7.in stocks, but I think if you're 30 you should be 100% equities. So no bonds. I just, if you're that's, that's young, you know, so no, I, I asked because with the drawdown, I I was thinking about my own portfolio and like, do I need any hedges for volatility something like gold. Uh, I really genuinely was thinking to myself, do youneed and I'm the opposite because I feel like I have no hedges and I just.I, I, I, I don't, I don't think I have any right now. My, my, so my defensive play is gold. So my point is, do I need them? If you'rein the S&P with 11 sectors when the market drops, you're gonna have one of those sectors of utilities. So there is a defensive component to that because once I mean 500 stocks is a lot of diversification and a lot of them, most of their revenues do come internationally, so you do have international exposure. You do have.You know, some, um, you know, technically fixed income through the dividends and so forth. So again, I have, it's a little bit different where I might be positioned a little bit more as a growth manager towards being a little bit more aggressive, but.Yeah, if you're younger, I'm, I say, hey, stick with, you know, the spy or the cus longer term and you'rehedging yourself to what you were just saying. You have so much exposure to differenttypes of or I do and raise a little bit of cash at times when when I feel like, OK, it's been a good run. Nothing wrong with cashing a little bit because even though I think this market's going to go on for two or three years, it's not gonna go straight up. Even if you compare it to 95 to 99, which was an incredible boom with the internet.Um, 97, there was a uh Japanese um currency crisis and 98 was a Russian debt crisis with long term capital. And so there were scares along the way during that amazing run. So the analogy is there's going to be just recently the tariff scare was almost a 20% correction. So there's gonna be hiccups along the way. You basically answered this, but I just want to hear it again. You consider investing in all of the different sectors a level of.Diversification, right? Because when I think about that, I think stocks, bonds, gold, gold, international fixed income and all. Everyone has, you know, a traditional, um, financial advisor is going to asset allocate that for you. I'm not traditional, I guess. I don't like to blend in with everybody, so we don't want to be boring, I don't want to be boring. I mean, I think with the, they say 20 stocks is perfect diversification. So when you have 500 multinationals.that's almost over diversification, but it gives you exposure to a lot of sectors. What about FOMO chasing, chasing these buzzwords all the time and it feels like with applications like Robin Hood, retail traders, just getting into the game a little bit more. What's your perspective there? FOMO's cured with discipline. That's my perspective. So I just, it's one word acceptance. I I can't own.So look, there's gonna be some hot quantum computing names that go up to 300%. There's gonna be some hot nuclear names. I've seen them already in the markets, but.I see some of them, but you can't chase everything. You just have to say, OK, I gotta accept. I just can't own everything, and that's part of the discipline. And trust me, I learned the hard way because I used to do that, but then all of a sudden you own 50 names and you're and then the market corrects and you're like, what do I even have in my portfolio? I don't even know what these companies are. I just chased them because someone on social media was talking about them. So you, you need to have some.Yeah, the chocolate cake's gonna be there. You gotta have some discipline, you know, you have to try to control yourself once in a while. Something you in your notes, you said there's a lot of bullish activity in the major tech names, um, for options. What do you think of options forA passive investor, is that, should that be a non-existent thing? How do you even start takes out their notebook. Yeah, I'm dying to know if I need options. Well, it depends. I follow unusual options activity because a lot of the big institutions use it to um build positions and stocks and so forth.Some people, uh, a common strategies covered calls where you own the stock and you write, if you think like I gave the example of Nvidia makes a big run and it's been consolidating or even Tesla made a big run in consolidating. Some people write covered calls against that. That's just something I would either look into and I don't wanna say it's dangerous, but it, it involves risk like everything so you have to.Educate yourself on it, but you useit as an indicator of what some of the bigger institutions are doing. Ifollow what they're doing because whether it's someone like a Bill Ackman or even Carl Icahn when he got into his Netflix position, he, they do it all through options, big blocks of options in the money options. Some of the activist investors do that as well, so.I, because liquidity is an issue, so if you want to buy 200,000 or a million shares, you could just buy 2000 contracts and then and then they automatically execute that for you. So I like to trav to watch what they're trafficking in because it gives clues. That's smart.That's smart, and I wanna switch gears to a segment we like to call Lost.Translation. And this is what the market may be misunderstanding, and I want you to explain why the Netscape web browser release is similar or different from the chat GPTrelease. So that's the comparison I'm using is that this bull market that let's say it's going to be 2023 to hopefully 2027 or longer is similar to the internet, uh, 95 to 99, andRight around 949995. It was actually chart from Bespoke Investments, which I found very fascinating because the crack invention of the time was Netscape browser at the time and, and, and Chat GPT came out in late 2022. So,It's amazing how the NASDAQ and releases of both of those products has literally tracked almost identical. So I almost compare it to the, you know, the crazy invention of the time then and now that a lot of people are scaling up and using it. They did, they're tracking each other very similarly. Haveyou been surprised at the mass adoption of Chappy GPT at this point? Fastest application to 100 million users, 2 months, faster than.I mean, the list is endless of, you know, whether it's Facebook, Instagram, or 2 months for even TikTok faster than all of that stuff. So, uh, they're estimating maybe even a billion active users. So yeah, it is there an element of it that's a little scary? Well, you just have to say thank you at the end so it doesn't come after you and destroy your computer or your life somehow. Just be polite with with AI.I want to end on a personal note. I want to know how one becomes a portfolio manager in the first place and start studying markets. Um, I, I think everyone has a passion that they're interested in. Some people I know are amazing chefs where they just start cooking and then it just becomes a passion. It's just something, you know.I, I love the markets and as I've been putting out content and been grateful you guys have been able to let me, you know, contribute and other stuff through my blogs like I think it's just as you put out stuff if people reach out and they say, hey, we're interested we like what you're saying we're interested in you managing money and that's when I became an adviser and um so I think it's just.It's it's a different way of doing things, but if people like what you have to say and your content, then they end up reaching out and then decided to make a business out of it. So yeah, you too. Where you talking about? and it's in Vegas. I'm out there um I have a lot of clients out there so I'm I'mI do film and it's music people, but I don't want to make it all business as I was telling you earlier. I talk markets all day, which I don't mind, but I've been lucky to know some people, music, sports, um, you know, finance and so forth. So it's fascinating to me and I'm enjoying it. Is thereanything you find challenging about it? You know it is time flies when you're having fun and all that. So if it's a conversation I'm enjoying, the time flies. If it's, oh no, like.My fear would be I just don't know what to ask next. And then I look up and I'm like, how do I get through the next 45 minutes of this. So speaking of flying, unfortunately we are out of time here.

        "header": "Stock-Split Watch: Is Palantir Next?",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) stocks have soared in recent years, and though that's fantastic, when a stock reaches a particularly high level, it may have difficulty climbing even higher. That's why companies such asNvidiaandBroadcomlast year each launched a stock split, a move to bring the price of their shares down to Earth. Investors like stock splits for a couple of reasons: They make a stock more easily accessible to a broader range of investors, and they also could be viewed as a sign of confidence from the company. When looking for the next potential stock split player, investors generally consider companies that have seen their shares skyrocket. And with this, one particular player comes to mind:Palantir Technologies(PLTR1.05%). The AI software company last year soared 340% and in the first half of this year climbed more than 80%. Could this highflier be next to split its stock? Let's find out. Image source: Getty Images. Before delving into the Palantir situation, though, a quick note onhow stock splits work. These operations involve offering current holders additional shares of the particular stock, and this is done according to the ratio of the split. So in a 10-for-1 stock split, an investor who originally held one share would hold 10 shares post-split -- and that means a stock that traded for $1,000 before the split would see its price come down to $100. But, importantly, the value of that investor's entire holding -- and the market value of the company -- won't change. And neither will valuation, that metric measuring whether a stock is expensive or cheap. So a stock split is purely mechanical and doesn't change anything fundamental about a company or its stock. As a result, a stock won't jump or plummet just because a company has announced a stock split -- these operations don't act as a reason to buy or sell. But, as mentioned, they can be positive over time, as they open the investing opportunity up to more potential investors. They also show that management believes the stock has what it takes to rise again from its new lower price. Now let's talk about Palantir. The company's past doesn't offer us clues about its view on stock splits, since it's never executed such an operation. This isn't shocking, since the company, though it's 20 years old, just went public five years ago. And the stock actually stumbled through its first couple of years on the market. But it started gathering momentum in 2023, and then, as I said earlier, surged last year, even delivering the best performance in theS&P 500, an index it had recently joined. This is all thanks to soaring demand for Palantir's AI-driven software, a platform that helps customers aggregate their data and use it to improve efficiency and make game-changing decisions. In the past, Palantir generated most of its growth through contracts with the U.S. government, but in recent times, both government and commercial customers are delivering double-digit revenue increases. Why the change? Palantir had originally built high-performance data aggregation and analysis systems, but the company two years ago launched a new addition to its portfolio: Its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), an AI-driven system that helps customers, as seen in Palantir's AIP boot camps, go from zero to a use case in a matter of hours. This has appealed to both government and commercial customers, as they seek to benefit from AI as quickly as possible. As a result, Palantir has seen earnings take off and its number of commercial customers soar, from just 14 a few years ago to hundreds today. And this success has fueled extraordinary gains in the share price, pushing the stock to trade for 235 timesforward earnings estimates, a level seen as extremely expensive. Now let's get back to our question: Is Palantir ripe for a stock split? Not necessarily, and here's why. A split won't changePalantir's biggest problem: its valuation. Though it would lower the stock price, it technically wouldn't make the stock cheaper by common valuation metrics. Earnings per share is adjusted to correspond with the new number of shares post-split, and this leaves the valuation figure unchanged. Meanwhile, Palantir shares, trading at just under $140, haven't reached excessively high price points in relation to its peers. Many other tech stocks trade for several hundreds of dollars per share, so it isn't shocking to see Palantir at its current level. Of course, this could change if Palantir rises significantly in the months and quarters to come. But for now, the top AI stock probably won't be next on the stock split list.",

        "content": "There will be many winners as infrastructure is built to support the huge and increasing computing power needed for artificial intelligence (AI) applications.Nvidiacontinues to pave the way and has already been a huge beneficiary thanks to its leading advanced chips, software, and engagement with developers. Nvidia's revenue has soared from what was then a record $61 billion in fiscal 2024 to more than $130 billion in its fiscal year 2025, ended Jan. 26. That growth continues as sales in the first half of fiscal 2026 are expected to be approximately $90 billion. It's all about the company's data center segment, as companies -- as well as sovereign nations -- quickly invest in infrastructure to expand AI capabilities. That infrastructure includes servers and cooling systems that are provided byDell Technologies(DELL0.41%). The company's revenue has also been soaring, and it is well positioned to ride AI's \"golden wave\" along with Nvidia. Image source: Getty Images. Dell isn't apure-play AI stock, but it has already seen benefits from the AI revolution. Revenue hasn't soared quite as much as it has for Nvidia, but Dell's Infrastructure Solutions Group saw sales hit a record $43.6 billion in fiscal 2025, up 29% year over year. Zoom in specifically to its AI server business, though, and the growth is more impressive. Server shipments generated nearly $10 billion, up over sixfold from $1.5 billion in fiscal year 2024. Demand continued to grow in the company's fiscal 2026 first quarter, and the period ended on May 2 with a $14.4 billion AI backlog.Chief operating officerJeff Clarke called the demand unprecedented, adding, \"We generated $12.1 billion in AI orders this quarter alone, surpassing the entirety of shipments in all of [fiscal 2025].\" That's all because of the huge data centers and AI training factories being built bylarge growth companiesas well as sovereign governments -- all of it supported by Nvidia and its powerful products.Meta Platforms,Amazon,Alphabet, andMicrosoftcollectively have plans to spend as much as $320 billion this year investing to expand AI capabilities. Another group of tech companies is partnering with ChatGPT creator OpenAI forthe Stargate Project, with another $500 billion in AI infrastructure investments planned over the next several years. OpenAI has also started a program intending to help regions outside the U.S. launch large AI projects. Dell servers will likely be part of most of this development. It's why the stock has quickly rebounded from its April lows. That growth is driving investors to Dell stock. But there are other reasons to own it, too. The company's Client Solutions personal computer segment is also integrating AI for commercial and retail clients. That segment provides a stable cash flow base and it generated more revenue than the Infrastructure Solutions group last year. Management is returning some of that cash flow to shareholders. It increased its annual dividend by 18% for thecurrent fiscal year,and its board of directors approved a $10 billion increase in itsshare repurchase authorization. The company says it is committed to returning at least 80% of its adjusted free cash flow to shareholders. It also plans toraise its dividendat least 10% annually through fiscal year 2028. That shareholder-friendly approach should make investors feel good. Yet surging demand and a large and growing backlog for its AI servers are what really make it a good time to buy Dell stock. It has more runway ahead to ride the golden wave of AI along with Nvidia.",

Top startups competing in key areas, from humanoid robots to AI search, have also seen their private market share prices surge. \"In today's VC landscape, there's a clear split between the 'haves' and the 'have-nots,'\" Emily Zheng, senior VC analyst at PitchBook, told Yahoo Finance. According to Zheng, a handful of breakout AI startups are driving the majority of valuation growth. Some are raising capital at astonishing prices while attracting intense demand from primary and secondary investors. That demand \u2014 often fueled by a mix of FOMO, conviction in AI tech, and limited liquidity options \u2014 has helped push the US VC secondary market to an estimated $60 billion in size this year, up from $50 billion in 2024, according to PitchBook. But this sharp rise doesn't mean venture is booming across the board \u2014 most of the activity is concentrated in a small, highly sought-after cohort. Among the top five private-market gainers this year, the average year-to-date share price is up a staggering 393%. Together, these startups have added over $68 billion in estimated valuation so far in 2025, perYahoo Finance data.

Backed by investors like Nvidia and Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos, the startup has seen rapid adoption. It'sreportedlyin talks to raise up to $1 billion, which could push its valuation to $18 billion. Estimated baluation: $91.59B Year founded: 2023 YTD share price: +231.33% Founded by Elon Musk, the startup xAI aims to build artificial general intelligence (AGI) that competes with large language models like ChatGPT.

        "header": "Why Is Alphabet Stock Worth Less Than Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon Even Though It Is the Most Profitable S&P 500 Company?",
        "content": "The stock market cares more about future earnings potential than the past -- and that may be whyNvidia,Microsoft,Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), andAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN)are all worth more thanAlphabet(GOOG0.31%)(GOOGL0.26%)today even though Alphabet is the onlyS&P 500stock with over $100 billion in trailing-12-month net income. Here's why the market views Alphabet's earnings differently than other megacapgrowth stocks, and whether Alphabet is a buy now. Image source: Getty Images. Earnings are one of the most important metrics investors use to value a company. How much profit a company generates is an integral part of an investment thesis. But so are expectations for future profits.  GOOGL Net Income (TTM)data byYCharts Although net income is just a number, there are nuances worth understanding. A leading company that operates in a growing industry with competitive advantages, high profit margins, and a great balance sheet will have far higher-quality earnings than a company operating in a declining or even failing industry that is cyclical and capital-intensive. This concept is why even the best oil and gas companies, likeExxonMobilandChevron, sport such inexpensive valuations. Their earnings aren't high-margin. Generating them takes a lot of capital. And oil and gas consumption may look much different decades from now than today. This doesn't mean ExxonMobil and Chevron are bad companies. In fact, both areexcellent dividend stocks. It just means investors are unlikely to pay the same price for these companies relative to their earnings as, say, an ultra-fast-growing company with high marginslike Nvidia. Alphabet doesn't have a capital-intensive business model. It generates high margins and has diverse revenue streams from its services like Google Search, Google Network, YouTube, Android, Google Cloud, and more. It also has aphenomenal balance sheetwith more cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities than debt. Despite these advantages, Alphabet sports aprice-to-earnings (P/E) ratioandforward P/E ratiothat are far lower than Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon.  NVDA PE Ratiodata byYCharts Thisdiscounted valuationis why Alphabet is worth less than its peers despite making more profit.\u00a0Alphabet's valuation is much cheaper than some of its peers because investors are less optimistic about its future earnings prospects. Nvidia is powering the future of artificial intelligence (AI) with its graphics processing units for data centers. Big tech continues to spend on AI, so investors are optimistic that demand for Nvidia's products will continue growing. Microsoft isintegrating AIinto its software and is the No. 2 player in cloud computing behind Amazon. In contrast, Alphabet's Google Cloud is adistant third in market share. Apple isn't growing quickly, but the company has such a dominant,vertically integrated ecosystemof consumer products and services that investors are willing to pay a premium price for the stock relative to its earnings. Alphabet makes the majority of its operating income from Google Search. Unlike Amazon (and arguably Microsoft), cloud is not the most valuable aspect of the company. Alphabet's AI plays mainly come from Google Cloud and its \"Other Bets\" category, which consists of projects like self-driving company Waymo and AI research lab DeepMind, which is behind the chatbot Gemini. In sum, the market may be viewing Alphabet's business model as morevulnerable to technological advancements in AIthan other megacap growth companies that are clearly benefiting from AI. There's a famous (and still relevant) quote by Warren Buffett that goes, \"You pay a very high price in the stock market for a cheery consensus.\" Companies that are favorable to many investors tend to demand expensive valuations, whereas companies with an element of uncertainty can fetch a discount. The simplest reason to buy Alphabet right now is if you believe the market's skepticism about the company's AI potential is unwarranted or overblown. In that case, investors can buy Alphabet at a steep discount to its peers. If Alphabet had a 30 P/E ratio instead of a sub-20 P/E, it would be worth well over $3 trillion. If it had Microsoft's P/E, it would be the most valuable company in the world. In many ways, Alphabet deserves to trade at a discount to these other big tech names. But maybe only by a little bit -- not the drastic discrepancy we are seeing in the market today. All told, now is a great time for value investors interested in big tech to buy Alphabet stock.",

        "header": "Prediction: This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Could Outpace Nvidia After the Next Chip Upgrade",
        "content": "Nvidia(NVDA2.62%)has been the biggest beneficiary of the tremendous demand for artificial intelligence (AI) chips. This is not surprising, as the parallel computing ability of its graphics processing units (GPUs) makes them ideal for AI model training and inference. It is worth noting that Nvidia has been running away with the data center GPU market, with an estimated market share of 92% at the end of last year. That's miles ahead of second-placeAdvanced Micro Devices'(AMD1.68%)share of just 4%. However, it won't be surprising to see AMD taking market share away from Nvidia thanks to its upcoming chips. Let's see why that may be the case. Image source: Getty Images. AMD recently unveiled its AI chip roadmap at an investor event. The chipmaker used the event to launch its MI350 series of data center GPUs, promising a \"4x generation-on-generation AI compute improvement and up to 35x leap in inferencing performance.\" This new line of chips is manufactured on a 3-nanometer (nm) process node. That gives it an advantage over Nvidia's latest generation of Blackwell processors, which are reportedly manufactured using a 4nm node. Chips manufactured using a smaller process node are theoretically more powerful and power-efficient, since they pack a higher number of transistors into a smaller area. As a result, the electrons need to travel in a smaller area to perform computing tasks, and they generate less heat. So, AMD's latest generation of AI accelerators could be better than Nvidia's offerings, at least on paper. AMD points out that its MI350 series processors have stronger specifications compared to Nvidia's Blackwell offerings, packing in 1.6 times more memory. It also points out that the MI355X processor is 1.2 times to 1.3 times faster than Nvidia's Blackwell chips while running inference models such asDeepSeek R1and Llama 3.1. More importantly, AMD is aiming to hurt Nvidia big time with its MI400 series of accelerators that are set to be launched next year. The company is going to increase the high-bandwidth memory (HBM) capacity to 432 gigabytes (GB) on the MI400 from 288GB on the MI350 series chips. What's more, AMD is going to more than double the memory bandwidth in the MI400 processors, to 19.6 terabytes per second. AMD points out that the MI400 will mark a significant leap in AI compute performance, which will be far greater than what it saw in the previous generational upgrade. Meanwhile, Nvidia's next generation of AI GPUs is expected to pack similar memory compared to the current generation Blackwell processors, which means that AMD could enjoy a spec advantage on paper. A bigger memory stack will allow AMD's chips to transfer more data, while the higher bandwidth will enable faster transmission, at least theoretically. This potential advantage could spur stronger sales of AMD's AI GPUs, helping the company capture a bigger share of the market. Now, AMD doesn't need to overtake Nvidia to supercharge its growth. It simply needs to capture a double-digit share of the AI GPU market in the next three years. Assuming AMD can capture 10% of the AI GPU market by 2028, its revenue from this segment could hit $50 billion (based on the projected $500 billion annual revenue that the AI accelerator market is expected to hit by 2028). This could be enough to help it deliver more upside than Nvidia. AMD finished 2024 with just under $26 billion in total revenue. The company says that it sold more than $5 billion worth of data center GPUs last year, which means that the non-AI data center GPU businesses contributed $21 billion. Assuming it doesn't witness any growth in the rest of its segments over the next three years (and generates $21 billion in annual revenue from its non-AI GPU business in 2028), but manages to hit $50 billion in AI GPU revenue, its annual top line could hit $71 billion after three years. The shares are currently trading at 8.4 times sales, which is almost in line with the U.S. technology sector's average sales multiple of 8.1. Assuming that AMD trades in line with the technology sector's multiple after three years, its market capitalization could hit $575 billion based on the revenue it is expected to generate in 2028. That points toward potential gains of 150% from current levels. Nvidia, on the other hand, is trading at an expensiveprice-to-sales ratioof 26. However, with the company's top-line growth rate expected to slow down over the next couple of years, it won't be surprising to see Nvidia trading at a discount. As such, the possibility of AMD delivering more gains than Nvidia thanks to its upcoming chips cannot be ruled out. That's why AMD looks like a solidAI stockto buy right now.",

        "content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) revolution is shaking Wall Street to its very foundations.The \"Magnificent Seven\" groupof market-defining AI stocks all rank among the 12 highest-valued securities on the market today. Together, this group accounts for 32.3% of theS&P 500(^GSPC0.47%)index's total score, and 61.9% of the tech-heavyNasdaq 100index. These are the market darlings of this era, all trading at lofty valuations and perhaps headed toward a painful price correction someday soon. What if you're not comfortable giving so much weight to a risky bunch of recent market beaters? Remember, past performance does not guarantee that future returns will be similar. Well-known analyst Dan Ives just launched a hand-vetted fund that provides targeted investments inthe AI boom, but with lower influence from the handful of top-ranked giants. Let's see what's different about this exchange-traded fund (ETF), so you can decide whether it belongs in your portfolio. Image source: Getty Images. TheDan Ives Wedbush AI Revolution ETF(IVES0.94%)is technically anindex fund, but the underlying index is a custom list that simply reflects the stock pick in Ives' top-30 AI stock-picking reports. It was launched just days before the related ETF. So the index formulation is just a technicality. The Wedbush analyst with a long research history and a penchant for colorful suits is really making these stock picks in a very direct sense. At the same time, the index structure adds some academic rigidity to the ETF. New additions to the index (and ETF) are given acap-basedweight between 1% and 4% of the total portfolio, no exceptions. The index is rebalanced four times a year, on the third Fridays of March, June, September, and December. The hard caps of at least 1% but no more than 4% are reapplied at each of these events, making sure that no single stock ever represents a huge slice of the Dan Ives ETF. The annual expense ratio is 0.75%, far above the leading S&P 500 index funds and comparable to many handpicked stock collections. On June 30, just 27 calendar days after the ETF's inception, the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks added up to 32.6% of the Ives fund's value. That's actually a smidge higher than their combined slice of the S&P 500, but megacapsNvidia(NVDA1.08%)andMicrosoft(MSFT0.84%)hold significantly lighter weights in the Dan Ives portfolio. Nineteen of the 30 components ran into the 4% top-end weighting cap at the latest rebalancing, making alternatives such asIBM(IBM0.47%)andAdvanced Micro Devices(AMD1.68%)just as important to the ETF's value as any of the Magnificent Seven. Image source: Getty Images. No ETF can guarantee market-beating returns, and AI is a volatile field right now. I can't guarantee that Ives' selections will outperform the broader market in the long run, or that the nearlyequal-weightednature of this fund is a better idea than the market cap weightings seen in many other ETFs. But if you're looking for a lower-risk approach to the exciting but risky AI market, the Dan Ives AI Revolution ETF might hit the spot. Its careful rebalancing policy sets this fund apart from most of its rivals. Ives' decades of market analysis experience should be worth something, too. The fund is too young to do a deep dive into its market performance, but it's off to a strong start in its first month of operation. Only time will tell how this ETF will stack up in the long run, but its lower risk profile could be right for your portfolio. After all, it will hurt less to hold the Dan Ives ETF if a top stock like Nvidia or Microsoft takes a big tumble. As always,do your own researchbefore you buy anything -- but if you want a smarter, more diversified way to play the AI revolution, this ETF might just fit the bill.",

There's also a website you can use to search called AnnualReports.com. It aggregates annual reports from more than 10,000 international companies. AI can be a valuable asset to you as an investor because of the complexity of annual reports. AI can help you automate the process of data extraction. For instance, you can easily look for financial data or company risk andidentify trendswithout having to go through numerous pages. Keep in mind that the process depends on the AI program you choose. For instance, you may need to install plugins for sites such as ChatGPT and Writingmate so you can upload PDF files for analysis.Other sites, including FinChat, AlphaSense, and Intelligize+ AI, don't require any special add-ons to help you. It can be pretty daunting going through hundreds of pages of an annual report. As an investor, use your AI tools to help you sift through the following key pieces of information. Make sure you read the 10-K's footnotes. They contain important information about the company's accounting practices, policies, and other details that may not fit into the report. Using the AI software of your choice to extract the data from Form 10-K is just one of the challenges. The other is to analyze the information and apply it to yourinvestment strategy. Let's take a look at how value investors would do this. Value investors are long-term investors who believe in quality companies. They buy stocks that are trading below their true value. These investors can use annual reports to review risks, analyze financial statements, and understand the company's business model. If you're a value investor, you'll want to understand whether the company: Regardless of what type of investor you are, you'll want to review some of the financial ratios, including theprice-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, price-to-book (P/B) ratio, and debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio. Artificial intelligence tools and technologies can make it easier for you to extract data from annual reports and help you understand some of the complex information they contain. This can free up your time so you can compare different companies rather than focusing your efforts on just one. There are thousands of AI-powered tools out there, so you'll need to do some research to determine which one works best for you.Some are free, while others come at a cost. Here's a look at some popular AI tools and how they can help you in your annual report analysis. Annual reports are important for investors because they provide a lot of key details about a company, including what the company does, the risks it faces, its financial position, and the management's vision for the future. But you can miss a lot because of the sheer volume of information embedded within. That's where AI comes in, allowing you to extract data so you can focus on your time on comparing companies to make better investment decisions.",

        "content": "New Intel (INTC) CEO Lip-Bu Tan is reportedly consideringcostly changesto the company's chip manufacturing business, rattling shares Wednesday, before a rebound Thursday. Tan is exploring a strategy shift focusing on the next-generation \"14A\" manufacturing process from \"18A,\" in an effort to win major customers, but that could see the company write down hundreds of millions or billions of dollars in development costs as losses,Reutersreported. Intel shares lost about 4% in Wednesday's session following the report, before climbing close to 3% in Thursday afternoon trading as broader markets gained. The embattled chipmaker's shares have lost nearly 30% of their value over the past year amid uncertainty surrounding the company's restructuring plans anddeal speculation. Below, we take a closer look at Intel\u2019sweekly chartand applytechnical analysisto identify key price levels to watch. Since breaking down below major support in August last year, Intel shares have tradedsidewayson above-averagetrading volume. More recently, the stock rallied from its multi-month rangebound trading floor throughout June but has run into selling pressure in early July near the 50-week moving average. However, despite the pullback, therelative strength index (RSI)remains above its neutral threshold, potentially indicating a positive shift in momentum. Let\u2019s identify three key overhead areas on Intel\u2019s chart to watch if the shares start a new move higher, as well as a crucialsupport levelworth monitoring during potential retracements in the stock. The first overhead area to watch sits around $25. A rally into this area could meetresistancenear a series ofpeaks and troughson the chart stretching back to October 2022. A close above this level could see the shares climb toward $30. This area could provide overhead selling pressure near theround numberand a trendline that connects a range of corresponding trading activity on the chart between November 2022 and June last year. Further upside in the stock could fuel a move to the $37 level. Investors who haveaccumulated sharesat lower prices may place sell orders in this location near last July\u2019scountertrendhigh and an array of closely alignedprice actionon the chart extending back to June 2022. This area also sits in the same neighborhood as a projected bars pattern upside target that takes the price bars comprising the stock\u2019s advance between February and December 2023 and overlays them from the start of last month\u2019s move higher. This prior move was selected as it followed arangeboundperiod, offering clues as to how a newuptrendfrom a trading range could play out.

        "header": "Recognizing the Red Flags: 5 Signs a Stock Is a Terrible Investment",
        "content": "With the rightonline brokerage account, stocks can be a great financial instrument to enhance your financial portfolio. They can diversify your holdings and help your capital appreciate. But it's important to recognize and understand red flags before you buy to minimize any financial losses. Pause and reconsider if a stock has high dividend yields, declining earnings, or high debt levels, for example. Let's take a look at some of the risks that come with investing in stocks and explore the red flags even further. Stocks are among the most widely held investments out there, especially for long-term investors. In fact, as many as 62% of Americans reported owning stocks in 2025.But, as popular as they are, they come with inherent risks you should understand. They include: Dividend-paying stocksare highly sought after by many investors. They are considered a great source of income, show long-term growth, and provide financial stability. But they do come with drawbacks\u2014notably, the dividendvalue trap. This happens when you chase a stock because it has a highdividend yield, only to find out that its value drops or the company cuts its dividend in the future. Unusually high dividends may seem attractive, but they generally aren't sustainable. A very high dividend often means that the company has financial problems because it is paying investors more than it can afford. If the company you invest in sees a drop in earnings, you'll want to take a step back and reevaluate it. The drop may be temporary because of a downturn or higher costs. Or the stock may beunderperformingfor a couple of quarters. This may not be much of an issue, especially if the company can bounce back. Your shares could lose value if the company's earnings continue to drop over multiple periods. This is likely due to several factors, including the inability to raise capital, a loss ofinvestor confidence, increased costs, and a drop in revenue. Along with stock price volatility, expect to see other problems, notably a cut or elimination of its dividend (if it offers one), and cutbacks to its workforce. Want to invest on your own but don't know where to start? Check out Investopedia's list ofbest robo-advisorsto help you in your investment journey. Negative free cash flowmeans that a company is spending more money than it's bringing in from its core operations. This isn't necessarily a bad sign in certain cases, especially for new or growing companies. It can be problematic for established companies, though. A company in this situation may not be able to pay its short-term debt obligations and may have trouble paying its dividend, if it offers one. Limited cash flow can also impact the company's ability to keep up with its day-to-day expenses, marketing, research and development (R&D), and payroll. Most companies have debt, which they can use as a tool for growth. But having too much debt can pose a risk to the company and its investors. While there's no threshold, you can tell whether a company has too much by reviewing some of its financial metrics, such as itsdebt-to-equity (D/E) ratio. In general, a D/E ratio of 2.0 or higher can be risky. Higher debt levels pose an increased financial risk to companies and their investors. It increases the amount of interest they have to pay on their debts and lowers the amount of free cash flow. If this keeps going, it can increase the risk of default and evenbankruptcy. This can increase volatility and put downward pressure on your stock holdings. Companies can face numerous industry challenges that can disrupt their growth and success. These include competition, inflation,supply chaindisruptions, inventory management, compliance issues, and problems retaining talent. Long-term structural challenges can have a lasting impact on a company's performance as well as its stock value, causing its stock price to drop. It can also put pressure on corporate earnings and profitability as the company must find ways to compete with others in the market, spend money to innovate, adapt to new technologies, and invest in new products. Stocks are a great way to invest and grow your wealth. But before you dive in, you should have a solid understanding of how they work. This includes knowing all the risks and red flags that come with them. Being knowledgeable about what makes a stock a bad investment can save you a lot of money in the long run. If you're still unsure of what to look out for, make sure you speak with a financial professional who can guide you through the process.",

        "content": "Tesla's (TSLA) sales declined in Germany once again in June, falling 60% compared to the same month a year ago, while some analysts were looking past Wednesday's weak deliveries report and focusing on Tesla's self-driving software. The electric vehicle giant sold 1,860 new vehicles in Germany in June, bringing its year-to-date total to 8,890 vehicles, which is down 58% from the first half of last year. The decline for Tesla came as German customers bought a total of 47,163\u00a0electric vehicles in June, up 8.6% year-over-year. The new data from Germany comes a day after Tesla reported a 14%decline in second-quarter deliveries, while production also fell from the year-ago quarter. Analysts had saidahead of the reportthat theyexpected Tesla to missestimates, which set low expectations that helped Tesla shares rise 5% Wednesday despite the disappointing numbers. In China, Tesla's sales rose in June for the first time in eight months, Wedbush analysts said in a Wednesday note, calling China the \"heart and lungs\" of Tesla's sales growth potential. The analysts held their $500 price target, adding that Tesla's autonomous software \"remains the biggest transformation to the auto industry in modern day history and in our view, Tesla will own the autonomous market in the US with the initial launch of unsupervised FSD in Austin.\" Goldman Sachs analysts lifted their price target for Tesla stock to $315 on Thursday while keeping their \"neutral\" rating, according to Visible Alpha. The new target puts them just above the current Visible Alpha consensus of $307.65. Tesla shares were little changed in recent trading Thursday, ahead of anearly close for the holiday weekend. They are down more than 20% since the start of the year, as shares have recently been hampered by CEO Elon Muskonce again stepping uphis attacks on President Donald Trump'ssignature budget bill.",

        "content": "Nvidia stock (NVDA) closed at a record high on Thursday, rising 1.3% amid a broader market rally and putting shares one step closer to unseating Apple (AAPL) as the most valuable company in market history. During Thursday's shortened trading session ahead of the July Fourth holiday, shares of the AI chipmaker rose more than 2% to give the company a market cap of $3.92 trillion. As of Thursday's close, the company's market cap settled at $3.89 trillion, just fractionally off the record of $3.915 trillion Apple clinched in late 2024. The iPhone maker's value has dropped since then as it struggled to catch up to its Big Tech peers on AI and has contended with President Trump'sthreat to hit its overseas-made products with tariffs. Investors have piled into Nvidia after its most recent quarterly earnings report in late May showed the chipmaker continuing to thrive, despite US restrictions on Chinese use of its chips. The stock has continued to notchfresh record highssince late June. Thursday's rally adds to what's been a remarkable turnaround for Nvidia stock aftera rocky start to 2025, with shares now up more than 19% this year. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said Thursday he expects Nvidia to hit a $4 trillion market capitalization this summer and potentially $5 trillion over the next 18 months. \u201cWe believe tech stocks will have a very strong second half of the year,\" he said in a note to clients Thursday. \"Our bullish view is that investors are still underestimating the tidal wave of growth on the horizon from the $2 trillion of spending over the next 3 years coming from enterprise and government spending around AI technology and use cases.\" Other market watchers are more skeptical about the AI boom. Legendary short seller Jim Chanostold Bloombergthat the \"ecosystem around the AI boom\" is similar to the dot-com bubble. \u201cBut it is a riskier revenue stream because if people pull back, they can pull back CapEx very easily. Projects can get put on hold ... and that immediately shows up in disappointing revenues and earnings forecast, if it happens,\" Chanos said. \u201cWe\u2019re not there yet, but that\u2019s one of the risks out there that I think a lot of people are underestimating,\u201d he added.

        "content": "NVIDIAhas recently been in the spotlight due to a significant purchase by IREN Limited, showcasing widespread market application and pushing its stock price up by 54% over the last quarter. This rise is reflective of the overall tech sector momentum, supported by a buoyant Nasdaq. The company\u2019s robust first-quarter earnings, major share buybacks, and strategic alliances further fueled investor optimism. While broader market trends like the Nasdaq's rally and recent economic data supported this growth, NVIDIA\u2019s involvement in high-performance AI and strategic expansions significantly contributed to its impressive performance. You should learn about the 1 warning sign we've spotted with NVIDIA. Trump's oil boom is here \u2014 pipelines are primed to profit. Discover the 22 US stocks riding the wave. The significant investment by IREN Limited in NVIDIA, combined with the acquisition of partnerships in the automotive sector, may enhance NVIDIA's growth narrative by potentially expanding its AI market presence. These developments could bolster revenue from both AI and automotive sectors, aligning with NVIDIA's strategic focus on high-performance AI and autonomous vehicle platforms. Such partnerships are crucial as they can drive up impending revenue streams and refine earnings forecasts, positioning NVIDIA well in an evolving tech landscape. Over a five-year period, NVIDIA achieved a very large total return of 1,444%, reflecting its impressive growth trajectory. This performance starkly contrasts with its one-year return, surpassing the US Market's 13.2% and the US Semiconductor industry's 14.4% return over the same period. NVIDIA's ability to outperform its peers and broader market emphasizes its dominant position and innovative prowess. With the current share price at US$113.54 and an analyst price target of US$174.18, there remains a potential upside of over 50% based on the consensus. This disparity signifies room for share appreciation if NVIDIA successfully capitalizes on its strategic initiatives. Continued execution on growth drivers like the Blackwell architecture, alongside recent earnings momentum, could see analysts' revenue and earnings forecasts materialize, impacting future valuations and market expectations positively.

        "content": "Wedbush Securities managing director and global head of technology research Dan Ives joins Market Domination to share his five stock picks in the tech sector (XLK): Nvidia (NVDA), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Palantir (PLTR), and Tesla (TSLA). Ives and Catalyst Funds co-founder, chief investment officer, and senior portfolio manager David Miller examine the pros and cons of owning tech names directly, compared to buying the S&P 500 (^GSPC) since the sector has such an oversized impact on the index. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Dominationhere. In terms of your picks for the second half of the year, Dan, you're looking at Nvidia, you're looking at meta, which you mentioned already, you're looking at Microsoft, which is trading at a record again, you're looking at Palantir, Ditto, and you're looking at Tesla is the other one. Tesla I feel like is like one of these things is not like the other, certainly in terms of the stock performance at least, but just briefly here for the second half of the year, why are you focusing on on those five? Because I mean ultimately it's each phase of what I think starting to play out, of course, Nvidia, not just 4 trillion, I think it's the path to 5 trillion market cap. And then you look at on the hyperscaler side in terms of Microsoft, meta leading on the consumer, Palantir, I think that's a trillion dollar market cap in the next two to three years. And Tesla I've used the best AI playing along with Nvidia because at times worth a trillion dollars is a story. It all comes down to those that focus on valuation. You know, they've missed every transformational tech stock the last 20 years. And I always say, like the bears when they're in hibernation mode in their caves, they can't find AI in the spreadsheet. I mean, David, I would ask as well though, on the flip side, I guess I'll put this to both of you, David, I'll put this to you first. Given how heavily heavily weighted these companies are in the S&P 500, why shouldn't investors just buy the S&P 500? They still can participate in a lot of the upside from these stocks because they are so heavily weighted, but they also get maybe the cushion of some of the other stuff. David, how do you think about that? So, I guess the way I would think about that is first off I agree, you're generally right. You're probably going to do very well if you own the S&P 500, and if you don't own these names individually, that's not the end of the world. But do you really need to own the large airlines, which have never made money over decades on net? Do you need to own the large automakers that aren't Tesla that are incredibly difficult businesses with enormous pension liabilities? I I think conceptually you do want to own a lot of those names that are in the S&P 500 that are showing great free cash flow growth, great dominance within their industries, great products that are making people's lives better, but you don't have to really own some of those companies in the S&P that are in much more competitive industries. And Dan, what about you? I mean, I think that I think David, great way to put it. I put it another way, I'd just say, I want to own the Ferraris in the left lane going 100 miles an hour. I get everyone to a while, you'll get a speeding ticket. But I don't want to own the minivans in the right lane going 45 miles an hour with a broken radio. I'd rather be in the left lane on those. And that those to me, that's where you stick in big tech, and that's why I think it's get the popcorn out. It's going to be a very exciting second half.",

        "content": "Shares ofPalantir Technologies Inc.PLTR, which sells a well-liked artificial intelligence (AI)-powered software platform, have surged 74.7% so far this year, outperforming the leading AI chip maker,NVIDIA Corporation\u2019s NVDA 17.1% gain. Can Palantir keep outperforming NVIDIA in the second half, and is it the better AI stock for your portfolio? Image Source: Zacks Investment Research The surge in demand for NVIDIA\u2019s state-of-the-art new-generation Blackwell chips helped the company\u2019s sales grow 69% year over year to $44.1 billion in the fiscal first quarter, which ended on April 27. NVIDIA overcame supply-chain bottlenecks and delivered Blackwell AI servers to customers such asMicrosoft CorporationMSFT. Strong demand for AI chips will boost NVIDIA\u2019s sales, supported by increased developer adoption of the CUDA platform. The AI revolution in self-driving cars and autonomous robots also benefits NVIDIA. As major cloud computing companies likeAmazon.com, Inc.AMZN andAlphabet Inc.GOOGL purchase NVIDIA\u2019s graphics processing units (GPUs), in which the company holds a large share, the company is likely to see further growth. President Trump\u2019s tariffs and export restrictions on AI chips to China may impact NVIDIA\u2019s sales, but the company is adjusting its hardware specifications to resume sales there. Even without China, NVIDIA is positioned to benefit from the worldwide demand for AI capabilities. A rise in both commercial and government contracts helped Palantir increase its revenues in the first quarter. Commercial revenues increased 71% year over year (YoY) to $255 million, while government revenues rose 45% YoY to $373 million. Palantir\u2019s sales growth has contributed to strong financial results, with net income reaching $217.7 million in the first quarter, more than doubling last year\u2019s $106.1 million. Palantir\u2019s adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $370 million, up 42% YoY. Additionally, the remaining performance obligations of $1.9 billion and an estimated total addressable market of over $1 trillion in the next decade indicate Palantir\u2019s continued strength. Palantir\u2019s Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), capable of automating tasks beyond human reach, drove its revenue growth. The company\u2019s new AI products, like Warp Speed, which uses AI to improve U.S. manufacturing efficiency, are also expected to boost revenues. Meanwhile, Palantir shareholders are excited about President Trump\u2019s \u201cBig, Beautiful Bill\u201d. This is because Palantir is a key player in developing the Golden Dome missile defense system, included in the bill.\u00a0 Moreover, the ongoing geopolitical tensions and the AI arms race could further benefit Palantir. Palantir\u2019s AIP and other AI products are expected to see heightened commercial success in the near term, while strong demand for new Blackwell GPUs will boost NVIDIA\u2019s profit margins. However, the only issue with investing in Palantir is its lofty valuations. Per the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, Palantir trades at 226.62 times forward earnings, while NVIDIA\u2019s forward earnings multiple is 37.07. So, an economic downturn may quickly lower Palantir\u2019s share price, unlike NVIDIA\u2019s. P/E \u2013 F1PALANTIR TECH (PLTR) vs. NVIDIA CORP (NVDA) Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Therefore, it\u2019s safe to conclude that NVIDIA is a better stock than Palantir in the second half. Palantir stock only suits aggressive investors. But those seeking stable returns should consider NVIDIA. At the moment, both stocks possess a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

I don't want to scale up here, but if the disk looks okay, I'll ride the momentum in the short term. If it jumps to the upside and starts to fall sharply, especially if it breaks below VWAP early and can't get back up, I'll probably buy some puts or bear spreads targeting a pullback to the $145 area, where there's been support  I won't lie, this stuff feels frothy. the RSI index is quite stretched and has risen vertically with little to no consolidation.

        "content": "Major U.S. equities indexes pushed higher Thursday in a half-day of trading as the nation geared up for Independence Day celebrations over the three-day weekend. The upbeat pre-holiday market session followed the Bureau of Labor Statistics release of thelatest labor market data, showing that U.S. employers added 147,000 jobs in June, exceeding economists' expectations, while the unemployment rate saw an unanticipated downtick. The S&P 500 advanced 0.8%, heading into the Fourth of July with a bang by setting its third record closing high in the abbreviated trading week. The Nasdaq Composite also reached another record high, notching a gain of 1% on Thursday, while the Dow ended 0.8% higher. Solar power stocks gained ground as the massive tax and spending bill backed by President Trump was set to be approved in Congress. Although the legislation includes provisions to phase out federal tax credits for clean-energy projects, the Senate's final bill omitted an additional tax on solar and wind projects with a certain level of participation by foreign entities that had been present in a previous draft. Shares of panel manufacturer First Solar (FSLR) surged 8.5%, notching the S&P 500's top daily performance, while shares of microinverter specialist Enphase Energy (ENPH) gained 3.9%. The U.S. government eliminated restrictions on exporting semiconductor design software to China, according to announcements by several industry players, who said they are in the process of resuming sales to the country. Shares of chip-design software firms Cadence Design Systems (CDNS) and Synopsys (SNPS) were up 5.1% and 4.9%, respectively. CrowdStrike (CRWD) ended the day up 3.6% at a record high after Wedbush analystslifted their price target on the stockand described the company as the \"gold standard\" in the cybersecurity industry. The Wedbush team highlighted CrowdStrike's strength in the artificial intelligence security space. The unexpected strength in Thursday morning's jobs report reduced expectations among traders that the Federal Reserve could resume interest-rate cuts as soon as its July meeting. Declining optimism for lower mortgage rates pressured home builders' stocks. Lennar (LEN) shares dropped 4.1%, losing the most of any S&P 500 stock on Thursday, while shares of D.R. Horton (DHI) and NVR Inc. (NVR) were down 2.7% and 1.9%, respectively. Agribusiness firm Bunge Global (BG) completed its acquisition of the grain-handling business Viterra, despite concerns that the merger could limit competition in the grain and canola markets. Bunge believes the deal can help the company compete more effectively against larger rivals as it navigates uncertainties in the global grain markets related to tariffs and geopolitical tensions. However, Bunge shares slipped 3.6% Thursday. After opening the session solidly in positive territory, shares of pharmaceutical giant Merck (MRK) lost ground throughout the day, ending with a 1.8% loss. Although Merck is counting on growth driven by Winrevair, its newly launched treatment for pulmonary arterial hypertension, the company faces a headwind related to Keytruda, a treatment for several types of cancer that is set to lose exclusivity in 2028.",

That leaves Nvidia just a breath away from Apple's $3.915 trillion peak set in late 2024. The move reflects how aggressively Wall Street is positioning around the AI buildoutwhere Nvidia's high-end chips are fast becoming foundational infrastructure. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. There's a full-blown arms race happening across big tech. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), Meta (NASDAQ:META), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) are all scaling up AI data centers, and Nvidia is supplying the muscle. Its GPUs remain the go-to for training the largest generative models, and that demand isn't slowing. Since April, when trade worries briefly pulled tech lower, Nvidia's stock has roared back nearly 70%, helped by optimism that looming tariff pressures could ease. Microsoft now holds second place at $3.7 trillion, with Apple in third at $3.19 trillionboth trailing Nvidia's pace in this latest AI leg up. But with Nvidia now making up 7% of the S&P 500 (SPY), and together with other mega caps accounting for over a quarter of the index, the stakes are rising. Valuation looks less stretched than headlines might suggestshares are trading at around 32x forward earnings, below the 5-year average. Still, some caution is creeping in.

On the other hand, the Dow registered a gain of 0.77%, and the technology-centric Nasdaq increased by 1.02%. Shares of the maker of graphics chips for gaming and artificial intelligence witnessed a gain of 10.8% over the previous month, beating the performance of the Computer and Technology sector with its gain of 8.25%, and the S&P 500's gain of 4.99%. The upcoming earnings release of Nvidia will be of great interest to investors. The company's earnings report is expected on August 27, 2025. It is anticipated that the company will report an EPS of $0.99, marking a 45.59% rise compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Meanwhile, the latest consensus estimate predicts the revenue to be $45.69 billion, indicating a 52.1% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Looking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $4.24 per share and revenue of $197.54 billion. These totals would mark changes of +41.81% and +51.37%, respectively, from last year. It's also important for investors to be aware of any recent modifications to analyst estimates for Nvidia. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. Hence, positive alterations in estimates signify analyst optimism regarding the business and profitability. Our research reveals that these estimate alterations are directly linked with the stock price performance in the near future. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model. The Zacks Rank system, which varies between #1 (Strong Buy) and #5 (Strong Sell), carries an impressive track record of exceeding expectations, confirmed by external audits, with stocks at #1 delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.04% higher within the past month. Nvidia presently features a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). With respect to valuation, Nvidia is currently being traded at a Forward P/E ratio of 37.07. This expresses a discount compared to the average Forward P/E of 38.86 of its industry. One should further note that NVDA currently holds a PEG ratio of 1.31. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The average PEG ratio for the Semiconductor - General industry stood at 2.72 at the close of the market yesterday. The Semiconductor - General industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 194, which puts it in the bottom 22% of all 250+ industries. The Zacks Industry Rank assesses the strength of our separate industry groups by calculating the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks contained within the groups.

        "content": "Robinhood Markets earlier this week said it would offer European users the option to trade \u201cstock tokens,\u201d and that it would give away $5 worth of \u201ctokenized\u201d stock in two major private companies, OpenAI and SpaceX, to eligible investors. OpenAI on Wednesdaydisavowed the offering, writing, \u201cThese 'OpenAI tokens' are not OpenAI equity. We did not partner with Robinhood, were not involved in this, and do not endorse it.\u201d The company urged investors to \u201cplease be careful.\u201d Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev responded in an X post on Wednesday night: \u201cWhile it is true that they aren\u2019t technically \u2018equity\u2019 (you can see the precise dynamics in our Terms for those interested), the tokens effectively give retail investors exposure to these private assets.\u201dSeparately, a spokesperson said that the tokens provide \"indirect exposure... and are enabled by Robinhood\u2019s ownership stake in aspecial purpose vehicle.\" Elon Musk, the CEO of SpaceX, has not commented publicly on the stock tokens. But he did seize the opportunity to take a jab at OpenAI, with which hehas sparredin the past. \"Your 'equity' is fake,\" Musk replied to the company's post. So if stock tokens aren\u2019t equity, what are they? Stock tokensare effectively the blockchain equivalent of equity; they represent one\u2019s transferrable ownership stake in a company. But they differ from regular stock in a few key ways. First, they\u2019re traded on ablockchainrather than on public exchanges. Second, they can be stored in the investor\u2019sdigital wallet, rather than being held by a custodian, like a brokerage. Third, because they are on-chain, they can be used in other decentralized finance activities, likestaking. Tenev, the Robinhood CEO, made the case for stock tokenization in a recent appearance onBloomberg\u2019s \u201cOdd Lots\u201d podcast. Tokenized stocks can be held directly by the investor who owns them, which gives them more flexibility in trading. Stock that\u2019s not in the custody of a brokerage can still be traded when that broker experiences technical difficulties; an urgent sell order can be redirected to a different broker and filled. The decentralized nature of blockchain could make it easier for stocks to trade 24/7. As long as computers are processing transactions on the blockchain, traders can buy and sell stocks without using exchanges and clearinghouses with fixed operating hours. Finally, tokenization makes stock available to put ina collateralized lending pool or to stake, giving investors additional sources of passive income. Robinhood is launching tokenized private company stock in Europe because it has less stringent rules governing private market investment. In the U.S., private markets are accessible only toaccredited investors\u2014individuals and businesses with enough money that, in the eyes of the government, they don\u2019t need the protections that come from regulatory oversight of public markets. Public companies are required by theSecurities and Exchange Commissionto make regular financial disclosures and provide the public with material business updates. Private companies have more relaxed disclosure rules, primarily because accredited investors are assumed to be rich or savvy enough to take on the additional risk of private investments. Tenev, in aWashington Postop-ed in January, said opening private markets to retail investors was central to Robinhood\u2019s tokenization push. \u201cTokenizing private-company stock would enable retail investors to invest in leading companies early in their life cycles, before they potentially go public at valuations of more than $100 billion,\u201d he wrote. There is an obvious benefit to everyday investors being able to invest in the hottest start-ups; under existing rules, the outsized gains that come from early investment often accrue to the wealthy and well-connected. Though, public disclosure rules exist to help everyday investors and their advisors make informed decisions and protect them from fraud, and investing in small upstarts is inherently riskier than buying shares of an established public company. Tenev told \u201cOdd Lots\u201d that stock tokens could become available in the U.S. without new legislation, and that Robinhood has been discussing tokenization with the SEC's Crypto Task Force. \u201cI think they\u2019re pretty keen to make this happen,\u201d he said, referring to rules that would govern the tokens.",

The fund viewed Pop Mart as undervalued given the popularity of its characters and intellectual property products. Its shares have soared roughly 600% over the past year. While Samsung\u2019s shares have trailed those of SK Hynix, which supplies HBM to Nvidia Corp, the firm\u2019s next-generation DRAM chip could help the stock catch up with peers once production takes off, Linton said. Samsung shares are up 20% this year, while SK Hynix\u2019s have jumped 60%. \u201cCurrently everyone is underweight\u201d Samsung, said Linton, who also owns SK Hynix shares. \u201cWe\u2019ve taken a bit more positive view, partly because the valuation looks very attractive.\u201d Chinese equities make up almost a third of the fund. Linton owns shares of Naura Technology Group Co., which he sees as a proxy to China\u2019s rising semiconductor prowess thanks to its localization efforts and growth that\u2019s outpaced domestic counterparts.
