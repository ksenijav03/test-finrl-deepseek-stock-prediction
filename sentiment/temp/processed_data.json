        "content": "While there isn't an official start date marking the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, I personally like to use Nov. 30, 2022, as my timestamp. This is the day that OpenAI released ChatGPT to the public, virtually changing how businesses and consumers access information at the flip of a switch. Back then,Amazon(AMZN1.81%)sported a market capitalization of $835 billion. Today, the company's value is almost triple -- hovering at around $2.3 trillion. While Amazon may not fetch as much attention as its \"Magnificent Seven\" peersNvidiaorTesla, the company is quietly building a thriving AI ecosystem -- and Wall Street is finally starting to take notice. Last month, investors learned that billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman initiated a stake in Amazon through his investment firm, Pershing Square Capital Management. Let's explore how Amazon is integrating AI across its various businesses. More importantly, I'll analyze the recent price action in the stock to help make the case for why I think Amazon is positioned to become Wall Street's first $5 trillion stock. The most obvious area of Amazon's ecosystem that has benefited from the AI boom so far is the company's cloud computing segment, Amazon Web Services (AWS). Over the last couple of years, AWS has invested billions into a start-up called Anthropic, which competes with OpenAI. Throughout this partnership, AWS has witnessed notable revenue acceleration combined with significant expansion in operating margins. Image source: Investor Relations. This is an important notion to understand, as AWS accounts for the majority of operating profits across the entire Amazon ecosystem. Thanks to a successful partnership with Anthropic so far, Amazon now has even more financial flexibility, which it can parlay into other AI-powered services. For instance, Amazon is also testing various forms of AI robotics in its fulfillment centers, which could theoretically bring new levels of efficiency and automation to processes previously managed by human labor. Lastly, Amazon is also developing its own custom chipsets -- dubbedTrainiumandInferentia. In the long run, these could be more opportunities for Amazon to complement its existing hardware business while entering new markets to compete more directly with existing semiconductor designers. Image Source: Getty Images. As of this writing (June 11), Amazon's stock has declined by roughly 1% on the year. While that might initially come across as uninspiring, consider how sharply shares have rebounded since bottoming out at around $167 in April.  AMZNdata byYCharts. It's my suspicion that Ackman took advantage of the sell-off last month andbought the dip. I bring this up because, interestingly, Pershing Square's Amazon position was not included in the fund's13F filingfor the first quarter. Rather, Ackman's Amazon position became publicly reported following news of a call he held with his investors. The chart below benchmarks Amazon's market cap growth relative to several of its Magnificent Seven peers since the release of ChatGPT. I purposely excludedAppleandTeslafrom this analysis, as I don't see much in the way of direct competition to Amazon. AMZN Market Capdata byYCharts. There are a couple of notable takeaways from the trends above. First, Amazon's valuation has risen considerably more than those of bothMicrosoftandAlphabetover the last couple of years. This is significant because both companies compete fiercely with Amazon in the cloud computing market, specifically. I see this as a potential signal that investors may be more bullish on Amazon's ability to maintain an edge in the cloud landscape, despite intensifyinginvestments in AI infrastructurefrom the competition. In addition, it's clear that Nvidia has been the best Magnificent Seven investment throughout the AI revolution thus far. But as I alluded to above, Amazon actually has a unique opportunity to begin competing with Nvidia through the introduction of its new chipsets. In my eyes, Amazon has a strong foundation to continueacceleratingrevenue and profit growth for the long run. Despite already achieving a monster run over the last couple of years, I think investors will continue to place a premium on Amazon stock relative to its peers, leading to furthervaluation expansionin the years to come. For these reasons, I believe Amazon's current trajectory supports the idea that the company could see a more than twofold rise in market cap and reach a $5 trillion valuation before its peers.",

The company, which expects to launch several advertising features globally over the next few months, said that it\u2019s introducing channel subscriptions, promoted channels, and ads to itsWhatsAppUpdates tab, which it says attracts about 1.5 billion users daily. Meta shares, which rose nearly 3% to close around $702 on Monday, have gained 20% since the start of the year and are just 5% below theirrecord high, set in mid-February, as of Monday\u2019s close. The stock, which is the top performing member of theMagnificent Sevenso far in 2025, has impressed investors with strong AI-driven ad revenue growth and plans to significantlyexpand its AI capacity. Last week, startup Scale AI said the social media giant had made a \"significant new investment\" in the company, with the development following reports that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been frustrated with the company's level of AI progress.

        "content": "By Che Pan and Eduardo Baptista BEIJING (Reuters) -U.S. chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) will attend a major supply-chain expo in July in Beijing for the first time, Chinese state broadcaster CCTV reported on Tuesday. The third edition of the China International Supply Chain Expo will be held from July 16 to 20 and will welcome more than 230 new Chinese and foreign participants, CCTV reported. Nvidia is the market leader for artificial intelligence-related chips. The company is having to defend its decreasing share of the Chinese market while complying with increasingly strict U.S. export controls aimed at curbing China's access to the types of advanced chips the firm manufactures. The expo is not known to deliver big deals. However, it provides an opportunity for foreign participants to demonstrate commitment to the Chinese market. Premier Li Qiang spoke at the expo's opening edition in 2023, highlighting the reliability of Chinese supply chains at a time when some Western countries were calling to reduce dependence on China. Trade disputes with the U.S. in particular have since intensified. Even so, U.S. firms will represent the largest contingent of foreign businesses at this year's expo, with an increase of 15% compared to last year, CCTV reported.

        "content": "Since late 2022, no trend has been held in higher regard on Wall Street than the evolution ofartificial intelligence (AI). Software and systems having the ability to make split-second decisions without human oversight represents a technology with broad-reaching potential in virtually every industry around the globe. As with most next-big-thing technologies, addressable market projections for AI are all over the map. But based on one prognostication from the analysts at PwC, the combination of productivity improvements and consumption-side effects can boost worldwide gross domestic product $15.7 trillion come 2030. With an addressable market this vast, there's little question that a long list of companies, both hardware/infrastructure and practical application, can be big-time winners. Image source: Getty Images. However, Wall Street's brightest and most-successful billionaire money managers appear to have mixed feelings about the future return potential of Wall Street's AI darling,Nvidia(NVDA0.12%). Whereas Nvidia is the largest individual stock holding for Millennium Management's arbitrage specialist Israel Englander, it's a stock that'sbeen sold for eight consecutive quartersby billionaire growth investor extraordinaire Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management. To preface this discussion, Englander oversees a trulymassiveportfolio that's highlighted by option-based hedging with many of its individual stock positions. Though Nvidia isn't its largest pure holding, based on the nominal value of fully executed options contracts, itisthe biggest individual stock by market cap for Englander's fund, excluding options contracts and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Millennium's Form 13 filing shows the fund held 9,233,791 shares, as of the end of March. Billionaire Israel Englander's apparent optimism for Nvidia can likely be boiled down to one or more of the following four factors. First,Nvidia is enjoying a monopoly like market shareof the graphics processing units (GPUs) being deployed by businesses in AI-accelerated data centers. Since introducing the Hopper (H100) and rolling out the successor Blackwell GPU, businesses haven't been able to order Nvidia's hardware fast enough. Secondly, but building on this previous point, demand for AI-GPUs has persistently overwhelmed the available supply. Even with direct competitors ramping up their production (e.g.,Advanced Micro Deviceswith its Instinct series GPUs), leading chip fabrication companyTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturingcan't increase its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate capacity fast enough to satisfy demand. As long as AI-GPU scarcity exists, Nvidia has a reason to charge a premium for the GPUs it's selling. The end result for Nvidia has been a big uptick in itsgross margin. Optimists like billionaire Israel Englander are also typically impressed by Nvidia's innovative prowess.CEO Jensen Huang has made it a point to invest aggressively in advanced chipsand bring a faster/more energy-efficient AI-GPU to market on annual basis. Later this year, Blackwell Ultra is expected to make its debut, which will be followed by Vera Rubin and Vera Rubin Ultra in the second halves of 2026 and 2027, respectively. These latter two chips will run on the brand-new Vera processor and should have no trouble sustaining Nvidia's compute advantages. Lastly, Nvidia's operating performance has somewhat caught up to its skyrocketing valuation. With shares of the company swooning during the first quarter due to tariff-related concerns andChina-based DeepSeek's large language model chatbot reveal, Nvidia'sforward price-to-earnings ratiobriefly dipped below 20. Some investors clearly see value, even in the wake of Nvidia adding more than $3 trillion in market cap since 2023 began. But there's another side to this story that Philippe Laffont's persistent selling of Nvidia stock brings to light. Image source: Getty Images. While Coatue Management's billionaire chief isn't exactly bearish on Nvidia -- it still represents a sizable holding for his fund -- he hassold shares of Wall Street's favorite AI stock for eight consecutive quarters. Taking into accountNvidia's historic 10-for-1 forward split in June 2024, here's the progression of Coatue's quarter-end share count in Nvidia since March 31, 2023: To reiterate, more than 8.5 million shares held isn't chump change -- but there's a reason (or four) why Laffont has sold 83% of his fund's stake in the company over the last two years. Profit-taking is absolutely a possibility for Coatue Management's boss, as well as other billionaires who've reduced their exposure to Nvidia. We've never witnessed a megacap stock gain $3 trillion in market cap so quickly before, so ringing the register might be viewed as a wise move. However, there's also the logical expectation that competition is going to pick up in a big way for Nvidia in the coming years. Even though it's in no danger of losing its spot atop the compute leaderboard, there are more variables to consider than just how fast an AI-GPU can be.  Competitive pressures appear to be chipping away at Nvidia's high gross margin.NVDA Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly)data byYCharts. For instance, many of Nvidia's top customers by net sales (i.e., most members of the \"Magnificent Seven\") areinternally developing AI chips to use in their data centers. Though this hardware is no threat to Nvidia on an external basis, these internally developed chips are considerably cheaper than Hopper and Blackwell, as well as more readily accessible. The use of internal hardware means less prospective real estate for Nvidia to win in the future. It's also a drag on the AI-GPU scarcity that's powered its gross margin higher. Laffont might also berightly concerned about President Donald Trump's tariff and trade policy. For three years, beginning under former President Joe Biden and continuing under Trump, exports of high-powered AI chips and related equipment to China have been restricted. With President Trump emphasizing national security and the need for AI innovation to remain within domestic borders, Nvidia could lose out on billions of dollars in quarterly sales from one of its largest individual markets. Finally, billionaire Philippe Laffont might recognize thegravity of historical precedent when it comes to the AI revolution. For more than three decades, every game-changing technology or innovation has worked its way through a bubble that eventually burst. While businesses are aggressively investing in AI infrastructure, most aren't generating a positive return on their AI investments, nor are they optimizing their AI solutions. It's going to take time for artificial intelligence to mature as a technology, which means there's a strong likelihood of an AI bubble forming, bursting, and dragging Nvidia's share price considerably lower. Though Nvidia has the tools to be a long-term winner once AI matures, it hasall the hallmarks of a company priced for perfectionin an imperfect early stage trend.",

        "content": "Exchange-traded funds (ETFs)can be excellent tools for investing around key themes like artificial intelligence (AI) without the burden of having to pick the right AI-winning stocks among the wide assortment of choices. The AI boom continues to show tremendous long-term return potential for investors. The IDC projects AI to boost the global economy by $20 trillion by 2030. Investors can see this playing out by just looking at the strong growth leading companies are reporting across semiconductors, software, and cloud computing, but there's more growth on the way from leaders in robotics and autonomous vehicles. Here are two ETFs that can help you profit from this generational investment opportunity. Image source: Getty Images. Dan Ives is a highly regarded tech analyst on Wall Street. He is currently the managing director and senior equity research analyst covering the tech sector at Wedbush Securities. TheDan Ives Wedbush AI Revolution ETF(IVES1.90%)tracks the performance of 30 handpicked companies from Ives' coverage universe -- all of which are competitively positioned to benefit from the global transformation ofAI. The top holding as of June 10, 2025, wasMicrosoftat 5.65% of the fund. This is followed byNvidia(5.34%),Broadcom(4.82%), andTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(4.77%). A few of the smaller holdings areMongoDB(1.52%) andSoundhound AI(0.95%). The ETF provides a nice mixture of large established companies like Microsoft and Nvidia, while providing investors the chance to benefit from the explosive growth potential of smaller AI companies like Soundhound AI, a leader in voice recognition technology. This fund provides broad diversification across leaders in cloud computing, cybersecurity, robotics, electric cars, software, and semiconductors. The holdings are weighted using a formula that takes into account each company'smarket cap. Larger companies by market cap are weighted higher as a percentage of the fund's assets, while smaller companies are weighted less, which helps minimize risk. Keep in mind, this is a new fund that just started trading in June. It's also the first ETF launched by Wedbush. Given its limited operating history, it might be wise to start with a small allocation if you decide to invest. Wedbush is a reputable Wall Street firm, and this ETF has a promising list of holdings. But investors may want to see how this fund executes its objective before committing a lot of money to it. Be aware, too, that the fund'sexpense ratiois on the high side for an ETF at 0.75%. This comes to about $7.50 in annual expenses for every $1,000 invested in the fund. But that's not much, considering the exposure you gain to high-growth companies with attractive return potential. Image source: Getty Images. TheRoundhill Magnificent Seven ETF(MAGS1.62%)tracks the performance of the elite group of tech stocks known as the \"Magnificent Seven.\" All the companies included in the Dan Ives ETF are also included in the Wedbush AI Revolution ETF, so investors may want to buy only one or the other, but it doesn't hurt to own both. The Magnificent Seven are some of the largest companies by market cap and include the following: The fund rebalances every quarter to maintain an equal weighting for each holding. The consensus estimate on Wall Street projects these companies' annualizedearningsgrowth to range from 10% (Apple) to 29% (Nvidia). Given those estimates, an investor who dollar-cost averages into this ETF over time can expect to earn returns consistent with the group's future earnings growth. Their expected earnings growth could be enough to outperform theS&P 500, which has historically returned about 10% over the last several decades. One thing to note about the Roundhill ETF is that rebalancing the holdings every quarter has its pros and cons. While this maintains consistent exposure to the holdings in the fund, the downside is that investors miss out on the upside if one of the stocks significantly outperforms the rest over the long term. However, this is an excellent ETF to invest in the most dominant technology companies in one transaction without managing separate stock holdings in your portfolio. It also offers a low expense ratio of 0.29%, representing an annual expense of just $2.90 for every $1,000 invested. As a group, the Magnificent Seven have a combined market cap of $17 trillion, $2 trillion in annual revenue, and $395 billion infree cash flow. If you think of this group as one business, it is a no-brainer investment for the long term.",

        "content": "Nvidia(NVDA0.12%)stock has skyrocketed over the past few years, advancing an eye-popping 800% over three years, thanks to the company's role in the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. As the world's top AI chip designer, it's generated record revenue -- surpassing $130 billion in the latest fiscal year -- and investors have piled into this exciting growth story. Now, though, as Nvidia's quarterly revenue has transitioned to double-digit growth from triple-digit, investors have been wondering if the stock will keep up its momentum. On top of that, the company faces one key challenge at the moment: U.S. controls on chip exports to China, a significant market for Nvidia. Still, the global AI market has bright days ahead, with analysts forecasting a compound annual growth rate in the double-digits to reach more than $2 trillion over the next several years. Nvidia, as the chip leader, is perfectly positioned to benefit in this environment. Does that make Nvidia your ticket to becoming a millionaire? Let's find out. Image source: Getty Images. First, let's take a glance into the past and catch up on the fast-paced Nvidia story so far. This company, founded more than 30 years ago by current chief Jensen Huang, in its early days served the gaming market with itsgraphics processing units(GPUs). These powerful chips, with the ability to simultaneously process many tasks, soon emerged as a great tool for other industries. And in recent years, they showed their strengths in AI -- and became the key to developing powerful large language models\u00a0in a highly efficient manner. All of this has translated into revenue growth for the company and a high level of profitability on sales, with gross margin exceeding 70% quarter after quarter. As mentioned, what's disturbed this high-growth story in recent times has been concerns aboutNvidia's future in China. The U.S. a few years ago established export controls on GPUs to be shipped to China and most recently even halted sales of the GPUs Nvidia designed specifically with these controls in mind. Another concern over the past several weeks is the U.S. plan to establish import tariffs. Right now, electronics are generally excluded, but the Trump Administration says a tariff plan for these items is on the way. Now let's consider Nvidia's longer-term prospects. The China and general export situation remain challenges, but Nvidia also has been quick to take action. For example, the company has launched investments into U.S. manufacturing to reduce its reliance on exports, and two factories should ramp up in the coming 12 to 15 months, Nvidia recently said. These investments and a lack of sales in the Chinese market could weigh on growth, but considering Nvidia's market leadership and the fact that the U.S. is the company's biggest market, I think this impact will be limited. It's also important to note that Nvidia's shift to double-digit growth from triple-digit is normal as sales have reached extremely high levels. It's much easier to generate triple-digit growth when quarterly revenue is low. With all of this in mind, is Nvidia your ticket to becoming a millionaire? Right now, you can get in on Nvidia for a reasonable price as the stock trades for 33 timesforward earnings estimates, lower than a few months ago, and revenue continues to soar.  NVDA PE Ratio (Forward)data byYCharts The stock makes a great buy for any investor who wants to bet on the AI revolution, as Nvidia is positioned to play a critical role through every chapter of development and as AI is put to use. Still, I wouldn't count on Nvidia, on its own, to make you a millionaire. An example illustrates my point: If you invest $10,000 in the stock today, and it climbs 800% in the coming years as it did over the past three, the value of your investment would be $90,000. That's fantastic, but far from $1 million. Here's some good news though: Nvidia could play a valuable role as you travel on the path to wealth. If you invest in this top tech player along with a diversified group of quality stocks and hold on to them for a number of years, you could end up with a million-dollar portfolio over the long run.",

        "content": "Most artificial intelligence (AI) models are trained and then deployed in data centers, which are filled with thousands of specialized chips called graphics processing units (GPUs). Most AI developers don't have the financial resources to build that infrastructure themselves, but they can rent it from a handful of technology giants that operate hundreds of centralized data centers all over the world. Those tech giants typically buy most of their GPUs fromNvidia(NVDA0.12%), which supplies the best AI hardware in the industry. The chipmaker continues to experience more demand than it can fill, which is driving a surge in its revenue and earnings. In fact, Nvidia has added a staggering $3 trillion to its market capitalization since the beginning of 2023, and it's now the second most valuable company in the world. However, the fact that only a handful of companies can afford to build the best AI infrastructure isn't a good thing for Nvidia. During the fiscal 2026 first quarter (ended April 27), more than half of the company's total revenue came from just four unnamed customers, which means a pullback in AI infrastructure spending from any one of them could threaten the chip giant's incredible run of growth. Let's take a look at who those top customers might be, so we can assess the sustainability of Nvidia's data center business. Image source: Getty Images. Nvidia generated $44.1 billion in totalrevenueduring the fiscal 2026 first quarter. The data center segment was responsible for $39.1 billion of that figure, so AIGPUsare now the company's most important product by far. While Nvidia doesn't disclose who its customers are, it does report some data on the concentration of its revenue base. During the first quarter, just four mystery customers alone accounted for 54% of the company's $44.1 billion in sales: Customer Proportion of Nvidia's Q1 Revenue Customer A 16% Customer B 14% Customer C 13% Customer D 11% Data source: Nvidia. That means Customer A spent around $7 billion with Nvidia during the first quarter, and there are only a handful of companies in the world with enough financial resources to keep that up. As I mentioned earlier, this creates a risk for Nvidia because if Customer A were to reduce itscapital expenditures, it would be very hard for the chipmaker to replace that revenue. It's impossible to identify Nvidia's top customers with certainty, but we can make some pretty reasonable assumptions based on public forecasts issued by some of the world's biggest tech companies: Several otherAIcompanies have smaller -- but not insignificant -- capital investments in the pipeline.Oracle, for example, recently told investors it will increase its data center spending to over $25 billion during its fiscal year 2026 (which just began on June 1). Then there are top AI start-ups likeOpenAI, Anthropic, andElon Musk'sxAI, which also have very deep pockets. While all of the above companies are developing AI for their own purposes, Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet are also three of the world's largest providers ofcloud services. In other words, they build the centralized data centers I mentioned earlier, which they rent to AI developers for a profit. Despite the exorbitant amount of AI infrastructure spending on the table this year, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang thinks this is just the beginning. He predicts capital expenditures could top $1 trillionper yearby 2028, because every new generation of AI models requires more computing capacity than the last. For example, Huang says some of the newest \"reasoning\" models consume up to1,000 times more computing capacity than their predecessors. These models spend time \"thinking\" in the background before rendering responses, ensuring they produce more accurate information than traditional largelanguage models(LLMs), which generate fast, one-shot responses. Nvidia's Blackwell and Blackwell Ultra GPU architectures were designed to meet the growing demand for inference capacity from reasoning models, which is why chips like the GB200 and GB300 are the most sought-after in the world. If Huang is right about the trajectory of AI infrastructure spending, then the risks associated with Nvidia's highly concentrated revenue probably won't materialize for at least a few more years. SinceNvidia stock is trading at a relatively attractive valuationright now, those potential risks probably shouldn't keep investors from buying it right now.",

Only one other stock --Microsoft-- boasts a double-digit gainso farthis year.Nvidia, the hottest stock of the last five years, has only generated a return of 6% as of this writing. So, is Meta now the best AI stock around? Let's take a closer look. Image source: Getty Images. First, let'sget one thing clear: Meta spentbigon AI. We're talking tens of billions of dollars, with tens of billions more to come over the next few years.The company spent lavishly on themetaverse,but alsoonAI infrastructure anddata centers. Of course, simply spending money doesn't guarantee a return. However, Meta's AI spending now appears far more focused thanit didin years past.Specifically, the companyhas a planto fully automate ad creation and placement across its suite of platformssuchas Facebook and Instagramby2026. Thiscould represent a revolution in how adsare createdand how ad campaignsare run. In theory, Meta could cut out ad agencymiddlementhat charge lavish fees before an ad ever reaches a customer. Furthermore, Meta could use its enormous trove of user data to personalize ads, potentially increasing the return on investment for ad buyers. In addition to its AI-powered ads strategy, Meta has other bullish catalystson its side. Take its Threads product, which competes with X (formerly known as Twitter). Meta's Threadsis now attracting320 million to 350 million monthly active users (MAUs). That's up from about 150 million a year ago. Image source:Statista Combine Meta's AI initiatives with the growth of Threads and the company's excellent first-quarter results, and Wall Street is turning even more bullish on shares of Meta. Analystsfrom major firms, includingBank of AmericaandRBCraised theirprice targetsfor Meta's stock recently.These analysts pointed to better-than-expected first-quarter earningsalong withMeta's AI initiativesas reasons for raisingtheir price targets. To begin with, it's important to note that Meta Platforms might not be a stock for every investor or portfolio. While Meta is an excellent company and has a bright future ahead of it, its stock still boasts a rich valuation that might put it out of reach for value investors. For example, itsprice-to-sales (P/S)ratio is 10x. That's not unheard of within the tech sector, but it remains far above the average P/S ratio of around 2x-3x. Moreover, Meta's P/S ratio of 10x is even higher than some of its peers.Alphabet, for example, sports a much lower P/S ratio of only 6x. All that said, Meta remains a solid choice for investors looking for an AI stock. After all, just like anything else, you pay up for quality, and Meta is a quality business that continues to execute at a high level. Moreover, if the company can deliver on its AI initiatives -- including AI-powered ads -- I believe its stock could soar in the coming years. For me, that makes Meta an AI stock to consider right now.",

        "content": "Shares in chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) rose nearly 2% on Monday, closing at $144.69 (\u00a3106.66) each,around just 3% off its record high. The latest advance in shares comes after Nvidia held its GPU Technology Conference (GTC) in Paris last week, alongside this year's VivaTech conference, and CEO Jensen Huang also attended London Tech Week. Huang shared how Nvidia is working with countries across the continent to develop artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure. Read more:FTSE 100 LIVE: Markets volatile as Trump leaves G7 early amid further Iran-Israel strikes At the start of London Tech Week on Monday, Huang said the UK has \"one of the richest AI communities anywhere on the planet\" and said that it was an \"incredible place to invest\", adding that he would invest in the country. The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announced on Monday that it waslaunching a \"supercharged sandbox\", in collaboration with Nvidia to allow City firms to experiment with AI. On Friday, Nvidia shared that Huang had met with German chancellor Friedrich Merz to discuss new partnerships \"poised to bring breakthrough innovations on the world\u2019s first industrial AI cloud\". Meanwhile, Chinese state broadcaster CCTV reported on Tuesday thatNvidia is set to attend a major supply-chain expoin Beijing in July for the first time. A spokesperson for Nvidia had not responded toYahoo Finance UK's request for comment at the time of writing. Fellow chipmaker AMD (AMD) jumped nearly 9% on Monday, which came afterPiper Sandler lifted their price targeton the stock to $140. Piper Sandler said it expected to see a snapback in its graphics processing unit (GPU) area of the business. The investment bank highlighted enthusiasm about recent product announcements, saying they were \"pivotal\" for growth in the GPU industry. Read more:Oil jumps as traders fear supply disruption amid Israel-Iran conflict Piper Sandler also noted that AMD was working through its China-related issues and that its fourth quarter looked promising following a pre-quarter close call on Friday. For the second quarter, AMD has said it expects revenue to be approximately $7.4bn, plus or minus $300m. That would be in line with the $7.4bn in revenue the chipmaker reported in the first quarter. In the UK, BP (BP.L) was the biggest riser on FTSE 100 (^FTSE) on Tuesday morning, rising nearly 2%, as oil prices continued to surge driven by concerns about disruption to supply as a result of the conflict between Iran and Israel. Brent crude futures (BZ=F) jumped 1.8% on Tuesday morning, hitting $74.51 a barrel, its highest point since early April. Stocks:Create your watchlist and portfolio Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \"There are a lot of eyes on the oil markets \u2014 not just for geopolitical reasons but for their broader economic impact. \"Energy prices remain a crucial piece of the inflation puzzle, and falling oil had been a cornerstone of the US President\u2019s pressure campaign to nudge the Fed toward rate cuts. With oil climbing again, that strategy faces new headwinds.\" Shares in Ashtead (AHT.L) hovered just below the flatline on Tuesday morning, after the UK-listed industrial equipment rental maker posted a dip in profits. Ashtead said revenue dipped 1% to $10.79bn in the 2025 fiscal year, according to results released on Tuesday. Profit before tax for the year fell 5% to just under $2bn. Read more:Stocks that are trending today However, Ashtead said its board was recommending a final dividend of $0.72 per share, making the payout for the year $1.08, which is an increase of 3% on the previous year. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell (AJB.L), said: \"It may have endured a sticky spell over the last 12 months but one area in which Ashtead has regularly delivered for shareholders is on dividends. \u201cIn its last set of results as a FTSE 100 (^FTSE) company, before it moves its primary listing to New York and changes its name to Sunbelt, it remained true to this tradition as it hiked the dividend yet again.\" Another stock in focus on the London market was Legal & General (LGEN.L), after the financial services firm said it had made a \"good start to 2025\" and was on track to deliver results in line with its three-year targets. L&G said it expected group core operating earnings per share to grow by between 6% and 9% in 2025.

L&G said it also planned to grow private markets assets under management to \u00a385bn+ by 2028, which would compare to \u00a357bn in 2024.

Shares of Nvidia climbed nearly 2% to $144.7 on Monday, putting the stock within 3% of its all-time closing high after a multi-week rebound. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. Analyst Tom O'Malley increased his compute revenue estimate to $37 billion, up from $35.6 billion, and now sees Q3 and Q4 revenue at $42 billion and $48 billion, respectively. Those projections are ahead of Wall Street's forecasts of $40.8 billion and $46.2 billion. O'Malley said Nvidia's Blackwell chip production hit 30,000 wafers per month in June. That's below the expected 40,000, but utilization remains healthy, with strong supply chain support. He added that Blackwell Ultra is still on track for mass production in Q3, with initial shipments expected by quarter's end. Average selling prices were revised to $35,000 for the second half. System sales are projected to make up 25% of July revenue and could reach 50% by October. Nvidia has also expanded sovereign AI deals in the Middle East, including with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, during President Trump's regional visit.

YCharts We analyzed thestocksthat performed the best during Trump\u2019s presidency based on their total return for the period dating from Jan. 20, 2017, to Jan. 20, 2021.

Total return: ~2,300% Shopify (SHOP) ranks just behind Trade Desk for growth during this period, notching a gain of more than 2,300%. Between 2017 and 2021, the price went from $5.01 to $119.67. Shopify is a platform where business owners can launch digital or brick-and-mortar stores.It experienced a huge boost in revenue during the COVID-19 pandemic. With physical retail stores shut down due to lockdowns, customers flocked to online retailers to shop on the e-commerce platform.In 2020, the company announced $2.4 billion worth of Black Friday sales, a 75% increase over the previous year. Total return: ~1,630% Elon Musk\u2019s Tesla (TSLA) stood out during Trump\u2019s first term, rising from just $16.32 to $282.21, a gain of more than 1,700%. The U.S.-based electric vehicle maker joined the S&P 500 in 2020 after posting five straight quarters of profitability, becoming one of the largest companies to be included in the index. In 2020, Tesla reported $31.5 billion in revenue, up from $24.6 billion in 2019. Contributing factors included elevated demand for EVs in China, continued production despite the pandemic, and its sale of regulatory credits, all helped boost sales.In January 2021, Musk was anointed therichest person in the world, according to Bloomberg. Total return: ~1,000% MercadoLibre (MELI), often dubbed the \"Amazon of South America,\" saw its stock climb from $176.17 to $1,965.05 from 2017 to 2020, accounting for a more than 1,000% increase. The Argentina-based company operatese-commerceplatforms in Latin American countries, including Mexico, the Dominican Republic, Colombia, and Venezuela. The COVID-19 pandemic buoyed the company\u2019s stock as shoppers began purchasing more goods online. In 2020, MercadoLibre\u2019s e-commerce revenue increased 90%.And while the company\u2019s e-commerce division is an integral part of the business, the company also owns Mercado Pago, afintech armthat generatesrevenuefrom payment processing andpoint-of-salepurchases. The Trump-erabull marketcreated standout winners, especially in tech, clean energy, and e-commerce. Companies that adapted quickly to changing consumer behavior during the pandemic, or offered scalable digital solutions, saw exponential growth. While these returns are extraordinary, they were shaped by a unique mix of policy, pandemic-driven shifts, and investor optimism.",

On Tuesday, the cloud computing giant introduced the Oracle Defense Ecosystem, which it says is designed to connect technology companies with government clients to help them meet federal compliance standards. \u201cNational security teams are often unable to access the latest cloud and AI technologies,\u201d Oracle said, pointing to \u201ccomplex procurement processes, strict qualification standards, and the relationship networks required.\u201d Ecosystem members will be able to work with Oracle\u2019s sales teams and utilize the company\u2019s cloud marketplace, the company said. They\u2019ll also be able to access AI software developed by Palantir (PLTR), a technology firm that has seen its stock surge this year as itsgovernment connectionshave expanded. Palantir\u2019s Foundry software has been integrated with at least four U.S. agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Health and Human Services, according to reports. Oracle's own government bona fides include its involvement inStargate, a joint venture with OpenAI and SoftBank to build AI infrastructure in the U.S. In January, the companies said they would commit $100 billion to start, and as much as $500 billion over the next four years.

        "content": "In this podcast, Motley Fool host Anand Chokkavelu and contributors Lou Whiteman and Rick Munarriz discuss: To catch full episodes of all The Motley Fool's free podcasts, check out ourpodcast center. When you're ready to invest, check outthis top 10 list of stocks to buy. A full transcript is below. This podcast was recorded on June 11, 2025. Anand\u202fChokkavelu:Are we talking about the hottest stock in the market? Motley Fool Money starts now. I'm Anand Chokkavelu, and I'm joined by two of my favorite fools, Lou Whiteman and Rick Munarriz. Today, we're talking about a Shopify lawsuit lodged by another Fool's favorite. We'll bring out the hype meter on anNVIDIA-related stock, and we'll pick today's most interesting earnings. Before we dive into the rest of today's show, here are a few headlines on our radar. Inflation is still in check. The latest CPI reading has inflation at 2.4% with help from items like lower gas prices. In inflation adjacent news, the details are always morphing, but the China and US trade talks are trending with a green arrow, we'll say. Open AI is adding Google Cloud to help power ChatGPT, a shift from exclusively usingMicrosoftAzure and a win forGoogle's Cloud business. Upgrade ChatGPT from an enemy to a frenemy. The ChatGPT still threatens Google's search business. This week,Starbucksis hosting its annual leadership conference in Vegas as it keeps its back to Starbucks' aim of getting me my tall decaf Americano in four minutes or less. On earnings, we had a few notable ones from the Fool Universe.GitLab, Stitch Fix, andChewyare all down sizably today. Lou, I'll give you the choice, which is the most interesting. Lou\u202fWhiteman:We have a dog in our life, so my gaze naturally falls on Chewy. You're right, Chewy's down big. They're down about 10% right now. It was actually a really solid quarter. Earnings per share were just above expectations. Revenue is up 8% from last year and a little better than what Wall Street had expected. Active customers grew by almost 4% from a year ago, and those customers are spending more. They're spending about $583 annually, which is up 3.7% from a year ago. The issue, if there is an issue, well, guidance. Chewy is forecasting revenue growth to slow slightly in the current quarter to about 7.5% at the midpoint and full year sales of about 12.3 billion to 12.45 billion. That is at the midpoint. It's a bit of a downside to the $12.4 billion consensus. But, Rick, it feels to me like this is a lot more to do with macro uncertainty and what's going on with the consumer than it does anything specific to Chewy. Stocks are not cheap. Trying to get 33 times future earnings, but the growth story at Chewy appears to be intact, and that's what investors are looking for. Rick\u202fMunarriz:One of the more frustrating things about watching Chewy in recent years was seeing its active customer base slide from 2021 all the way to 2023. It closed down 2021 with 20.7 million active customers, only default to 20.4 million active shoppers in 2022, and 20.1 million in 2023. It bounced back to 20.5 million by the end of last year, and now it's back above 20.7. That's great. Chewy played dead, and then it rolled over out of stock. But I think it has a much better report than the market's response is suggesting. The shares, they were on a tear heading into the Fresh Financials. They almost doubled over the past year. Sometimes that stock can be priced for perfection. See what I did there? Anand\u202fChokkavelu:I saw it, Rick. Every time we talk Chewy, I think about pets.com, maybe being 20 years too soon in the hype cycle, which brings us to our next segment, the hype meter, right after this break. It's time for the hype meter. Rick, you've spent a career trying to separate the future MAG 7s from the Pretenders. We've got an AI hyperscalar that's backed by NVIDIA. Core Weave IPOed in late March, and as you might guess, when you mix words like AI and NVIDIA seal of approval, its stock has quadrupled in less than three months. The hypemeter goes from a 1990s eraAmazonat a 1 to a pandemic era celebrity back SPAC at 10. A one is believed the hype and gets some money in now, and a 10, this is all hype. Run away. What are you ranking Core weave? Rick\u202fMunarriz:I'm going with a three, and I wish I could go higher. This company has one of the most punchable face origin stories you'll ever hear. It started eight years ago with a couple of hedge fund Bros who bought GPUs to mineEthereumas a hobby. They're cryptodude, and then Core Weave was initially called the Atlantic Crypto Corporation. When the crypto market crashed a couple of years later, Atlanta Crypto, they shifted gears and became Core Weave. It took advantage of the pullback and digital currencies to snap up GPUs from failed crypto mining companies like they were doing, and then refreshing its business model to use its growing arsenal of graphic chips and an infrastructure playground catering to special effects companies and generative AI start-ups. Getting in on the ground floor of an emerging industry can be pretty sweet, and Core Weave's business, it's booming. It generated 1.9 billion in revenue last year. It's on track to top 5 billion this year. Analysts see Core Weave's top line clocking in more than 11 billion next year, 16 billion in 2027, and more than 21 billion in 2028. Put another way, Core Weave's annual revenue is expected to soar tenfold in the next four years. Talk about putting the hyper or the hype in hyperscaling. But it's losing money, and the deficits do keep widening. However, analysts see Core Weave turning profitable on an adjusted basis next year and on a reported basis the following year. There are two things I think that can trip Core Weave up at this point. The first Microsoft accounted for 62% of its business last year, and I don't think that's a big deal. Clearly, Core Weave's client base is going to grow beyond Microsoft Copilot and ChatGPT as the AI boom tosses out a bigger net. The other potential trip up does bear watching. Offering up a cloud based infrastructure platform, and it's building out data centers while also leasing capacity elsewhere is going to attract a lot of new competitors in the coming years. Is Core Weave differentiated enough to stand out, or is it just another commodity market in the making, something that the founders know all too well from their energy trading days? The amazing thing here is that Core Weave went public at 40 in late March, as you said, and for the first few weeks, you could have bought the shares in the mid 30s. In less than three months on the market, it has gone from a broken IPO to a four bagger only in New Jersey. Lou, any thoughts on Core weave or, like, a lot of us a few months ago, did you just think this was the name of a Pilates workout? Lou\u202fWhiteman:It's a legs day for me. It's not a Core weave day. Look, I'll say this. I love equipment leasing businesses. I love the economics of these businesses. I have a lot of net worth tied up in aircraft lessers, but it works with aircrafts because airplanes, they have 50 year lives. I'm concerned about this model like loading up on debt to buy GPUs, which become outdated basically the second they're installed. That would be my big caution. Just watch the debt, watch the growth and hopefully this can keep running, but there is some risk with just taking on all these GPUs, they get old quick. Anand\u202fChokkavelu:Either be buying Core Weave? Lou\u202fWhiteman:Not me. Rick\u202fMunarriz:Not yet. Unfortunately, I didn't buy it back in March when I could have gotten it as the broken IPO, so watching sadly from the sidelines, but interested, intrigued. Anand\u202fChokkavelu:Right on. But you rated at three, so that's very low hype, so something [inaudible 00:08:01] . Rick\u202fMunarriz:I think it's living up to the hype. Yes, a low score. Anand\u202fChokkavelu:Lou, have I heard right that two full favorites are fighting? Lou\u202fWhiteman:You did hear right. Sezzle, who is a really interesting player in the buy now later space. They filed a lawsuit, antitrust lawsuit against Shopify, alleging that Shopify is engaging in monopolistic and anti-competitive practices to limit buy now pay later competition on its platform. Got to read into that to limit Sezzle. Look, I have a lot of respect for Sezzle, but I read this suit, and my reaction was, Come on, man. I don't get it. Sezzle isn't being excluded from Shopify. In fact, about 5% of Sezzle's revenue comes from Shopify. The complaint seems to be that someone other than Sezzle is the preferred by now pay later option on Shopify. Look, we'll see how it plays out. I'm not a lawyer. I'm not playing one on a podcast, but I don't think the courts should care that Shopify is a preferred vendor. Feels like this is a Sezzle's problem. For years, retailers have chosen not to take Amex cards or to charge fees if you pay in certain ways. It feels like the same thing to me here, guys. I don't see why Shopify should be stopped from basically doing what others have done, which is working with a preferred partner. You know what? I think the market agrees. The day this was announced, Shopify's stock was up, and Sezzle fell. I don't know. That's not the jury, but it is a jury, I think. Rick\u202fMunarriz:If Shopify feels that it's about to lose the legal as the legal process plays out, it can always turn to Sezzle to settle now pay later, SNPL. Lou\u202fWhiteman:There you go.

Nvidia has been Wall Street\u2019s number one growth stock darling of the last decade, but companies focused on growth reinvest their profits instead of distributing them as shareholder dividends, right? Most, but not all. Per Nasdaq, Nvidia began paying modestdividendsin mid-2013, so investors who jumped on board in mid-2015 would have been reaping or reinvesting them for the last decade, a period of extraordinary growth for the company. Here\u2019s how your $10,000 would have grown over the last 10 years had you harvested your dividends as income.

However, calculating long-term gains with a DRIP (dividend reinvestment plan) is more complex and inexact because dividend yields fluctuate over time, which affects the number of shares that can be purchased with each reinvestment, as does the stock\u2019s always-changing purchase price at the time of the reinvestment. Also, growing companies often issue stock splits, which change the number and value of a giveninvestor\u2019sshares. Therefore, the calculation must rely on averages and close estimates.

        "content": "Wedbush Securities\u2019 first ETF,Dan Ives Wedbush AI Revolution ETFIVES, made a stunning debut, surpassing $100 million in assets under management (AUM) within its first five trading days. Launched on June 4, IVES is an actively managed ETF focused purely on artificial intelligence companies. The rapid inflows highlight increased demand for AI exposure. IVES seeks to capitalize on the rapid growth of artificial intelligence by investing in companies poised to lead the AI transformation. This fund offers investors exposure to a diversified portfolio of firms at the cutting edge of AI technology. The Dan IVES Wedbush AI Revolution ETF tracks the Solactive Wedbush Artificial Intelligence Index.The ETF is well diversified across 30 stocks, with each firm making up for no more than a 5.7% share. Microsoft MSFT, NVIDIA NVDA and Broadcom AVGO are the top three holdings in the fund\u2019s basket. Further, IVES offers diversified exposure across key AI segments \u2014 semiconductors, hyperscalers, cybersecurity, cloud, robotics, and consumer platforms \u2014 reflecting a multi-trillion dollar AI investment boom (read:\u00a0ETFs Poised to Win in the MSFT vs. NVDA Market Cap Battle).The new ETF has an expense ratio of 0.75%, higher than large-cap tech ETFs like QQQ (0.20%) but reasonable for a thematic strategy. Wedbush\u2019s entry into the ETF market comes at an opportune moment when AI enthusiasm has renewed among investors after a slowdown early in the year. AI-related stocks, especially NVIDIA, Microsoft and Tesla (TSLA), have been on a strong rally in recent weeks, with some up about 20% in the past month. Unlike most thematic ETFs that rely heavily on passive screens or rules-based criteria, IVES is built on the active insights of veteran tech analyst Dan Ives, Wedbush\u2019s Managing Director and Head of Technology Research. The ETF\u2019s portfolio is based on Ives' proprietary \u201cAI 30\u201d list \u2014 a curated basket of companies he believes are best positioned to lead and benefit from the artificial intelligence revolution (read:\u00a0Investing in the AI Revolution with Dan Ives). Many AI ETFs focus primarily on one segment of the AI value chain \u2014 often just big-cap platform companies like NVIDIA or Alphabet. IVES, however, adopts a comprehensive strategy that captures the entire AI ecosystem. IVES deliberately limits concentration risk. The fund caps individual holdings at relatively balanced weights, with each holding around 5% to 6%. This strategy ensures that returns are not overly reliant on just a handful of stocks. It gives smaller, high-growth companies meaningful representation while still maintaining exposure to established leaders. The result is a more diversified and potentially resilient portfolio, especially important in the volatile world of tech investing. The global AI market is undergoing remarkable growth, fueled by key drivers such as the widespread adoption of digital technologies, increasing awareness about AI\u2019s potential and the rising demand for convenient online services. This rapid expansion is further propelled by major advancements in AI robotics, autonomous systems, sensor technology, computer vision, machine learning, natural language processing and generative AI.A new UN Trade and Development (UNCTAD) report projects the global AI market to soar from $189 billion in 2023 to $4.8 trillion by 2033, representing a 25-fold increase in just a decade. Per Grand View Research, the global AI market is expected to witness a compound annual growth rate of 35.9% from 2025 to 2030 to reach $1,811.75 billion by 2030. Statista projects that the AI market will reach $244.22 billion in 2025 and $1.01 trillion by 2031 at a CAGR (2025-2031) of 26.60%. Though the AI theme space is a bit crowded, there is scope for Dan Ives Wedbush AI Revolution ETF due to its strategic structure and diversification. The new ETF would face fierce competition fromGlobal X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETFAIQ,iShares Future AI & Tech ETFARTY andDefiance Quantum ETFQTUM, which manage billions in AUM each. With more than $100M in assets, the market sees potential for IVES. Whether IVES becomes a top-tier AI ETF will depend on its long-term performance relative to both broader indices and other thematic funds.

        "header": "Cathie Wood Goes Bargain Hunting: 3 Stocks She Just Bought",
        "content": "This is the ideal market environment for Cathie Wood. Stocks are rallying, and the founder, CEO, and chief investment officer of the Ark Invest family of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is at her best when high-beta stocks are moving higher. She kicked off the week by purchasing four different stocks. I want to talk about three of them. Wood added to existing stakes inNvidia(NVDA-0.41%),DoorDash(DASH-1.05%), andNextdoor Holdings(KIND4.52%)on Monday. Let's take a closer look at Wood's latest purchases. Every starting line tells a different story when it comes to the developer of graphics processing units andartificial intelligence(AI) chips. Thankfully for investors, nearly all of them end in success. Nvidia is a 15-bagger over the past five years, an 8-bagger over three years, and the shares have soared 67% since bottoming out two months ago. Zoom out a bit from the last starting line and the returns start to look more mortal. Nvidia is up a pedestrian 10% over the past year with a mere 8% year-to-date advance. It's probably still a relative victory for the \"Magnificent Seven\" stock that's also the country's second most valuable publicly traded company by market cap. Nvidia and other stocks riding high on the demand for AI chips and data center buildouts have had a couple of hits this year. The first blow came in January when Chinese AI tech start-upDeepSeek announcedthat it was generating quality generative AI with dated Nvidia chips for a lot less than Western rivals. That was followed by the trade war that restricted the sale of chips into China, resulting inbillions in charges-- and rising -- for Nvidia. Image source: Getty Images. This doesn't mean that Nvidia stock has been rising while its fundamentals are shifting to reverse. Revenue soared 69% to $44.1 billion inlast month's quarterly update, better than the 65% jump that investors were expecting for the fiscal first quarter. A 73% surge in data center revenue -- now accounting for more than 88% of the period's top line -- led the way. Adjusted earnings increased 57% to $0.96 per share, also exceeding market forecasts. Its outlook for the current quarter includes an $8 billion revenue hit on the recent export control limitations between the U.S. and China. However, analysts still would go on to jack up their profit targets for this fiscal year as well as fiscal 2027. Despite the stock's run over the last two months, Nvidia is trading for 34 times this year's projected earnings and 25 times next year's mark. This is a discount to its growth rate, even if the pace will inevitably slow in the coming quarters. Investors fortunate enough to grab some shares at the April low got in at what is now just 15 times next fiscal year's profit target. If you figured economic concerns would find folks spending less on restaurant food -- and much less paying a third-party app a premium to have it delivered -- think again. DoorDash saw its revenue rise 21%in the first quarter. Total orders have risen 18% over the past year. Profitability was a concern when DoorDash went public five years ago, but it has now been in the black for the last three quarters. DoorDash is making its own luck. It continues to broaden its offerings beyond restaurant takeout. It's also made fleet improvements to speed up deliveries and broaden its reach. On that front, it acquired European delivery specialist Deliveroo as well as restaurant reservations booker SevenRooms earlier this year. I guess it's not just DoorDash customers who are hungry these days. Most investors probably don't even know that hyperlocal online forum Nextdoor that connects 46 million weekly active users is public. It's been a bit of a dud since it went public as aspecial purpose acquisition company (SPAC)four years ago. The shares have plummeted roughly 80% in that time. Revenue growth has slowed considerably since its market debut, failing to top 13% growth in each of the last three years. The platform operator has also yet to turn profitable. However, it is flush with $418 million in cash -- accounting for about two-thirds of its current market cap -- with no long-term debt. A value play isn't typical for Wood as an aggressive growth investor, but she's been building her position up in Nextdoor aggressively over the past two months. Does she think juicy neighborhood gossip is on the rise? She obviously thinks that the stock itself will eventually be on the rise.",

        "content": "Investors think the future is looking brighter than it has in months, according to a recent Bank of America survey. The BofA Global Fund Manager Survey's investor sentiment index rose to 3.3 in June, its highest reading since March, before President Donald Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs sparked fear of a global trade war.(Note, the survey was conducted between June 6 and 12, after the U.S.-China trade d\u00e9tente, but before the recent escalation ofhostilities in the Middle East.) The fund managers surveyed by BofA reduced theircashlevels to a three-month low while significantly upping their allocations to emerging market equities, as well as energy and bank stocks. They slightly increased their allocations to U.S. stocks, but remain netunderweight. Investors are most overweight Eurozone stocks, whichgot a boostearlier this year from the announcement of fiscal stimulus in Germany, the bloc's largest economy, and a pivot out of U.S. stocks in the wake of heightened trade uncertainty. When asked what they expected to be the best-performing asset class in the next five years, 54% of respondents said international stocks, compared with just 23% indicating U.S. stocks, signaling a major shift in expectations after more than a decade of U.S. outperformance. Nonetheless, investors think the outlook for the global economy has improved markedly in recent months. A net 36% of respondents said a global recession in the next year was unlikely; just two months ago, a net 42% said a recession was likely. The share of respondents saying they expect the global economy to achieve asoft landingin the next 12 months rose to 66% from 61% in May and 37% in April. Granted, investors still aren't entirely optimistic. A net 46% of global fund manager respondents are expecting a weaker economy in the next 12 months, and 75% of respondents expect the global economy to struggle withstagflationover the same period. The improved economic backdrop and a stronger-than-expectedfirst-quarter earnings seasonhave investors bullish on corporate finances. For the first time since the end of 2015, more respondents said company balance sheets are underleveraged thanoverleveraged. As such, when asked what they hoped executives would do with excess cash over the next 12 months, more said \"return cash to shareholders\" via dividends orbuybacksthan at any other point since July 2013. One asset for which the future isn't looking so bright is the dollar. Investors have trimmed their exposure to the greenback to such an extent this year that as of June they're the most underweight since January 2005. TheU.S. Dollar Index(DXY) hasdeclined more than 9%since the start of the year, putting it on track to notch its worst first half in more than two decades. The dollar's decline has coincided with the rise of the \"Sell America\" trade, which is effectively theshunning of U.S. assetsby international investors unnerved by President Trump's hostility toward the global financial order underpinned by the dollar.",

Huang said if the U.S. pulls back, companies likeHuaweicould fill the gap. Huawei will have China covered, he said, suggesting controls could accelerate China's self-sufficiency in semiconductors and AI. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. The warning comes amid U.S.China trade tensions. Tariffs on Chinese imports reached elevated levels before easing to around 55% after recent agreements. These measures have drawn retaliation from Beijing and weigh on the U.S. economy. The World Bank now expects U.S. growth to slow to about 1.4% in 2025, and the OECD has trimmed its outlook for major economies as trade frictions persist. Consumers may face higher costs due to tariffs. Huang noted that export curbs could reduce Nvidia's revenue from China, limiting funding for research and development and potentially affecting its competitive edge over rivals.

Quantum Computing (QUBT) shares are up more than 56% in the past month, andothers in the space have also ripped higher. \"The commonalities are they're speculative,\" Interactive Brokers chief markets strategist Steve Sosnick said in an interview. \"They're momentum-driven, and they almost always have some sort of tech veneer to them.\" With the S&P 500 (^GSPC) back near record highs,the common pillars of the current three-year bull markethave clearly returned in markets. Two of the most popular AI trades, Palantir (PLTR) and Nvidia (NVDA),are back to trading near all-time highs. \"It's kind of a freight train,\" Sosnick said. \"Remember one of the great adages, 'the trend is your friend'? Well, people seem to be doing very well by following trends.\" The momentum trade isn't a new phenomenon and hasreappeared time and againduring the S&P 500's nearly 70% run since the October 2022 lows. But it'sthe latest in a string of signsthat market sentiment has recovered significantly from the height of April's tariff turmoil. In Bank of America's latest Global Fund Manager Survey, 66% of investors said they believe the global economy will achieve a \"soft landing,\" in which inflation falls to the Fed's 2% target without an outright downturn in economic activity. The eight-month high among respondents believing a soft landing is in sight comes asrecession probabilities have tumbled over the past month, while consumers'worst fears about a tariff-driven inflation spike have also subsided. BofA's global chief investment strategist Michael Hartnett wrote that the survey showed \"investor sentiment back to pre-Liberation Day 'Goldilocks bull' levels.\" But as is often the case when consensus begins to swing heavily in one direction, some believe the current market leadership could be ripe for change. In a note to clients on Monday, Julian Emanuel argued for investors to seek \"valor in valuation\" as the summer approaches, with investors closely watching for updates on Trump's tariffs and whether or not they could disrupt economic growth. Emanuel pointed out that the \"attractive valuation\" factor, including stocks like Verizon (VZ) and Tyson Foods (TSN), has lagged the \"expensive\" factor, which includes names like Coinbase (COIN), DraftKings (DKNG), Tesla (TSLA), and Strategy (MSTR). The 10.3% underperformance from the value group marks the seventh-worst rolling one-month average for that cohort of stocks against the expensive bucket since 1990, per Emanuel's work. Emanuel added that this trend typically reverses with the valuation factor seeing a 100% positive return in five prior instances of extreme underperformance with an average return of 33.5% over the next 12 months, adding: \"[The] valuation factor has value again as the 'whoosh' off the low is set to pause.\" Josh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "While you might hear friends or coworkers obsess over their401(k) performanceand brag about double-digit returns, should you rush to join them before you have anemergency fund set up? There are good arguments for both choices. ButStoy Hall,\u00a0CEO and founder of the financial planning firm Black Mammoth, told Investopedia that people should build their emergency fund first. \"If you don\u2019t have at least three to six months of expenses set aside, investing is premature,\" he said. Building up a few months of expenses inemergency savingsbefore aggressively funding retirement accounts will help prevent you from cannibalizing your future wealth during temporary setbacks. But if you don't need those emergency funds anytime soon, you will likely miss out onsignificant long-term gainsin your retirement account. If you run into an emergency situation and need cash quickly, an emergency fund is more useful than a 401(k). Early 401(k) withdrawals \u2014 before age 59.5\u2014 typically cost you 10% in penalties plus your regular income tax rate.If you're in the 12% tax bracket and withdraw $5,000 for an emergency, you'll have $1,500 taken off the top in taxes or penalties. That includes $1,000 automatically withheld for federal taxes, $250 of which you should eventually get back as a refund, and anearly withdrawal penaltyof $500. Your emergency fund, meanwhile, would give you immediate access to every dollar you've saved. Your 401(k) returns depend entirely on market conditions you can't control. The S&P 500 index, a benchmark used to discuss the ups and downs of the market overall, gained 24% in 2023, but lost 19% in 2022. Meanwhile, your emergency fund, which could be earning 4% in ahigh-yield savings account, can provide consistent, guaranteed growth, regardless of market chaos. This reliability becomes crucial during economic downturns. Job losses often coincide with market crashes\u2014exactly when your 401(k) balance is at its lowest. An emergency fund protects you from thedouble punch of unemploymentand portfolio losses. Drawing from an emergency fund instead of a 401(k) keeps you from selling at the worst moment, when the market is at a bottom. Our calculations indicate that a $10,000 401(k) withdrawal at age 35 could result in about $164,000 in lost retirement wealth by age 65, assuming the average returns for the S&P 500 since 2000 (about 10%). On the other hand, never investing that $10,000 in the first place and diverting it to emergency savings would result in a similar loss. To be sure, delaying retirement contributions also comes with significant costs. You won't benefit from employer matching, which represents a risk-free gain, and you will likely forego years of compounded returns. While an early withdrawal penalty would sting in the event of an emergency, so, too, would watching the S&P 500 climb higher every year before you're able to get any money invested. And the taxes saved on the earnings that went into the 401(k) should roughly offset the taxes you pay when making an early withdrawal\u2014unless your income has risen sharply. Savings accounts can return as much as 4% as of May 2025, but rates were far lower for most of the past two decades, as the stock market was steadily climbing. That means your money won't grow nearly as quickly in an emergency fund as it would in a retirement account. Deciding how to prepare for afinancial emergencyisn't much fun, and the ultimate decision comes down to personal choice. Some people may feel more comfortable having cash easily at hand, while others prefer to let their money work harder. For some, maybe a balance of cash and investment makes the most sense.",

        "content": "CoreWeave (CRWV) stock jumped over 8% on Tuesday, bringing the AI cloud company's post-IPO rally to a whopping 340% after Bank of America analyst Brad Sills downgraded the stock but set his price target on shares to a new Street high. On Monday, Sills downgraded CoreWeave stock to Neutral from his previous Buy rating, citing its high valuation. He noted that CoreWeave is trading at 27 times its projected 2027 earnings and highlighted its significant debt. \"Historically, CoreWeave has funded 85% of capex with debt,\" Sills wrote in a note to clients on Monday. CoreWeave isset to spend up to $23 billionin 2025, a figure that surprised Wall Street analysts and sent the stock down in May immediately following its first-ever earnings report as apublic company. Despite the downgrade, Sills raised his price outlook on the stock to $185 from $76, the highest among Wall Street analysts tracked by Bloomberg. Sills cited capital expenditures on AI, which he said are \"still very healthy\" while arguing that the \"growth rate is peaking.\" \"[W]e see solid sustained demand in CoreWeave's AI infrastructure market,\" Sills wrote. He said AI capital expenditures are set to grow 4% in 2027 to $206 billion, but that growth is much less than the 65% jump in AI capex in 2025. \"The top-line momentum is strong, though access to debt is critical to support the business,\" he wrote. Sills cited CoreWeave's expanded deal with OpenAI (OPAI.PVT). CoreWeave in May secured a $4 billion deal with the ChatGPT maker in addition to itspreviously reported $11.9 billioncommitment from the AI startup. CoreWeave is one of the largest holders of Nvidia's (NVDA) graphics processing units and rents its data-center capacity to Big Tech firms such as Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META), as their own stores of GPUs haven't been sufficient to power their AI ambitions. CoreWeave uses its debt, borrowed at high interest rates against its store of Nvidia GPUs as collateral, to buy more Nvidia chips. Nvidia is also a major investor in and customer of the AI cloud firm. The company has added more than $64 billion to its market cap \u2014 which stood at $82.7 billion on Tuesday afternoon \u2014 since its March IPO. In a note to clients on Monday, Jefferies analyst Brent Thill also gave a nod of approval to CoreWeave, listing the company among the investing firm's top AI stocks and reiterating his $180 price target on shares. \"CRWV is the fastest growing vendor in our AI coverage ... and we believe their infrastructure has more durability than most think,\" Thill wrote. Other analysts remain skeptical. \"I believe that even in an optimistic scenario, all the cash flow from their [CoreWeave's] contract[s] goes to pay down debt, and none of it reaches the shareholders,\" DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria told Yahoo Finance in an interview Tuesday. Luria reiterated his Underperform rating on CoreWeave stock and $36 price target in a note to clients last week. Luria noted that there is somewhat of a \"concern\" around CoreWeave's massive deal with OpenAI because \"while it's [OpenAI is] an incredibly impressive company ... it's also losing a tremendous amount of money.\" \"So OpenAI will have to do a lot more capital raising in order to afford what it's committed to CoreWeave,\" he added.

        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA,Financials)received a price target upgradefrom Barclays on Monday, with analysts citing stronger-than-expected Compute segment growth and expanding Blackwell chip production. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. Barclays raised its target to $200 from $170 and maintained an Overweight rating, forecasting Nvidia will beat consensus revenue estimates by $2 billion for the July quarter. The firm now expects Q3 revenue to reach $42 billion and Q4 to hit $48 billion, compared to Wall Street's estimates of $40.8 billion and $46.2 billion, respectively. The revision comes as Blackwell chip production scales, reaching 30,000 wafers per month in June. Though below the firm's earlier forecast of 40,000, Barclays said utilization rates remain healthy and expects ramped system sales to comprise nearly half of total revenue by October. The forecast boost aligns with positive supply chain feedback and accelerating enterprise AI demand. Nvidia's collaboration with Deutsche Telekom to build Europe's first industrial AI cloud also signals geographic expansion. The project involves 10,000 chips from Nvidia and is expected to complete by 2026. Nvidia is excluding China from revenue guidance amid U.S. restrictions, CEO Jensen Huang confirmed. Competitors like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD,Financials) are stepping up AI chip efforts, with new MI350 and MI400 series launches, but analysts suggest Nvidia's ecosystem remains dominant. Investors should monitor upcoming Blackwell Ultra volumes and progress on European cloud deployments for near-term catalysts. This article first appeared onGuruFocus.",

The systems, available later this fall, will allow users to access their Xbox library on the go while offering the ability to stream games via the cloud. The moves line up with Microsoft\u2019s effort to expand its Xbox portfolio well beyond its traditional home console in an effort to build out its Game Pass subscription and cloud gaming service. Part of that strategy included buying some of the biggest gaming developers and publishers in the industry, such as its $7.5 billion acquisition of ZeniMax in 2021. The company has also released a number of its games on rival platforms, including Sony\u2019s (SONY) PlayStation. Microsoft\u2019s Game Pass, which costs between $9.99 and $19.99, depending on features, is the company's gaming storefront and online gaming service.

Piper Sandler on Monday raised itsprice targetfor the stock and expressed enthusiasm for AMD's recently unveiled Helios server rack architecture, which will combine the company's next-generation AMD MI400 chips into one larger system. The investment bank pointed out that the hardware, anticipated for release in 2026, is \"pivotal\" for the growth of AMD Instinct GPUs. Meanwhile, analysts at Bank of America speculate that the chipmaker could announce Amazon (AMZN) as a partner after the tech giant\u2019s cloud unit,Amazon Web Services (AWS), was a key sponsor of last week\u2019s event. AMD shares rose 0.6% to around $127 on Tuesday, after surging nearly 8% yesterday to pace S&P 500 advancers. The stock is up 66% from its early-April low, though has gained just 5% since the start of 2025 amid uncertainty overchip export curbsand the company's ability to capture a greater share of the lucrative AI chip market that's now dominated by Nvidia (NVDA). Below, we break down thetechnicalson AMD\u2019s chart and point out crucial price levels worth watching out for. After hitting their May high, AMD shares formed a pennant, a chart pattern that signals a continuation of the stock\u2019suptrendthat started in early April. Indeed, the stock broke out from the pattern earlier this month and staged avolume-backed close above the closely watched200-day moving averagein Monday\u2019s trading session. Moreover, therelative strength indexindicates bullish momentum, generating a reading just below the indicator\u2019s overbought threshold. Let\u2019s identify three crucial overhead areas on AMD's chart to watch and also point outsupport levelsworth monitoring. Follow-through buying could trigger an initial rally toward $145. This area may provide overhead selling pressure near severalpeaks and troughsthat formed on the chart between April and December last year. A decisive close above this crucial area may see the shares testresistancearound $160. Investors could seek tolock in profitsin this location near a trendline that connects a range of corresponding trading activity that developed on the chart from April to October last year. The next overhead area to watch sits at $175. The shares may run into sellers in this region near prominent peaks that emerged in May and October last year. Duringretracementsin the stock, it\u2019s firstly worth monitoring the $115 level. The stock could encounter support near last week\u2019s retest of the pennant pattern\u2019sbreakoutpoint, which also closely aligns with a range ofprice actionstretching back to mid-January. Finally, selling below this level opens the door for a drop to lower support around $108. Investors could seek toaccumulate AMD sharesin this location near the low of the pennant pattern and early-February low.
