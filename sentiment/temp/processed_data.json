        "content": "Alphabet's(GOOG-0.43%)(GOOGL-1.19%)Waymo unit is widely considered the front-runner in the driverless vehicle space, whileTesla(TSLA-1.71%)generates the most publicity in this realm, with its CEO touting that it will be the first to \"solve autonomy.\" But, currently, the best driverless vehicle stock isNvidia(NVDA0.35%). Theartificial intelligence(AI) technology leader isn't a pure play on autonomous vehicles, but neither is Alphabet, nor Tesla, nor most of the companies involved in this burgeoning market. Image source: Nvidia. Competition is fierce in the driverless vehicle space because this market promises to be humongous. Eventually, all the world's cars and trucks and probably most other forms of transportation will be autonomous. The big unknown iswhenfully autonomous vehicles will be legal across the United States and in other countries. Autonomous vehicle market sizes and growth projections vary a lot depending upon what's included in the market and by source. One growth projection that falls in the middle of the range between conservative and extremely optimistic is by Precedence Research, which estimates the autonomous vehicle market will reach $4.45 trillion by 2034, which equates to a blistering compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 36% over the next 10 years. Don't get hung up on exact growth projections by any single source. The main point is that regardless of what's included in the market definition (cars and trucks, just cars, just the driverless vehicle tech and not the vehicle), growth projections across sources for the next 10 years and even longer are extremely robust. Most sources peg CAGRs in the low-30 percentages to the high-30s percentages. Screenshot by author of Nvidia's presentation at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2025. Nvidia offers companies developing driverless vehicles or driverless vehicle technology in general a complete end-to-end solution. Its core offerings include: Companies can pick and choose what Nvidia tech they use in their driverless vehicle development programs. Tesla, for instance, uses Nvidia's tech for training its self-driving AI models, but doesn't use Nvidia's in-vehicle AI supercomputer. Tesla has been developing its own AI chip for inside its vehicles because the company believes it will provide it with a competitive advantage. However, many companies use all Nvidia's driverless vehicle tech offerings. Some companies, however, do not fully disclose all the AI-powered driverless tech they are using. There are two main reasons Nvidia is a fantastic way to invest in driverless vehicles: This advantage brings to mind the proverb \"a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.\" By investing in Nvidia, investors have a company that is already profiting from the driverless vehicle space, rather than a company that just has potential, no matter how great that potential might be. (Though we don't know exactly to what degree Nvidia profits because it doesn't break out its profits by categories.) Moreover, it seems highly likely that these profits will explode in size in the coming years because so many companies are developing with Nvidia's driverless vehicle tech. And a good number of them have inked well-defined partnerships that involve using Nvidia's tech inside each vehicle, or each vehicle of a certain model or models, they produce starting at a certain model year. Meanwhile, Alphabet's Waymo, Tesla,Rivian, and countless other companies arespendingmoney -- and huge sums of money, at that -- in their efforts to develop driverless vehicle technology, including for robotaxis in some cases. Sure, Tesla is generatingrevenuewhen a Tesla vehicle buyer elects to purchase its \"supervised full-self-driving\" package, but we can bet that revenue pales compared to how much it's spending developing its autonomous driving tech. Likewise, the same holds true for Waymo, which is now generating some substantial revenue from its paid robotaxi rides. As of April, it was providing more than 250,000 paid rides a week -- a fivefold increase from a year ago -- as management shared on the company's Q1 2025 earnings call. But the company's \"other bets\" category -- of which Waymo is widely assumed to be by far the largest component -- had an operating loss of $1.2 billion. Here's an extremely powerful quote from CFO Colette Kress from Nvidia's quarterly earnings call in August 2024: Automotive was a key growth driver for the quarter aseveryautomaker developing autonomous vehicle technology is using Nvidia in their data centers. [Emphasis mine.] Automotive will drivemultibillion dollarsin revenue across on-prem[ises] and cloud consumption and will grow as next-generation AV [autonomous vehicle] models require significantly more compute. Take this in:Everyautomaker that's developing driverless vehicle tech (and nearly all of them are) was using Nvidia's tech for AI training purposes as of last August. \"Every\"! This word should be music to the ears of Nvidia stock investors. Kress' \"multibillion dollars\" refers to just revenue included in the company's data center platform. It doesn't include driverless vehicle tech revenue in Nvidia's auto and robotics platform, which includes sales of DRIVE AGX. Nor does it include the Omniverse offering for simulation, as this revenue falls into the professional visualization platform. The number of companies that are developing autonomous vehicles or autonomous vehicle systems using Nvidia's tech must be in the thousands and includes automakers, truck makers, robotaxi developers, Tier 1 auto suppliers, software companies, and others. But here's a sampling of major companies that are known to be using Nvidia's autonomous vehicle tech forbothAI training and AI inferencing:Toyota(the best-selling automaker in the world),General Motors(the U.S.'s top-selling automaker),Mercedes-Benz, andVolvo Cars. Moreover, the news for Nvidia investors gets even better: Nearly every larger ChineseEV maker-- including Warren Buffett-backedBYDCompanyandNio-- has partnered with Nvidia to provide its driverless vehicle tech inside their vehicles, or at least in some models, in addition to using Nvidia's tech for AI training. These are big wins because the Chinese EV makers have recently been gaining significant EV market share in China and Europe. The more vehicles they produce, the more DRIVE supercomputers they will need to buy from Nvidia. I think it speaks volumes to the quality of Nvidia's AI-powered driverless vehicle tech that brands that have long been renowned for their focus on safety (Volvo Cars) and top-quality engineering (Mercedes-Benz) have partnered with Nvidia to put DRIVE AGX systems in their vehicles, in addition to using Nvidia's tech for training and simulation. Higher-end vehicle brands are less likely to chance using anything but what they consider the best technology in their vehicles, as their ability to get premium prices for their vehicles depends heavily on maintaining their good reputations. In short, not only is Nvidia stock the best overallAI stock, but also the best driverless vehicle stock.",

        "header": "Stock Split Watch: Is CrowdStrike Next?",
        "content": "Last year was a big one for stock splits, with some of the market's most exciting companies, fromNvidiatoBroadcomandChipotle Mexican Grill, taking part. Investors always are on the lookout for these events, and they often happen after a stock has soared over several months or years. The maneuver brings down the price of each individual share, making the stock easier for more investors to buy. So when looking for the next potential stock-split company, it's a great idea to consider recent top performers. And that brings me toCrowdStrike(CRWD2.06%), a stock that's soared nearly 50% this year to a record high of just over $500. Will CrowdStrike announce a split soon? Let's consider the evidence. Image source: Getty Images. First, though, a quick look atstock splitsthemselves. Splits happen when a company offers additional shares to current holders, but the value of the holders' total position remains the same. By doing this, the price of each individual share declines, but the market value of the company is left unchanged. In fact, nothing fundamental changes after a stock split. So if nothing really changes, why are stock splits viewed as positive? As mentioned, these operations, by lowering the per-share price, make it easier for more investors to get in on the stock. Certain investors don't have access tofractional shares, making it difficult for them to buy stocks once they reach certain levels -- for example, $500 or even $1,000. And others may see those levels as a psychological barrier, even if the stock isn't expensive from a valuation standpoint. A stock split won't lead to a pop in the share price the day of the operation, but over time, it could draw more investors to a particular stock. The second positive point is stock splits may be seen as a sign of confidence from a company's management. If management decides on a split, it's likely these leaders believe the company has what it takes to deliver more share-price growth over time. Now, let's consider the case of CrowdStrike. The cybersecurity giant has seen explosive growth since its initial public offering back in 2019, with revenue soaring into the billions of dollars, and the stock surging more than 1,300%. Customers have flocked to CrowdStrike's artificial intelligence (AI)-driven Falcon system, offered in modules that allow them to design a platform suited to their needs. In fact, the world became so dependent on CrowdStrike that last year a software update glitch led to an outage that brought much global activity to a standstill. The problem has weighed on earnings, with the company offering compensation packages to those affected, and CrowdStrike says these headwinds will continue through this fiscal year. Still, CrowdStrike has maintained solid relationships with customers and continues to deliver double-digit growth. In the latest quarter, revenue advanced 20% to more than $1 billion, and importantly, annual recurring revenue also climbed in the double digits, to $4.4 billion. Now, here's another key point that offers us reason to be confident about CrowdStrike: The company announced an authorization allowing itto buy back$1 billion in shares. A company that aims to buy its own shares generally is confident about its own outlook, but here, we're not limited to making assumptions, because Chief Executive Officer George Kurtz specifically said the \"announced share repurchase reflects our confidence in CrowdStrike's future.\" Against this backdrop, will CrowdStrike announce a split? The company hasn't yet split its stock, so such a move would be a first. Though the level of $500 isn't too intimidating for a tech stock, a stock split at this point could be a wise move for CrowdStrike, since, along with the buyback plan, it would give investors another message of confidence. On top of this, a lower price point could make it easier for the stock to advance. As mentioned, a stock split opens the door to a broader pool of potential investors. Of course, it's impossible to predict with 100% accuracy what this cybersecurity giant will decide. But at today's level, CrowdStrike is ripe for a split, and it could represent a positive move for the company.",

        "header": "These Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Are Quietly Outperforming the Market",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has dominated the stock market since the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022. At that time, theS&P 500was in a bear market following the post-pandemic hangover and a spike in inflation. But since then, the broad market index has jumped by more than 50%. By now, investors are well aware of the top-performing AI stocks likeNvidiaandPalantir, but there are other stocks that have more quietly been outperforming the market. Let's take a look at two of them. Image source: Getty Images. Upstart(UPST2.13%)was a big winner following its initial public offering (IPO) in December 2020 as the stock skyrocketed during the pandemic in 2021. However, in the bear market that followed, Upstart stock plunged 97% as rising interest rates crushed its lending business (the company operates as an AI-driven online lending platform). The stock was largely forgotten by investors, but Upstart has made a number of improvements to its business by introducing a new, more advanced AI model that has improved its conversion rates, and moving further into large lending markets like the home and auto sectors. Along the way, it's quietly staged a comeback, and the stock has jumped 175% over the last year (at the time of this writing). Upstart has more upside potential as the stock's market cap is just $6 billion, and it is trying to disrupt a massive market, competing with traditional FICO scores. According to Upstart, the company's AI-based lending model achieves significantly better results than the FICO score, and the business is growing rapidly with profitability improving. In the first quarter, revenue was up 67% to $213 million on an 89% increase in originations to $2.1 billion. It also reported a 19.1% conversion rate, up from 14% in the quarter a year ago. On the bottom line, its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) came in at $43 million, up from a loss of $20 million in the quarter a year ago. The company also expects to be profitable on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis this year. Overall, Upstart still has a large growth opportunity in front of it as credit is a massive market. If it continues to execute, the stock should outperform over the coming years, and further technology improvements could drive an inflection point in the stock. Another overlooked AI stock that is suddenly soaring isLemonade(LMND4.23%), the AI-based insurance company. Like Upstart, Lemonade had a successful IPO during the pandemic and then plunged in 2022 due to ongoing losses, slowing growth, and shifting market sentiment. However, Lemonade has now mounted a comeback on improving results and a new goal of reaching profitability by 2027. As a result, the stock is now up 160% over the last year. In particular, the stock soared last November after a strong earnings report and an Investor Day conference that pleased investors. In its most recent earnings report, Lemonade reported an acceleration in force premium growth at 27% to $1.01 billion. Total customers rose 21% to 2.55 million. Its gross loss ratio over the last four quarters was steady at 73%, meaning 73% of its revenue went to paying claims. Lemonade also shared in the Investor Day conference that it expects to be adjusted EBITDA profitable by 2026 and GAAP net income profitable by 2027. Lemonade still has some challenges to overcome, and there's always the risk of a disaster like the California wildfires, which weighed on Q1 results, but management's efforts to streamline its business seem to finally be paying off. At a market cap of $3 billion, the stock could easily double from here, especially if Lemonade executes on its plan to turn profitable.",

        "header": "Which AI Stocks May Soar After Reaching Record Highs?",
        "content": "After declines earlier in the year, many artificial intelligence (AI) stocks have rebounded and even skyrocketed amid optimism that U.S. trade decisions won't weigh heavily on growth. Which of these players might continue to soar after reaching record highs recently? Nvidia(NVDA-0.63%),Oracle(ORCL4.14%), andBroadcom(AVGO2.40%)still have plenty of room to run. Here's why. Image source: Getty Images. Nvidia has played the principal role in the initial stages of the AI boom, the period of infrastructure build-out, thanks to the company's powerful AI chips. Known asgraphics processing units(GPUs), they power one of the key early steps crucial to AI: the training of models. This has helped Nvidia report double- and triple-digit revenue growth over the past several quarters, with revenue reaching record levels. The reason why Nvidia could remain on this path is that the company hasn't only built a solid position in the GPU market -- it's also created a full portfolio of related products and services so that a customer aiming to build and deploy AI could rely on Nvidia every step of the way. The company even has looked ahead to future growth drivers, such as theconvergence of AI and quantum computing. Nvidia recently announced its development of a quantum research center to match quantum hardware with AI supercomputers. All this suggests Nvidia's fast-paced growth isn't set to stop. And with the speed of innovation and news in the AI and quantum fields, catalysts for stock performance may pop up pretty frequently. Finally, Nvidia's valuation -- with the stock trading for 36xforward earnings estimates-- is reasonable, offering room for additional gains. Oracle was once most associated with database management, and its software still dominates in that area. But the company has expanded significantly over its nearly 50-year history, and today has found itself among leaders in the cloud infrastructure space. Customers love Oracle because it offers them great flexibility, with the ability to simultaneously use Oracle along with other clouds -- thanks to the Oracle multicloud service -- and access to other options as well. On top of this, Oracle offers customers cloud applications, which is proving to be another growth area. In fact, speaking of growth, the company reported double-digit increases in revenue across its businesses in the latest quarter. For example, cloud infrastructure revenue advanced 52% to $3 billion, while cloud application revenue added 12% to $3.7 billion. What makes me most optimistic regarding revenue growth to come, though, are two elements. First, remaining performance obligations (RPO), or revenue yet to be booked from signed contracts, has surged in recent quarters. In the most recent, it rose 41% to $138 billion. Second, demand for Oracle's cloud capacity also has been soaring -- the company said a customer in the recent quarter asked to take all available capacity, regardless of its location. These are positive signs for growth ahead, suggesting Oracle stock could keep on marching higher in the second half of this year. Broadcom is a networking specialist, making thousands of products, used everywhere from your smartphone to data centers. But the company has truly seen business take off amid the demand for AI. In the latest quarter, for instance, AI semiconductor solutions and infrastructure software powered revenue and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) higher. First-quarter AI revenue jumped 77% to $4.1 billion, while infrastructure software revenue climbed 47% to $6.7 billion. And the company predicted that the momentum will be ongoing as major cloud companies ramp up data centers, requiring chips and connectivity. Broadcom said it expects the current growth rate to continue into the next fiscal year, consideringtraining and inferencingdemand. And speaking of demand, Broadcom says it's been \"tremendous\" for its newest launch, the Tomahawk 6, the latest version of its Ethernet switching product, as customers aim for speed across AI workloads. In fact, Broadcom says its complete networking portfolio, including switches, routers, and network interface cards (NICs), are \"driving our success\" with these large-scale AI customers. All this suggests that Broadcom's earnings momentum will remain strong, and that could be the key to more stock price gains in the months to come.",

        "content": "When it comes to artificial intelligence (AI) chips, most investors typically think about the graphics processing units (GPUs) designed byNvidia(NVDA-0.63%)andAdvanced Micro Devices(AMD-1.56%). GPU sales have soared for both companies over the last couple of years, and in Nvidia's case, they have added trillions of dollars to its market capitalization. ButMicron Technology(MU-0.42%)also deserves recognition for its memory and storage chips, which are increasingly important for AI workloads in data centers, personal computers, and even smartphones. The company just released financial results for its fiscal 2025 third quarter (which ended May 29), revealing a continued surge in demand for AI-related memory capacity. Micron stock is up 42% in 2025 already, but here's why it might still be a screaming buy. Image source: Getty Images. Data centerGPUsare designed for parallel processing, which means they can perform several computations simultaneously and handle the enormous data sets required to deployAI models. But these workloads also need high-bandwidth memory (HBM), which stores information in a ready state so it can be called upon by the GPU at a moment's notice. Micron's HBM3E solution for the data center leads the industry in performance and efficiency. In fact, Nvidia selected it to power its latest Blackwell and Blackwell Ultra GPUs, andAdvanced Micro Devices(AMD) will also use it in its upcoming MI355X GPUs. Micron is now gearing up to produce commercial quantities of its new HBM4 data center solution next year, which will deliver a 60% performance boost over HBM3E and consume 20% less power, making it ideal fornext-generation \"reasoning\" AI models. Micron estimates its addressable market for data center HBM will be worth $35 billion this calendar year, and expects that figure to soar to $100 billion by 2030, so there is an enormous opportunity ahead for the company. But some AI workloads are now being processed on personal computers (PCs) and smartphones without the need for external computing capacity from data centers. This trend will accelerate as chips become more powerful, and it's already driving up demand for DRAM (memory). Micron says AI-enabled PCs typically require a minimum DRAM capacity of 16 gigabytes, compared to 12 gigabytes for their non-AI counterparts, and AI smartphones are commanding a similar increase in capacity. Micron generated $9.3 billion in totalrevenueduring the fiscal 2025 third quarter, ended May 29. It was a 37% increase from the year-ago period, and it was also comfortably above the high end of management's guidance range, which was $9 billion. But the real growth story lies beneath the surface of the headline number. Micron's compute and networking segment, which is where it accounts for its data center HBM sales, delivered $5.1 billion in revenue, which was a whopping 97% increase from the year-ago period. Revenue from the mobile segment came in at $1.6 billion, and while that was down 2% year over year, it represented growth of 45% sequentially (compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2025 three months earlier). Micron's soaring revenue also led to a strong result at the bottom line during the quarter. Its generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)earnings per share(EPS) soared by an eye-popping 460% year over year to $1.68. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter (which will end Aug. 31), Micron is forecasting a record $10.7 billion in revenue along with $2.29 in EPS, which would represent year-over-year increases of 38% and 190%, respectively. Despite its 42% gain in 2025 so far, Micron stock is still relatively cheap. Based on the company's trailing-12-month EPS of $5.55, the stock is trading at aprice-to-earnings (P/E) ratioof 22.5. That's a 55% discount toNvidia stock, which currently trades at a P/E ratio of 50.9:  NVDA PE Ratiodata byYCharts Considering Micron's HBM3E solution is integrated into all of Nvidia's latest GPUs, Micron's data center sales should grow in lockstep with Nvidia's data center sales from here. When you also factor in the potential demand from AMD for its latest GPUs, and demand for memory from AI PC and smartphone manufacturers, it's reasonable to conclude that Micron stock deserves a higher valuation. As a result, Micron stock could be a great buy right now, especially for investors who already own Nvidia and AMD and are looking to diversify their AI semiconductor holdings.",

        "content": "Elon Musk andTesla(TSLA-6.63%)rolled out their long-awaited Robotaxi autonomous ride-hailing service recently in Austin, Texas. The company has launched with a small fleet that operates within a limited area, with the hope of expanding rapidly, marking a significant milestone as Tesla seeks to gain ground onAlphabet's Waymo. Tesla stock is up approximately 42% from lows hit in early April. Shares had momentum throughout much of June, but have started to fade since Robotaxi officially hit the streets (down around 9%). Can Tesla stock hold on to its recent gains, or are shares (down roughly 21% year to date) likely to continue lower? Here is what you need to know. Image source: Getty Images. Tesla's Robotaxi launch came with a lot of hype. Elon Musk mentioned a couple of years ago that Tesla's value hinged on autonomous driving, and some of Wall Street's biggest names have peggedsky-high price targetson the stock because of Rototaxi. So, Robotaxi's recent launch is a big deal. However, there is some fine print associated with Tesla's early autonomous ride-hailing offerings. For instance, Robotaxis technically drive themselves, but come with a human Tesla employee in the passenger seat to intervene as needed. Robotaxis are also limited to a defined map, avoid complex intersections, and won't operate in inclement weather. In the first week since its launch, and despite the restricted use parameters, incidents have already been reported on social media of Robotaxis making mistakes, such as driving in the wrong lane or slamming on their brakes for no apparent reason. It seems Robotaxi isn't as refined as investors hoped, which could help explain why Tesla stock has cooled this past week. The immediate problem for Tesla and investors is that if Robotaxi underwhelms, the narrative shifts back to Tesla's actual electric vehicle (EV) business. After all, selling vehicles is still the company's core function. Tesla's sales have dramatically slumped. Some of the drop is likely tied to the fallout from Elon Musk'sefforts in government, which began before last year's election. Politics can be a no-win situation because, regardless of which side you fall on, you're bound to alienate the side that disagrees with you. The company delivered 336,681 vehicles in Q1 2025, representing a nearly 13% decline from the previous year. Tesla's sales slump may not be entirely due to political blowback; consumers have struggled amid higher interest rates, inflation, and worries about the economy going forward. The vandalism of vehicles and sales centers and the protests that dominated news headlines earlier this year offer some further proof that politics played some role in the slowdown. It also doesn't help that Tesla's Cybertruck has not been well-received by car enthusiasts. The good news is that things can improve in the coming months. Elon Musk has mostly pulled back from the political scene (at least for the moment), and Robotaxi could still improve its technology as the pilot program progresses. On the other hand, it's unclear whether the damage to Tesla's brand is permanent, or if not, how long the stench will linger. Additionally, Robotaxi may struggle to expand, at least in the near term, if Tesla's self-driving technology is further behind schedule than hoped.  Data byYCharts. Tesla's declining sales have weighed on the business, as earnings are also declining, which in turn is ratcheting up the stock's valuation. Tesla'sprice-to-earnings ratio, currently an excessive 177, could begin dragging the share price down further if the market loses confidence that earnings will rebound anytime soon. Investors may not have much to hang their hat on until sales rebound or Robotaxi improves. Therefore, Tesla seems more likely to resume its post-election downtrend than to recapture the gains it enjoyed leading up to the Robotaxi launch. It could be wise to stay on the sidelines for now and revisit Tesla once there are more signs of progress.",

        "header": "This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Powerhouse Could Be Just Getting Started",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence(AI) has long drawn the interest of investors. AI has been used in various forms going back to the turn of the century for companies like Google parentAlphabet, and others. Thegenerative AIboom is a much more recent breakthrough, and it is driving considerable investment returns for companies likeNvidiaandPalantir Technologies. The AI-based breakthroughs continue, and that is inspiring gains in other AI-driven tech stocks. Such gains may have just begun for one particular tech stock. Image source: Getty Images. The stock that is well-positioned to start benefiting from the latest AI changes isQualcomm(QCOM0.54%). Admittedly, Qualcomm does not look much like a winner in AI. It released the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 in the fall of 2023, empowering users to incorporate AI into their smartphones. Although revenue growth in handset sales eventually returned to double-digit levels, AI has failed to inspire the level of increased sales that Qualcomm experienced when users wanted to upgrade to 5G. Moreover, after years of failed attempts,Appleappears finally ready to replace Qualcomm's chips in the iPhone with chips of its own design. Assuming Apple does not reverse course, Qualcomm is set to lose one of its largest customers. However, it may hearten investors to know that Qualcomm has long prepared for the day when it will depend less on smartphones. Its Internet-of-Things (IoT) segment has applied its communications abilities to develop end-to-end IoT solutions for applications such as smart homes and industrial automation. Additionally, its communications and AI advances could make it a leader in self-driving through its automotive segment. In the first six months of fiscal 2025 (ended March 30), revenue for the IoT and automotive segments increased at annual rates of 31% and 60%, respectively, significantly outpacing the 12% growth in the handset segment over the same period. Furthermore, Qualcomm has developed PC chips, making it a competitor toAMDandIntel. In the data center market, it has also partnered with Nvidia to develop custom chips that can support AI workloads within data centers. These recent advancements appear to be helping Qualcomm's top and bottom lines more than its stock. In the first two quarters of fiscal 2025, revenue of nearly $23 billion increased by 17% compared with the same period in fiscal 2024. During the same period last year, revenue had risen by only 3% annually. In the first six months of the year, Qualcomm kept a lid on operating expense growth. Still, with lower investment income and rising income tax expenses, its $6 billion innet incomegrew by 18% yearly. Nonetheless, such improvements have not swayed investors. Over the last 12 months, Qualcomm stock dropped by almost 20%, though it is up 27% from the lows it reached in April. Additionally, the stock sells at a 16P/E ratio. Although that is not much lower than the average P/E ratio of 20 over the last five years, the earnings multiple suggests a lack of investor optimism about Qualcomm stock. And yet, this reasonable valuation could inspire a bull market in Qualcomm stock. Assuming its non-handset segments continue to grow at a rapid rate, it could start Qualcomm stock on a long-term growth trend. Considering the state of Qualcomm's business and stock, it has real potential to begin a long-term growth trend. Admittedly, a lackluster AI growth cycle and the likelihood of losing Apple as a customer have soured some investors on Qualcomm. However, the company has returned to revenue and earnings growth, and its burgeoning IoT and automotive segments deserve significant credit for this surge. Ultimately, such improvements should not lead to a falling stock price and a rock-bottom valuation. Once Qualcomm's role in AI becomes clearer, such conditions could inspire the beginning of a long-term uptrend in Qualcomm stock.",

        "header": "These Are the Stocks You Should Watch in July",
        "content": "Stockssoared to record highsin June, boosted by optimism about possible trade deals, easing geopolitical tensions, and hope that the Federal Reserve could resume cutting interest rates in the coming months. In July, market participants will first be watching President Trump's \"One Big Beautiful Bill,\" which legislators aim to pass this week. Investors' attention will then turn to second-quarter corporate results, which start rolling in mid-month. Wall Street will be looking for signs of the impact that tariffs are having on profit margins and consumer demand. Below, we look at stocks that are worth watching this month. Microsoft (MSFT) is expected to report quarterly earnings late in the month, and the results, if they\u2019re anything like last quarter\u2019s, could make the software giant the world\u2019s first $4 trillion company. Microsoft in April reported cloud computing revenueincreased by 21%in the first three months of the year, helping to drive better-than-expected results on the top and bottom lines. Shares jumped nearly 8% the next day, and the stock has climbed steadily to a series of record highs ever since. The results helped torevive an AI tradethat, because of tariff-driven anxiety, was struggling to regain its footing after theDeepSeek shock in January. The AI rally of the last two months has lifted tech stocks to record highs and set earnings expectations high for giants like Microsoft. Microsoft shares rose 8% in June, putting the stock up 18% since the start of the year. Tesla (TSLA) is slated to report second-quarter deliveries on July 2, and investors will be watching to see if the numbers have stabilized now that CEO Elon Musk has put some distance between himself and his controversial work with President Trump. Tesla salesslumpedacross the globe earlier this year amid a consumer backlash to Musk\u2019s work with the White House\u2019s cost-cutting task force, the Department of Government Efficiency, and his support for far-right parties in Europe. Deliveriescontinued to declinein several key European markets in May, suggesting the carmaker\u2019s reputational troubles could linger. Granted, car deliveries may matter less to Wall Street than they did as recently as last year. That\u2019s because Musk has\u2014at least rhetorically\u2014pinned Tesla\u2019s future on its nascent self-driving software and the robotaxi service he envisages it powering. Teslasoft-launched its robotaxi servicein Austin, Texas, late last month. The rollout wasn\u2019t without its hiccups\u2014federal regulators reportedly contacted the company after videos circulated online showing its cars driving erratically.Still, Musk called the launch a success, and intends to ramp the service within Austin and expand to other metro areas before the end of the year.\u00a0(Though Musk'songoing feud with Trumpover his deficit-growing \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" could lead federal regulators to throw up obstacles to Tesla's robotaxi expansion.) Analysts are likely to query Musk about the timeline of a wider robotaxi launch during the company\u2019s second-quarter earnings call, likely to take place closer to the end of the month. Tesla shares fell 8.3% last month, pushing their year-to-date decline to 21%. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is expected to report quarterly results late in the month, and expectations could be elevated after the stock\u2019s big run-up in June. AMD shares rose 28% last month, their best since May 2023. AMD hosted its Advancing AI event where the chipmakerunveiled a new graphics processing unitto compete with Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) Blackwell chips, and said it would launch a \u2018Helios\u2019 rack-scale system to take on Nvidia\u2019s Vera Rubin series starting in 2026. Analysts were impressed by the event. Piper Sandler raised its price target on the stock, saying \u2018Helios\u2019 would be \u201cpivotal\u201d for AMD\u2019s growth.Bank of America noted that Nvidia remained the AI chip leader, but that AMD had proven it was cementing its spot as \u201cthe next-best AI vendor.\u201d The stock could take a hit this month from the announcement of semiconductor tariffs, which President Trump ordered the Commerce Department to investigate in April. Section 232 tariff investigations usually take 270 days, but Trump has reportedly requested a speedier review, and his penchant for 90-day timelines\u2014seetariff pauses\u2014could mean the end of that investigation lands in July. After AMD\u2019s June rally, shares are up more than 17% since the start of the year. The \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill\u201d making its way through Congress contains provisions that are likely to deal a major blow to solar and other renewable energy companies. TheSenate versionthat was being considered on Monday would phase out tax credits for wind and solar projects by 2027, a less severe provision than the House bill passed in May, which repeals the credits for any project that hasn\u2019t broken ground within 60 days of the law\u2019s enactment. The two bills will need to be reconciled before being sent to President Trump\u2019s desk, which he\u2019s said he wants done this week. The Senate bill contained the slightest of silver linings for companies like First Solar (FSLR) that manufacture their products in the U.S. It levies new taxes on imported renewables equipment, and an additional penalty for projects that use equipment from China, one of the world\u2019s largest manufacturers of clean energy technology. The renewable provisions in the final bill are likely to be in flux right up to the July 4th deadline, but wind and solar investors will be hoping for some mercy from lawmakers. Ford (F) is expected to report quarterly results late in the month, and investors will be looking to its guidance to judge how big a toll tariffs are likely to take on corporate earnings this year. The carmakersuspended its full-year guidance, citing the unpredictable tariff outlook, when it reported first-quarter earnings in May. The company estimated it would take a $2.5 billion hit from the tariffs, but that it could offset about $1 billion of those costs. The tariff picture has become slightly clearer in recent months. Imported vehicles and autoparts are subject to a 25% tariff, except for those that comply with the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement negotiated during the first Trump presidency. Those levies went into effect in the second quarter, and the true cost of those tariffs should be evident in both Ford\u2019s results and financial projections. Ford shares rose 4.5% in June, putting the stock up nearly 10% since the start of the year.",

        "content": "With the year half over, it's clear that one theme has dominated the market: artificial intelligence. AI remains the prevailing theme because AI hyperscalers continue to invest substantial amounts of money in it. These piles of money are mostly being invested in data centers, which can take years to be built and become operational. As a result, there are still years of growth in the AI pipeline, which makes investing in these companies today a great idea. If you've got $5,000 (or really any amount), investing that sum of money into this group seems like a wise idea. Image source: Getty Images. Nvidia(NVDA-1.04%)is a key supplier in the AI arms race, as itsgraphics processing units (GPUs)have become the predominant computing unit used for AI computing. It's still experiencing impressive growth, with revenue rising 69% year over year during Q1 FY2026 (ending April 28) and projecting 50% revenue growth to $45 billion in Q2. This growth is expected to persist for years to come, as the various data centers being built will need to be outfitted with Nvidia GPUs. Furthermore, many of the GPUs deployed over the past few years are starting to wear out, which will require the purchase of even more GPUs. Nvidia's growth is far from over, and it will continue to be a top AI stock pick, considering that its GPUs are the industry standard for running AI workloads. Nvidia can't fabricate its own chips, so it outsources that work toTaiwan Semiconductor(TSM0.45%), the world's leading chip foundry. TSMC serves as the go-to chip manufacturer for nearly every major tech company, having solidified its position with cutting-edge technology, consistent delivery, and industry-leading yields. Management projects massive growth over the next five years thanks to AI chips. They project a 45% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) for the next five years, which contributes to the company's overall revenue CAGR of nearly 20% over that same time span. That growth is an excellent reason to own Taiwan Semiconductor,and I think it's one of the best buys right now. Amazon(AMZN-0.10%)may not be the first company you think of when hearing about AI, but itscloud computingwing is powering many AI workloads right now. Its Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the industry leader in cloud computing, offering clients access to the best computing hardware available. This allows start-ups or companies that don't require a massive data center filled with GPUs to access these cutting-edge devices for training or running their AI models. AWS is the main part of Amazon's investment thesis for me, as it accounted for 63% of Amazon's operating profits during Q1, despite making up only 19% of revenue. This makes Amazon a cloud computing stock, not a commerce stock, in my eyes. With cloud computing growth expected to persist for many years, it's a great investment to make now. Alphabet(GOOG-0.58%)(NASDAQ: GOOGL)also has a strong cloud computing unit in Google Cloud, and is delivering solid growth from its legacy businesses. However, it is getting no respect from the markets and currently trades at a dirt cheap price tag of 17.8times forward earnings.  GOOGL PE Ratio (Forward)data byYCharts Considering that the broader market, as measured by theS&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC), trades at 22.8 times forward earnings, Alphabet's stock is trading at a significant discount. With Alphabet delivering market-beating growth and trading at a relatively low price tag, I think it's an excellent stock to consider now, and it helps balance out some of the more expensively valued stocks on this list. Meta Platforms(META-0.83%)is likely better known by its former name, Facebook. It's the parent company of social media sites like Facebook, Threads, Instagram, and WhatsApp, and gets nearly all of its revenue from ads on its platforms. Meta is working on integrating its AI technology to enhance the advertising experience for both advertisers and users of its platform. This could result in increased revenue for the company, allowing it to continue its impressive 16% revenue growth and 27% operating profit growth that it posted in Q1. Those are stellar growth figures, and if Meta can deliver results like that again in Q2, it will maintain its statusas one of the top stocks to buy right now.",

        "content": "At this point, it seems highly likely that artificial intelligence (AI) is on track to be the most impactful new technology since the internet. While the progression of the tech trend will certainly bring some twists and turns for investors, there's a good chance that the AI revolution is still in relatively early innings. Companies with heavy exposure to AI have been some of the market's best performers in recent years and helped push major indexes to new highs, and long-term investors still have opportunities to score wins with top players in the space. With that in mind, read on to see why two Motley Fool contributors think that two companies, in particular, with leading positions in AI will stand as the world's most valuable businesses five years from now. Image source: Getty Images. Jennifer Saibil(Nvidia):Nvidia(NVDA-0.63%)has rocketed to the point where it is now the world's most valuable company, passingMicrosoftandApplealong the way. There's good reason to expect it will still be at the top of the podium five years from now. A big reason for expectation is that Nvidia is growing much faster than Microsoft and Apple, as well as the rest of the world's most valuable companies. Revenue increased 69% year over year in its fiscal 2026 first quarter (ended April 27), and management is guiding for a 50% increase in the second quarter. It has incredibly high gross margins, which came in at 71.3% in the first quarter without a one-time charge, and the net profit margin was 52% in the quarter. Nvidia has a massive opportunity over the next few years as AI gets incorporated more into what people do. It partners with most of the major AI companies, likeAmazon(AMZN0.30%)and Microsoft, and as they roll out their AI platforms, there's an even greater demand for Nvidia's products. The demand fordata centers alone, which AI companies use to help power generative AI operations, is exploding. Nvidia's data center revenue set the pace for the company overall, increasing 73% year over year in the first quarter. According to Statista, the AI market is expected to increase at a compound annual growth rate of 26% over the next five years, surpassing $1 trillion by 2031. As the leader in the chip industry, with the most powerful products and as much as 95% of the market share, it will be one of the main beneficiaries of that growth. Nvidia keeps launching new and more powerful chips to handle the increasing demand and power load. It's still bringing out the Blackwell technology that it launched last year, and it's seeing a huge need for its products to drive the inference part of generative AI. Nvidia management says its GPUs are being incorporated into 100 of what it calls AI factories (AI-focused data centers) under development in the first quarter, double last year's number, and the number of graphics processing units powering each factory doubled as well. Management expects this segment of the business to continue growing at a rapid pace. It's now launching Blackwell Ultra, a more powerful tool for AI reasoning, which is the next step after inference and requires greater capacity. CEO Jensen Huang envisions a future not too far off where AI is used in everything we do, and Nvidia is going to play a huge role in that shift. Keith Noonan(Amazon):As the leading provider of cloud infrastructure services, Amazon stands to be a major beneficiary of the AI revolution. The development, launch, and scaling of artificial intelligence applications stands to be a powerful tailwind for the company's Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud business, and theBedrocksuite and other generative AI tools should help to encourage clients to continue building within its ecosystem. With AWS standing as Amazon's most profitable segment by far, AI-related sales for the segment should help to drive strong earnings growth over the next five years. Artificial intelligence being integrated into the company's fast-growing digital advertising business should also help to improve targeting and demand and create another positive catalyst for the company's bottom line. But there's an even bigger AI-related opportunity on the table -- and it could make Amazon the world's most valuable company within the next half-decade. Even though AWS generates most of Amazon's profits, the company's e-commerce business still accounts for the majority of its revenue. The catch is that e-commerce has historically been a relatively low-margin business. Due to the emphasis that Amazon has placed on expanding its retail sales base and the high operating costs involved with running the business, e-commerce accounts for a surprisingly small share of the company's profits despite the massive scale of the unit. That will likely change with time. With AI and robotics paving the way for warehouse and factory automation and potentially opening the door for a variety of autonomous delivery options, operating expenses for the e-commerce business are poised to fall substantially. There's admittedly a significant amount of guesswork involved in charting how quickly this transformation will take shape, but it's a trend that's worth betting on. Given the incredible sales base that Amazon has built for its online retail wing, margin improvements look poised to unlock billions of dollars in fresh net income for the business. If AI-driven robotics and automation initiatives start to accelerate substantially for the company over the next five years, the e-commerce side of the business will quickly command a much higher valuation premium. If so, Amazon has a clear path to being one of the world's most valuable companies.",

        "content": "Although the technology arena is still heavily involved in the artificial intelligence (AI) arms race, the quantum computing race is starting to heat up. Quantum computing could unlock the next phase of AI, as well as drive innovations in other fields, like logistics. However, the industry is still a few years away from seeing quantum computing deployed on a wide scale, and investors need to be careful not to get involved too early. Still, I think there are a few quantum computing stocks that are worth buying today and could work out well for investors, regardless of how the next few years of quantum computing developments unfold. Image source: Getty Images. Nvidia(NVDA-0.63%)probably isn't the first company that comes to mind when you think of quantum computing. It specializes ingraphics processing units (GPUs), which are built to run using traditional computing techniques. However, Nvidia sees the potential in quantum computing and wants to partner with as many quantum computing companies as possible to ensure its equipment is used in conjunction withquantum computers. One technology that sets Nvidia apart in the GPU world is its CUDA software, which allows developers to maximize the computing potential of GPUs. Nvidia has begun developing CUDA-Q software, which will integrate with various quantum processing units being developed by other companies. This software integration will bridge the gap between traditional and quantum computing, ensuring that Nvidia, regardless of its success, will capture a slice of the quantum market. In the meantime, investors continue to reap the benefits of Nvidia's GPU sales, which are fueling the AI arms race. There's still a ton more computing capacity that needs to be built out, and Nvidia's stock will continue to capitalize on that for years to come. Alphabet(GOOG-0.58%)(GOOGL-0.25%)kicked off the quantum computing investment hype in December when it announced its Willow quantum computing chip. Willow solved a problem in five minutes that would have taken the fastest supercomputer 10 septillion (10 to the 25th power) years to complete. This test was stacked in Willow's favor, as it involved a problem that leverages quantum computing's strengths, but it demonstrates that accurate quantum computing technology is feasible. Similar to Nvidia, Alphabet doesn't need its quantum computing investments to work out in order to be a successful investment. It has an incredibly successful base business and is also developing top-notch AI tools that will allow Alphabet to excel in an AI-first world. Furthermore, Alphabet's stock is currently undervalued at18 times forward earnings.  GOOGL PE Ratio (Forward)data byYCharts While most quantum computing and AI stocks are quite expensive, Alphabet's stock offers solid value to investors. Alphabet is a heavyweight competitor in both the AI and quantum computing races, making it an excellent buy right now. IonQ(IONQ-4.72%)is a pure-play quantum computing investment, and it's my top pick among companies whose business models are solely based on the success of its quantum computing products. There is no backup plan for IonQ; if it fails, the stock price will drop to $0. This is an important consideration for investors, and position sizing needs to be appropriate for a company that carries as much risk as IonQ. However, there are several positive signs with IonQ's stock. It holds several key quantum computing contracts, including one with the U.S. Air Force Research Lab. The company also boasts a leading two-qubit gate fidelity, a common measure of the accuracy of a quantum computing calculation. This stems from IonQ's all-to-all connectivity, which allows each qubit to interact with each other to produce the most accurate calculation possible. Furthermore, IonQ has developed a practical approach for quantum computing, as its trapped ion approach enables the computers to operate at room temperature. Most other solutions are focusing on the superconducting path, which requires cooling the particle to nearly absolute zero temperatures. Should IonQ's technology deliver solid results for prospective clients, it can differentiate itself from the competition based solely on its operating costs. IonQ is still a long shot, but I think it's the best among the pure-play start-ups. Pairing IonQ with Alphabet and Nvidia in an investment portfolio is a solid approach, as it allows investors to balance the risk of an all-or-nothing investment like IonQ with companiesthat have established, solid businesses, such as Nvidiaand Alphabet.",

        "content": "One of the biggest misconceptions about investing is the idea that you need to have lots of money to get started. Now that discount brokerages have done away with stock trading fees, investors who build their portfolios with pocket change can perform just as well as folks who have millions to work with. Right now, two outstanding stocks highlight just how easy it is to get started with investing in small increments. At recent prices, $200 is enough to buy a full share of bothNvidia(NVDA-1.04%)andSportradar Group(SRAD-0.28%). Both of these well-positioned businesses have strong advantages that could allow them to outperform the competition in the decade ahead. Image source: Getty Images. Even the fear of new tariffs can't stop the largest cloud service providers from buying Nvidia's graphics processing units hand over fist. The designer of the chips that most artificial intelligence (AI) applications rely upon reported fiscal first-quarter sales that surged 12% from the previous quarter and 69% from the previous-year period. Investors excited about the rapid growth of Nvidia's GPU sales pushed shares of the stock up 67% from a low point it reached in April. Expected spending on data centers could push it even higher. Late last year, four of the world's largest tech companies forecast upcoming data center investments worth a combined$300 billionin 2025. Looking further ahead, CEO Jensen Huang is predicting annual data center spending will top$1 trillionby 2028. Big tech's data center ambitions suggest significant growth ahead. Nvidia's fiscal first quarter ended on April 27 with just $156 billion in annualized data center revenue. A strongnetwork effectmeans investors can reasonably assume Nvidia will absorb heaps of AI data center spending in the years ahead. Nearly all developers of AI applications are already familiar with CUDA, the software development kit (SDK) specific to Nvidia's products. Even if Nvidia's competitors build superior chips at a discount, developers already know that selling them without an SDK is an uphill battle. Despite a strong competitive advantage and clear data center building intentions from the world's biggest tech businesses, Nvidia stock has been trading at 36.8times forward earningsestimates. This is a high valuation if you assume Huang's prediction regarding the next few years of data center spending is too ambitious. For investors with a high risk tolerance who think AI is here to stay, this is a great stock to buy now and hold over the long run. In 2018, the Supreme Court paved the way for legalized sports betting. Now, 38 states offer it, and more are on the way. It's easy for gamblers to switch applications when placing a bet. Whether they use a service fromFlutterorDraftKings, Sportradar Group orGenius Sportsis more than likely providing the data. In the U.S., Sportradar Group has partnerships with the NBA, NHL, NASCAR, and MLB. Headquartered in Europe, Sportradar also has partnerships with larger international organizations like FIFA. Except for Genius Sports, there aren't any competitors with nearly as large a footprint in the sports data niche. Recently, Sportradar secured exclusive rights to distribute low-latency betting data from the ongoing FIFA Club World Cup. With heaps of cameras already set up in stadiums around the world, Sportradar was an obvious choice for FIFA. Sportradar reported first-quarter sales that rose 17% year over year and expects further growth at this pace. In the western hemisphere, the overall sports betting market is expected to climb by 17% annually through 2029. Without just one viable competitor in sight, management expects total revenue to grow by at least 15% annually over the next three years. Sportradar stock has been trading at 53 times its trailingfree cash flow. This looks like an extremely steep valuation, but not once you factor in management's expectation to grow free cash flow by at least 33% annually over the next three years. A high valuation means the bottom could fall out from under this stock if management can't meet its forecasts. Given the high barriers to entry in this rapidly growing niche industry, I won't be surprised if the company blows past its forecasts. Adding some shares to a diversified portfolio now and holding on for at least a decade looks like a smart move.",

        "header": "Netflix\u2019s Lofty Valuation Has Even Bullish Investors Nervous",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) \u2014 Netflix Inc (NFLX). investors face a dilemma: Continue to bet on a stock that has delivered best-in-class returns over the past year or reconsider shares that increasingly look like they\u2019re priced for perfection. Most Read from Bloomberg Struggling Downtowns Are Looking to Lure New Crowds Philadelphia Transit System Votes to Cut Service by 45%, Hike Fares Squeezed by Crowds, the Roads of Central Park Are Being Reimagined Sprawl Is Still Not the Answer The streaming giant\u2019s stock price has nearly doubled over the last 12 months amid growth from advertising sales, subscription price increases and limited exposure to tariffs. While that makes it one of the best performing S&P 500 members over that span, it\u2019s also boosted its valuation to 46 times expected earnings for the next year. In comparison, Nvidia Corp. is priced at 32 times while the Nasdaq 100 is at 27 times. Such a premium valuation, Netflix\u2019s highest since 2021 \u2014 when its growth was being supercharged by the pandemic \u2014 is making even bullish investors wary of a potential sell off. Second-quarter earnings are due on July 17. \u201cI feel really good about its fundamentals, in terms of its pricing power, ad business and move into live events, but expectations have gotten to the point that any disappointment would be a risk,\u201d said Michael Smith, senior portfolio manager and head of growth equity at Allspring Global Investments. After tumbling in 2022 amid slumping subscriber growth, Netflix shares have roared back as the company cracked down on password sharing and turned to advertising to boost revenue. Meanwhile, live events like WWE Raw are helping attract new subscribers. Netflix is the fourth best-performing stock in the Nasdaq 100 this year and now boasts a market value of $570 billion, bigger than Mastercard Inc. and Exxon Mobil Corp. Netflix\u2019s revenue is expected to rise 14% in 2025, down from 16% growth in 2024, according to the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. While that\u2019s a vast improvement from 2022, when revenue rose by about 6.5%, it pales in comparison to 2020 and 2021, when Netflix\u2019s sales jumped 24% and 19%, respectively, as pandemic era lockdowns sent subscriber growth soaring. Still, most analysts on Wall Street remain bullish on the stock with a slate of programming this year that includes NFL games, boxing and new seasons of the popular shows Squid Game and Stranger Things. Last month, Oppenheimer & Co. described Netflix\u2019s outlook as \u201cironclad\u201d and raised the price target on the stock, one of many to do so in June. However, the shares have risen faster than analysts have upped their projections, leaving Netflix trading roughly 10% above the average price target of $1,217, suggesting limited upside potential over the coming months. Plenty of investors are undeterred by Netflix\u2019s valuation. Ken Mahoney, chief executive officer of Mahoney Asset Management, acknowledges it\u2019s a steep price to pay but believes Netflix\u2019s market dominance justifies the premium. \u201cPeople often miss great companies because they worry about valuation, and I don\u2019t have a problem spending up for what Netflix offers,\u201d Mahoney said. Netflix is \u201cdoing all the right things and is like a snowball getting bigger as it rolls downhill.\u201d Another factor that\u2019s helped power Netflix\u2019s rally is that the stock has become much more widely owned. According to Bank of America data published at the end of May, Netflix was owned by 49% of long-only funds, making it the ninth-most-widely-held technology stock. About 14% of such funds held the stock in early 2016. Despite all of the tailwinds in Netflix\u2019s favor, Allspring Global\u2019s Smith questions what will be the next driver of Netflix\u2019s rally given the high valuation. \u201cThere is a lot of fundamental momentum at Netflix, but the valuation backdrop has changed, and it is hard to say that this kind of multiple expansion is repeatable,\u201d Smith said. Tech Chart of the Day Chinese automakers continued to expand their European foothold in May, capturing the highest share ever of hybrid-car sales and the biggest slice of the electric-vehicle market in 10 months. Manufacturers led by BYD Co. and SAIC Motor Corp.\u2019s MG surpassed 9% share in both of those categories, based on figures from industry researcher Dataforce. Including combustion-engine models, European registrations of Chinese-branded cars topped 5% for the first time. Top Tech News Apple Inc. is considering using artificial intelligence technology from Anthropic PBC or OpenAI to power a new version of Siri, sidelining its own in-house models in a potentially blockbuster move aimed at turning around its flailing AI effort. Meta Platforms Inc. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg announced a major restructuring of the company\u2019s artificial intelligence group, including a commitment to developing AI \u201csuperintelligence,\u201d or systems that can complete tasks as well as or even better than humans. The prospective buyer of TikTok\u2019s American operations cited by President Donald Trump is the same investor consortium including Oracle Corp., Blackstone Inc. and venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, whose bid for the app had stalled amid US-China trade tensions, according to a person familiar with the matter. Nintendo Co. pulled its products from Amazon.com Inc.\u2019s US site after a disagreement over unauthorized sales, meaning the e-commerce company missed out on the recent debut of Nintendo\u2019s Switch 2 \u2014 the biggest game console launch of all time. Microsoft Corp.\u2019s top sales executive is planning to take a two-month sabbatical, a move that coincides with an expected wave of terminations targeting his organization. Wolfspeed Inc., a chipmaker caught in President Donald Trump\u2019s push to reshape Biden-era tech subsidies, filed bankruptcy to enact a creditor-backed plan to slash $4.6 billion in debt.

In a post on his Truth Social platform early Tuesday, Trump accused Musk of gaining from subsidies on electric cars. \"Elon may get more subsidy than any human being in history, by far, and without subsidies, Elon would probably have to close up shop and head back home to South Africa,\" Trump wrote. Trump's signature \"One Big Beautiful Bill,\" currently being debated by the Senate, includes a provision to eliminate the $7,500 new EV tax credit, a key piece of former President Joe Biden's efforts to accelerate U.S. EV adoption. \"No more Rocket launches, Satellites, or Electric Car Production, and our Country would save a FORTUNE. Perhaps we should have DOGE take a good, hard, look at this? BIG MONEY TO BE SAVED!!!,\u201d Trump added as he lashed out at his former ally. Musk, who also is the CEO of rocket company SpaceX, recently stepped down from running the cost-cutting Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in order to focus on his businesses. Trump's comments came hours after Musk posted hislatest complaintsabout the tax-and-spending bill on his social media platform X.\"Every member of Congress who campaigned on reducing government spending and then immediately voted for the biggest debt increase in history should hang their head in shame!\" Musk wrote. \"And they will lose their primary next year if it is the last thing I do on this Earth.\" Tesla shares entered Tuesday having lost more than a fifth of their value this year.

        "header": "Weekend and Holiday Trading: What You Can and Can\u2019t Do in 24-Hour Markets",
        "content": "Equities markets are increasingly trending toward 24-hour trading. The SEC approved a national securities exchange application from 24X National Exchange in November 2024, paving the way for a new exchange with extendedtrading hours beyond what is currently on offer. Evenpreexisting exchanges like the Nasdaqand the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) are moving in this direction; the NYSE announced in October\u00a02024 that it would extend trading hours on the NYSE Arca Equities Exchange to 22 hours per day. For investors, this may change the calculus of how to go about managing a portfolio and participating in trades. For now, many investors are relegated to trading on weekends or holidays\u2014examples ofafter-hours trading\u2014as a means of accessing certain financial markets during periods in which primary exchanges are closed. While this access opens up many opportunities, it also creates fresh risks for investors. In many cases, an investor can place an order on a trading platform on the weekend or over a holiday, but that transaction won\u2019t be executed until the market opens again. However, this could change as hours continue to expand for many exchanges. Some markets are more conducive to weekend trading than others. For example, the cryptocurrency market is famously open 24 hours per day, seven days per week. This gives cryptocurrency traders the opportunity to conduct transactions anytime they wish\u2014due to the decentralized and international nature of many crypto tokens, this is a crucial feature of the space. Another market withextended trading hoursis forex. Foreign exchange markets are typically open for 24 hours per day, five days per week. This means that, depending upon the location, the investor may be able to trade on the weekends in local time. Holding forex positions open over the weekend is possible, but it can lead toprice gaps, volatility, and other unanticipated effects related to global news and events. Rarely, brokers may facilitate trading\u2014oftentimes in synthetic markets\u2014on weekends. This is often limited to particular indices, commodities, cryptocurrency, and forex. Why might an investor trade on weekends? A key factor is the ability to respond tonews-driven opportunities. In some cases, being able to act on a trade based on news that breaks over the weekend can open up the potential for gains for an investor. Investors planning to trade on weekends should beware of separate pricing structures compared with trades executed while traditional markets are open. Brokers offering weekend trades may apply an increased \u201cweekend fee\u201d to positions held over a weekend. Investors should also expect negative impact on spreads and liquidity, as well as rollover charges or added commissions. Major exchanges like the NYSE and the Nasdaq are closed for many U.S. holidays. Keep in mind, though, that specific markets may be open for certain holidays due to the differences between federally and locally recognized holidays. For example, both the NYSE and the Nasdaq are open onVeterans Day. A handful of brokers may also provide some trading access on some holidays. These include discount online brokers like Robinhood, which offers cryptocurrency trading even if the U.S. stock markets are closed.Keep in mind also that much after-hours trading activity is done by institutional investors, so individual retail investors may be at a disadvantage in multiple ways. Some investors hold the belief in a so-called \u201choliday effect,\u201d which may lead to rallies leading up to holidays and dips following them. Stocks may also be impacted by holidays due to customer behavior; retailers, for example, might seehuge upticks in sales on Black Fridayor in the period leading up to Christmas each year. Most brokers will allow investors to place an order even when markets aren\u2019t open, such as over the weekend or on holidays. However, these orders will be kept pending and will not be executed until the market reopens, by which point prices, liquidity, and many other factors may have changed. Because of the 24/7 nature of the cryptocurrency space, investors can execute crypto trades on weekends or holidays without concern. However, that\u2019s not to say that trading volumes will always be the same, and investors may find it more difficult to execute trades at their desired price if fewer traders are active. As mentioned above, certain specialized stock indices\u2014such as the Weekend U.S. Tech 100 or other weekend indices offered by IG\u2014do offer weekend trades.Nonetheless, investors should be sure to understand the charges, risks, and processes associated with brokerages allowing trades on the weekend, as they are likely to be different from trades done during normal market hours. One thing that investors are not able to do when trading on the weekend or over holidays is execute trades for most traditional assets. This is a reason why weekend or holiday trading is inherently risky: the bid-ask spread you encounter during those periods may change significantly, along with the price and many other factors, by the time the trade actually executes upon the market reopening. Similarly, it is not possible to directly trade stocks on major exchanges during the weekend or on a holiday. However, it is possible to place orders for execution on the next day the exchange is open. Further, as mentioned above, there are specialized exchanges that are open on weekends. Additionally, investors may utilizeelectronic communication networks (ECNs), systems that match buy and sell orders without the use of an exchange, to make indirect trades. However, there are often limitations to what ECNs can accomplish, and they often come with lower liquidity and increased volatility. Even if you are able to find a way to complete trades over the weekend, on a holiday, or at a time when markets are generally not available, you should expect to have a difficult time accessing liquidity. This may be true even in the case of trades that would be easy to facilitate during regular trading hours. The NYSE has somewhat different trading hours for tape A and for tapes B and C\u2014including an early trading session for the latter group from 7:00 to 9:30 a.m. Eastern\u2014but the core trading window across the exchange is 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. on non-holiday weekdays.The Nasdaq has regular core trading session hours of 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. as well, plus an opening session from 4 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. and extended hours from 4:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. The stock market has generally followed a schedule close to normal business hours\u2014being open during the day on weekdays except for holidays. By closing on the weekend and overnight, markets consolidate trades within a shorter period of each day, helping to improve liquidity. This also allows time for the markets to receive and process news taking place outside of market hours. In U.S. markets, it is possible today trade at nightby trading during extended hours or using some of the methods described above. It is also possible to accomplish a similar goal by trading on international markets or using specialized exchanges that offer overnight trading. While there is a shift toward 24-hour trading and new, longer trading hours for even some of the most established stock exchanges, as of mid-2025, investors still have to find workarounds to be able to trade outside of normal market hours. This is possible to do in several ways\u2014by focusing on cryptocurrencies, forex, and other instruments that are not bound by traditional U.S. exchange hours; by utilizing specialized exchanges that offer overnight trading; or by setting up orders to be executed when the market opens again, for example. There are drawbacks to 24-hour trading, including lower liquidity, higher volatility, and the possibility ofskewed bid-ask spreads. Before attempting to trade on the weekend or over a holiday, it\u2019s wise to consider the risks and potential additional costs to do so.",

        "content": "It's normal for your financial goals to change, so it makes sense that you may want to switch from one brokerage to another. You may also want to break up with your broker if you're tired of paying fees or customer service hasn't been great. Maybe you just found abrokerwith a more intuitive website, better investment options, or additional perks. Whatever the reason, you can close your account with one broker and easily transfer to another. We'll guide you through the process in a few steps. Spend a little time researchingbrokersto learn about each company\u2014what types of financial products it offers, customer reviews, and reputation. You should also learn about potential transfer fees and how long it takes to complete a transfer. Don't forget to play around with each broker's website to get an idea of how intuitive it is. Once you've chosen a broker, double-check that it offers the kind of account you want to open. For example, brokers typically offer investment accounts andindividual retirement accounts (IRAs), but some may offer products such as international stocks, low-costoptions trading,mutual funds, andcryptocurrency.\u00a0Then, spend a few minutes providing your information in order to open your new brokerage account. In order to transfer your current investments to your new account, you'll typically need your current account statements and tax documents. Your new broker should give you transfer forms to complete using that information. Then, it will probably use an automatic transfer system to move your funds. After you provide your new broker with the transfer request, it's important that you don't trade, which can make the process more complicated or cause delays. Putting a pause on trading makes it easier to complete your transfer request, which should go through within a few days. Then, you can resume trading. After the transfer goes through, review your old and new accounts to check that all funds were moved successfully. If they weren't, reach out to your broker before you close your old account. If your funds have been completely transferred, contact your old broker's customer service department and explain that you'd like to close your account. The team will explain how long it takes and initiate the process. Once the account is closed, confirm that it's closed so you aren't charged fees going forward. The hardest part about breaking up with a broker is doing the research to find one that fits your financial needs. Fortunately, once you've found one, it's easy to transfer funds and close your old account. That said, if you're unsure about which broker to use or have questions about your investments, don't hesitate to speak with a trustedfinancial advisor.",

        "header": "Your IRA: Set It, But Don't Forget It",
        "content": "One of the great things aboutindividual retirement accounts(IRAs) is that they can significantlygrow your retirement savings, even with modest contributions. But you'll only see growth with proper management, and that requires more than just making regular contributions. It requires t intentional, strategic investing and monitoring your performance. The \"set it and forget it\" attitude that some people maintain can lead to missed opportunities and little to no returns. So if you want to see some momentum with your retirement savings, you have to use your IRA the right way. IRAs are powerful tools for long-term retirement savings. You contribute money to the account, then invest those funds in assets like stocks, bonds, ETFs, or mutual funds. Earnings grow tax-deferred in a traditional IRA or tax-free in aRoth IRA, helping the value of your account increase faster over time. However, too often, people only contribute to their IRA, completely forgetting about (or neglecting) the need to then invest that money. \u201cIt is pretty common for folks toleave IRA funds uninvested,\u201d saidJamie Clark, CFP and founder of Ruby Pebble Financial Planning. \u201cThey might hear 'make a (Roth) IRA contribution before the tax deadline!' and make said contribution, but then not actually invest the funds.\" If the funds just sit in cash (they may be placed in a money market fund), they lose value to inflation and miss out on compounding growth, the key benefit of retirement accounts. A few months or years without investing them can significantly delay your retirement timeline. \u201cMost retirement savings targets assume a certain level of return from investments,\u201d Clark told Investopedia. \u201cIf the funds are left uninvested, you are missing out on the value ofcompound interest, and it could take longer to reach your goals.\u201d A Vanguard survey of its investors who rolled 401(k)s into IRAs found that two-thirds of those who left their funds in cash did so unintentionally. In fact, 48% believed that the money would be invested automatically. Let\u2019s say you contribute $4,000 annually to an IRA invested in astock index fundaveraging a 10% annual return. Your account could grow to more than $720,000 over 30 years. But if you left that money uninvested in a money market fund, earning little to no interest, you\u2019d miss out on roughly $600,000 in potential growth (depending on the interest rate of the money market fund fund). Opening an IRA or rolling over funds from your previous employer's retirement plan is a great move, but it\u2019s only the first step. If you want to see real growth, you have to know how to manage the account effectively over time. Until your money is invested according to your goals and risk tolerance, your IRA can't do its job. \u201cFor most investors, it's a good idea to have a diversified portfolio,\" said Clark. \"You should acknowledge how old you are, how long it is until you will need the money, and over what time period you will withdraw this money.\" If you\u2019rerolling over an old retirement accountinto an IRA, it\u2019s important to handle the process carefully to avoid unexpected taxes or missed investment opportunities. Choosing the wrong type of IRA for your rollover\u2014for example, moving pretax funds into an after-tax Roth IRA\u2014can trigger a large, surprise tax bill. Delays in depositing a rollover checkcan also result in penalties or lost investment time in the market, which may reduce your long-term growth potential. \"It's ... important to be intentional with the flavor of the IRA when doing a rollover. If the prior account contained all pre-tax funds, depositing it fully into a Traditional IRA can help reduce unintended tax consequences.\" \"And lastly, you want to make sure to deposit the [rollover] check in a timely manner so you don't miss out on time in the market or risk additional tax consequences,\" said Clark. Once you invest, remember to perform regular check-ins to stay on track. At least once a year, you should review your investment choices, performance, fees, and whether your portfolio still aligns with your goals. \"You should review your IRA at least annually. Look for what it has been invested in, if there are any uninvested funds in the account, what the expense ratios are on the holdings, whether it's time to shift your asset allocation as you have gotten older and/or your risk tolerance has changed with recent performance, and whether your beneficiaries are still aligned with your wishes,\" advised Clark.\u00a0\"You could consider all of your investments together, not just the one IRA, as well,\" Another often overlooked step is rebalancing, which helps you keep your portfolio aligned with your target asset allocation and risk tolerance as market performance shifts. \"If you don't regularly rebalance back to your targetasset allocation, typically over time, your portfolio will shift more towards stocks than bonds because their rate of return tends to be higher historically. That can lead to higher volatility in your portfolio than you might be comfortable with,\" Clark explained. An IRA is more than just a tax-advantaged account\u2013it\u2019s also a long-term investment vehicle that requires regular attention and care. Simply funding it isn\u2019t enough. To truly benefit, you must invest the money, monitor the performance of your investments, and adjust your investment strategy periodically.",

        "content": "If you've been an individual investor for a while, you might be looking for ways to up your investment game. We're talking performing stock research and analysis like the pros, so you can make your own decisions instead of letting arobo advisorcall the shots. In addition to choosing your investments, you can also find deals on stocks that are trading for a discount and capture more of your investment growth. We'll offer strategies that give you more control over your investments and givestock brokersa run for their money. Astock screeneris a valuable set of tools that are available for free on brokerage sites or with a subscription on independent sites. With a stock screener, you set the investing parameters\u2014the more you include, the narrower your list of stock options becomes. Many investors use stock screeners to identify potential stocks and weed out ones they're not interested in. Then, they do additional analysis to learn more about an individual stock's performance. When investors try to determine how much a stock is worth, they might look at the face value of the stock (technical analysis) or try to learn how much a stock is actually worth. To conduct afundamental analysis, you might read a company's annual report and research a stock's: Using fundamental analysis can help you see past trends in the market and even find stocks that are poised for growth, making them ideal investment options. It can also help you spot stocks that are overvalued, making them a liability. Some investors prefer to use a company's historical performance to estimate price trends instead of its fundamentals. Specifically, investors look at the historical price and trading volume. This information can help you make short-term decisions about what a stock may do in the near future. For instance, if you're hoping to make large gains withswing trades, you'd want to look at thetechnical analysisof stocks. Fundamental analysis focuses on the long-term performance of stocks, while technical analysis pays more attention to short-term performance. Both are useful when researching the overallperformance of your stocks. Simply put, relative performance (RP) is how well stocks perform relative to other stocks or a specific market benchmark (like theS&P 500). It's usually shown as a percentage and can give you an idea of whether the stock is strong compared to similar options. To find relative performance, you need to choose a benchmark and a timeframe. A relative performance of over 1% means the stock is overperforming compared to its peers, so you may want to consider it as an investment option. To get an idea of how well a company is doing (and might perform over the next few weeks or months), you could run achannel check. A channel check is a way of assessing a company by learning about its distribution channels. An analyst might contact a company's suppliers to ask about upcoming supply and distribution. As an individual, you're a bit limited in running channel checks, but you could pay attention to larger issues affecting a company. For example, find out if any supply chain issues might disrupt the company, watch for product space on the shelves, and listen to public opinion about the company's business practices. These can all give you a read on whether the company is thriving (and whether its stock will do well in the future). Don't underestimate the usefulness of online research platforms. Popular investing websites often have useful (and free) tools that can teach you the ins and outs of investing. Many offer performance reports for specific stocks, access to a company's financial history, expert opinions, easy-to-use stock screeners, and more. It is possible to trade stocks without any information about them, but we wouldn't advise this since making informed decisions can optimize your portfolio's performance. From using stock screeners and playing around with online research platforms to using fundamental or technical analysis, you've got a handful of valuable research tools at your disposal. While you can rely on one strategy, combining several can give you a better understanding of your stock options. As always, you should do your due diligence and consider risk before making any financial moves.",

That's lifted stocks associated with AI, crypto\u2014and gold. How did we get here? It's been a ride. Stocksplummetedin early April after President Donald Trump unveiled sweeping global tariffs that threatened to scramble global supply chains, spike prices, and slow growth. Trump's subsequent pause of those tariffs, however,ignited a rallythat was further fueled bybenign economic dataand easing trade tensions. By the end of June, stocks had rebounded to record highs. Wall Street's latest rally has looked a bit like last year's bull market. Artificial intelligence continued to connect many of the market's winners. But a few new themes have emerged amid the Trump administration's shake-up of the status quo. Here, we'll examine the stock market's leaders from the first six months of 2025\u2014and examine how the forces underlying their gains could evolve in the next six. Crypto investors have been handsomely rewarded for the industry\u2019s spending on November\u2019s election. The industry last year spent more than $100 million in support of pro-crypto candidates. In January, the \u201cmost pro-crypto Congress\u201d in history was sworn in and Washington wasted little time giving the industry what it wanted. Federal regulators havedroppedpending litigation against cryptocurrency companies. Trumpsigned an executive orderestablishing a Bitcoin reserve. In May, the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, which would establish a framework for the regulation of cryptocurrencies, was introduced in the House of Representatives.And the Senate in Junepassed the GENIUS Act, legislation that establishes rules governing stablecoins. That's helped grow the cryptocurrency market's value to more than $3.2 trillion. Washington\u2019s embrace, however, has also boosted related stocks this year. Robinhood (HOOD) stock more than doubled in price in the first half, while Coinbase (COIN) shares rose 41%. Circle Internet Group\u2019s (CRCL) shares more than doubled during the stablecoin issuer\u2019s first day of trading in early June; the stock rose nearly 750% in the two weeks after its debut. The cryptocurrency legislation working its way through Congress is expected to have little trouble making its way to Trump\u2019s desk for signature in the second half of this year. Trump andhis familymay continue feeding the industry\u2019sanimal spiritswithnew crypto ventures. Analysts came into the year expecting the group of stocks considered emblematic of the AI trade to change. That has panned out to an extent. Leadership was expected to shift from AI infrastructure stocks\u2014companies like Nvidia (NVDA), whose chips fill the data centers that cloud computing giants like Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) use to train and run AI models\u2014to software and services providers developing and monetizing AI applications. Palantir (PLTR) was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 in the first half of the year; itsimpressive sales and earnings growthhave been driven primarily by its AI software. Social media giant Meta Platforms (META) is the Magnificent Seven\u2019s best performer year-to-date thanks in part to itssuccess introducing AI featuresthat have improved performance metrics. Software stocks are expected to continue to outperform as they improve AI models and develop new applications. They could also benefit from their relative insulation from trade uncertainty, which dented the overall stock market\u2019s returns in the first half. AI infrastructure, a theme that outperformed for most of 2024, continued to be a winner on Wall Street in the first half of this year. Tech giants Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet (GOOG), and Meta looked through economic uncertainty andstood by plansto cumulatively spend hundreds of billions of dollars on property, buildings, and equipment this year. Much of that spending is earmarked for the technology required to develop and run advanced AI, like Nvidia chips, Super Micro Computer (SMCI) servers, and Amphenol (APH) fiber optic cables. Those hardware suppliers saw their shares rise 18%, 61%, and 42%, respectively, in the first half. The buildout of power-hungry data centers boosted the stocks of nuclear power providers, whose electricity isin demand from tech companieswho say they are looking to shrink their carbon footprints. Shares of Constellation Energy (CEG) and Vistra (VST) advanced 44% and 41%, respectively. But bringing new nuclear power online is a long process, and data centers are in the meantime relying on natural gas, boosting the stocks of gas-fired plant operators like NRG Energy (NRG), up 78% year-to-date, and gas turbine makers like GE Vernova (GEV), up 61%. Experts expect the AI infrastructure trade to be resilient. Tech giants \u201care planning for long-term data center capacity requirements and won\u2019t alter their investment plans based on tariff regimes that change from week to week,\u201d said Shaon Baqui, tech equities analyst at Janus Henderson Investors. The mood globally in the first half of 2025 was tense, to put it mildly.\u00a0That was good for gold. In five months, the second Trump administration launched a global trade war targeting friends and foes alike; opened questions about America's commitment to longtime alliances like NATO; increased America\u2019s involvement in Israel\u2019s conflict with its neighbors; and ratcheted up tensions with China.\u00a0Investors who sought stability turned to gold, a time-honored safe-haven asset. Gold prices climbed to record high after record high, peaking at more than $3,450 on June 13, the day Israel launched attacks on Iran\u2019s nuclear program. Shares of gold miner Newmont (NEM) followed prices higher, rising 56% over the first half of the year. Fellow miners Barrick (B) and Agnico Eagle Mines (AEM) advanced 34% and 52%, respectively. Central banks, wary of inflation and their reliance onU.S.-controlled reserve assets, have been major buyers of gold in recent years. Demand for gold is expected to remain high for the foreseeable future as governments around the world seek to hedge against elevated geopolitical tensions and an uncertain global economic outlook. The World Gold Council\u2019s most recent Central Bank Gold Reserves survey found that nearly all central banks expect global gold reserves to increase over the next 12 months. A record 43% of respondents said they plan to add to their gold holdings over the same period.",

        "header": "Is Nvidia the Top Artificial Intelligence Stock to Buy in July?",
        "content": "As we reach the halfway mark in 2025, it's clear that artificial intelligence (AI) remains a dominant theme in the market. This hasn't changed since the start of 2023, so some investors may be becoming a bit fatigued from all the AI-related hype. However, the reality is that there has never been a larger investment theme. Most AI hyperscalers are projecting record capital expenditures for 2025, primarily focused on expanding their cloud computing capacity for AI applications. That will help one company more than any other:Nvidia(NVDA-2.87%). Nvidia has been the top AI stock pick for several years now, and it remains a strong choice for the future. But is it the best AI stock to buy in July? Image source: Getty Images. Nvidia manufacturesgraphics processing units (GPUs)-- chips that were originally designed to allow computers to generate high-quality graphics in video games. What allows them to do that so well is that these chips are parallel processors -- specifically suited to handling the types of computations that can easily be broken down into a large number of small tasks that can be handled simultaneously.\u00a0Among the types of high-performance workloads that fit that particular bill are training and running AI models. Nvidia has competitors in the data center GPU market, but none come close to the technology and supporting products that it offers. Most estimates peg its market share in that niche at around 90%, which is incredible considering the substantial amount of money spent on data centers. Data center spending is also projected to skyrocket over the next few years. During his keynote at Nvidia's 2025 GTC developer event, CEO Jensen Huang cited a third-party estimate that data center capital expenditures totaled $400 billion in 2024. Considering that Nvidia generated $115 billion in data center revenue during its fiscal 2025 (which encompassed most of 2024), it's clear that a solid chunk of that spending flowed its way. That same estimate also forecast that data center capital expenditures would rise to $1 trillion by 2028. If Nvidia can maintain its share of those expenditures, its revenue would more than double over that period. That presents quite the bullish case for Nvidia stock, and even if the actual spending comes in below the $1 trillion mark, the chipmaker's growth should still be impressive. AI computing capacity is far from being fully built out to the degree that the tech sector expects to need, which keeps the story behind Nvidia's stock intact. But is the stock priced at a reasonable level for new investors to capitalize on future growth? There's a common notion that Nvidia's stock has become quite expensive, but that's something investors need to get out of their heads. While it may have been true early on in the AI arms race, that's no longer the case. It trades today at36 times forward earnings, which is right around where some of its big tech peers are trading -- and Nvidia is growing at a faster rate than they are.  NVDA PE Ratio (Forward)data byYCharts. MicrosoftandAmazontrade for 37 and 34 times forward earnings, respectively. Yet during their most recently reported quarters, Microsoft grew its revenue at a 13% pace, while Amazon grew at a 9% pace. I'm not trying to argue that Nvidia is cheap, but its valuation is hovering around the same levels as its big tech peers. If its data center GPU sales grow at the rates that it expects, then the price today will be inconsequential years down the road. As a result, I'm confident inlabeling Nvidia as the best AI stock to buy in July.",

Shares dropped nearly 5% to just over $303 in recent trading, amid worries about anescalation in the feudbetween CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump over the president's signature \"One Big Beautiful Bill.\" Current options pricing suggests traders see shares moving about another 5% in either direction by the end of the week following the data's release.

Analysts from JPMorgan, William Blair, and Deutsche Bank warned clients they expect Tesla could miss delivery estimates as demand remains weak and competition grows. JPMorgan analysts wrote they \"see material risk to the outlook for full year deliveries also, given that consensus requires a sharp pivot from underperformance to outperformance of expected seasonal pattern despite the likely significant near-term curtailment of EV subsidies.\" The EV maker's stock has divided analysts, with 10 of those surveyed by Visible Alpha issuing \"buy\" or equivalent ratings, with four \"hold\" and four \"sell\" ratings.

        "content": "Saving money is an important financial habit, but not all saving is helpful or healthy. In fact, many people save for reasons that are more emotional than strategic. Here are some of the misguided reasons why people save. Fear-based saving often stems frompast financial traumaor hardship. Perhaps, you grew up in a household where your parents regularly had arguments about not being able to afford the bills. Fear-based saving can manifest in subtle yet powerful ways, likemoney anxiety, avoidance behaviors, or obsessive account checking. It is often fueled by a scarcity mindset: the constant belief that there will never be enough. \u201cScarcity mindset and/or having lived through a hard time when resources have been slim could lead someone to save out of fear. Knowing what it feels like to live through not having enough could cause anyone to attempt to safeguard resources,\" saidAja Evans, financial therapist at Aja Evans Counseling. Many people save not out of personal intention, but because of passed-down beliefs and a mindset that frames saving as the morally right or responsible thing to do. \u201cThe generations that raised Gen Z and millennials tend to have had a mindset of \u2018saving is best.\u2019 The \u2018right\u2019 thing to do with your money was to save it,\" Evans explained. \"Those messages that many of us received left a hole in understanding what the purpose was. It comes back to your personal money beliefs, where or who they came from, and whether or not those beliefs fit your current life.\" For example, if you start stockpiling cash without a clear purpose for it, you could end up with too much cash, losing out on potential gains that you could have earned frominvesting in ETFs or stocksinstead.\u201cYou should have a goal or milestone that you would eventually like to get to, hit it, and move on to the next goal or allow yourself more breathing room in your financial life,\" Evans told Investopedia. People who haven\u2019t learned how tospend with intentionoften default to saving because it feels safer, yet they might miss out on the joy and happiness that can come from spending, such as embarking on a vacation with friends or purchasing a special item of clothing. Reframing your mindset about saving requires you to examine the root causes for your saving.This will help you better understand your current beliefs and work towards ahealthier mindset. \u201cFor many of us, it is complex work because it can involve our upbringing or the viewpoints of our family. That can get sensitive and hard to examine quite quickly,\" Evans stated. Ask yourself these qeustions: \"Examining your own money beliefs and deciding if they are helping or hindering you, and then taking the time to bring awareness to your actions, is worthwhile. While your financial habits may be mindless sometimes, I want my clients and people in general to start being mindful about their money, emotions, and actions they take with their finances,\" said Evans. Give yourself permission to imagine a future that excites you, not one built on fear, pressure, or someone else\u2019s expectations. According to a 2024 Bank of America study, Gen Z and millennials are specificallysaving to pay down debt, go on vacation, and/or purchase new vehicles and homes. \"When yourfinancial goals align with your values, it is much easier to crush those goals. Working towards a goal can be very motivating, seeing your progress, how far you\u2019ve come, and watching your mindset shift during the journey can keep momentum going,\" Evans explained. Once your goals are clear, it\u2019s time to build the financial habits that can help you reach them. According to Evans, \"For some people, that may meanautomating your savingsso it just goes to the account automatically, hiding your savings account in a different account you don\u2019t have attached to your regular use money, orpaying yourself first.\" Saving is a smart move, but saving without understanding why you're doing it can leave you with a lot of mixed emotions. When you save with purpose, your money gains meaning, and your choices start to support the life you truly want. That clarity can turn saving from a burden into a powerful, intentional habit.",

The potential to quickly secure a huge gain with a defined maximum loss appeals to many retail investors. However, there are strings attached, and, as is the case withhigh-risk, high-reward gambles, the losers far outnumber the winners. Zero-day-to-expiry options arefinancial derivativesthat give investors the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at an agreed-upon price by the end of the trading day, in exchange for a fee known as the premium. Historically, these options were used by institutional investors to hedge against large price swings on days when information, known to shift valuations, was due out, such as inflation numbers or Federal Reserve interest rate decisions. Now they are in the mainstream and regularly used by retail investors to bet on whether a particular stock market index will rise or fall by the end of the day. 0DTE options are not limited to stock market indexes and popular exchange-traded funds. Any stock, ETF, or stock index will have a 0DTE option at least on the expiry day. Options may expire weekly, monthly, or quarterly. Popular stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (MSFT), and Tesla, Inc. (TSLA), may trade 0DTE options more frequently. A 2024 study by researchers at the University of M\u00fcnster found thattransaction costs accounted for 70%of total 0DTE options losses. This means that even if retail investors were breaking even on their actual bets, they'd still be losing massive amounts just from the fees charged to enter and exit trades. The appeal of zero-day options is understandable, especially whenmarkets are volatile. For speculators, they offer the chance to make a lot of money in a short timeframe. 0DTE options are relatively cheap to buy, the amount that can be lost is established at the onset, and within a few hours it\u2019s possible, if the position enters the money before it expires, to walk away with a windfall. Some investors also use 0DTE options for what they were originally designed for: insurance against unexpected market movements. For instance, if you hold a bank stock, you could consider buying a 0DTE put option on it on the days when inflation or federal funds rate figures are published. Doing so would protect you if the numbers are worse than feared and the share price falls. Some Wall St. onlookers like CNBC host Jim Cramer have compared zero-day options to casino gaming because they offer a big payout in exchange for a fee and very rarely deliver on their potential. These contracts, he has said, represent gambling, not investing, and could lead to addiction. Skeptics argue that part of the trap is the seemingly affordable costs. Because these options expire by the end of the day, their premiums are quite low. However, the fees quickly add up and drain accounts over time, particularly as most zero-day options expire worthless. Research from the University of M\u00fcnster reveals a troubling dynamic in the 0DTE market. They analyzed millions of trades and discovered thatsophisticated traders with high conviction\u2014those placing most of the larger orders\u2014are predominantly selling 0DTE options, while retail investors are overwhelmingly buying them. This creates what could amount to a predator-prey relationship: knowledgeable traders are essentially running a casino, collecting premiums from retail investors who might think they're making shrewd bets. The data shows these sellers are raking in profits while buyers consistently lose money, suggesting retail traders are funding the gains of more sophisticated traders betting against them. Zero-day options can be useful to hedge short-term market moves and make quick gains. However, their entering the mainstream shouldn\u2019t necessarily be celebrated. Experts reviewing the data have found that these options amplify price movements, could destabilize financial markets, and, for many traders, amount to a form of gambling.",

        "header": "3 Top Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Not Named Nvidia",
        "content": "Wall Street bulls pushed the stock market to new all-time highs to end June, as investors bet on a cease-fire deal in the Middle East. The strong end to the second quarter capped off a historic rebound from the early April lows. The Nasdaq soared over 33% since April 8, driven by mouth-watering gains from Nvidia and other growth stocks benefiting from the artificial intelligence revolution. The market might face some near-term selling pressure and volatility in the coming weeks. Still, the combination of trade deals, cooling inflation, and strong earnings growth expectations provide a bullish launching pad for stocks in the second half. The S&P 500 has also posted a positive July for 10 straight years. Let's dive into three highly-ranked Zacks stocks benefiting directly from the artificial intelligence spending boom to consider buying in July. Behind-the-scenes technology stockVertiv (VRT)soared1,445% in the past three years to outclimb AI chip powerhouse Nvidia\u2019s 990% charge. The digital infrastructure and continuity solutions company is poised to benefit from the AI spending boom and become a long-term AI winner no matter who commercializes artificial intelligence and which AI hyperscalers gain the largest market share. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Vertiv\u2019s hardware, software, analytics, and ongoing services portfolio is focused on power, cooling, and IT infrastructure, operating across AI data centers, communication networks, and commercial/industrial environments. The Ohio-based firm\u2019s growing portfolio helps make sure the high-density computing power that drives technological innovation and the economy runs as smoothly as possible 24/7. VRT, which has partnered with Nvidia (NVDA) to help solve critical AI challenges such as cooling, averaged 16% revenue growth in the past four years. \"We continue to see accelerated scaling of AI deployments across the data center market, with strong demand signals reinforcing both our near- and long-term growth outlook\u2026 Our partnership with NVIDIA and our reference designs for their GB200 and GB300 NVL72 platforms position Vertiv at the forefront of AI factory deployment at industrial scale,\u201d CEO Giordano Albertazzi said in prepared remarks last quarter. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Vertiv is projected to grow its revenue by 19% in 2025 and 14% next year to $10.87 billion\u2014double its 2021 total. The soaring tech company is expected to boost its adjusted earnings by 25% and 24%, respectively, following 60% growth in 2024 and 236% in 2023. VRT reaffirmed its 2025 outlook in late May, and its upbeat EPS revisions earn it a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Wall Street loves the dividend-paying AI stock, with 15 of the 19 brokerage recommendations we have at \u201cStrong Buys.\u201d Despite its Nvidia-beating run over the past three years, VRT trades 16% below its highs and it\u2019s on the verge of completing the bullish golden cross where the shorter-dated 50-day moving average climbs above the 200-day. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Vertiv trades at a 30% discount to its highs at 32.1X forward 12-month earnings. Its strong longer-term earnings growth outlook helps the stock trade at a 33% discount to Tech, even though VRT has crushed the sector over the past five years. Physically building the most complex, cutting-edge semiconductors in the world makesTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM)a straightforward, all-encompassing tech investment across AI, electronics, and future tech innovations. Taiwan Semi\u2019s foundry-only model slowly transformed it into one oftheonly games in town for semiconductor manufacturing, especially at the bleeding edge. This backdrop is why TSM stock has skyrocketed 2,600% over the past 20 years, more than tripling the Tech sector's performance. Taiwan Semi reportedly holds a roughly 60% share of the entire foundry market and 90% of advanced chip manufacturing, boasting Apple and other tech titans as key clients. Nvidia\u2019s massive AI expansion likely wouldn\u2019t be possible without TSMC. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research TSMC is also critically addressing its geopolitical fears by expanding its manufacturing footprint outside Taiwan into Japan and the U.S. Taiwan Semi pays a dividend, and its balance sheet is solid. Taiwan Semi is boosting its industry-leading 3-nanometer production, fueled by demand from AI chip companies Nvidia and AMD. The pure-play foundry company said 3nm chips accounted for 22% of total wafer revenue in the first quarter of 2025, up from 9% in the year-ago period, with advanced technologies accounting for 73%. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research TSMC is projected to grow its revenue by 29% in FY25 and 17% in FY26 (following a 25% expansion last year) to surge from $90 billion in 2024 to $137 billion in 2026. Taiwan Semi is projected to grow its adjusted earnings by 32% in FY25 and 16% next year. The company\u2019s recent positive earnings revisions earn it a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and extend its stretch of improving, AI-boosted earnings growth. And TSMC has topped our estimates for nearly five years running. Taiwan Semi stock might be a little overheated from a technical standpoint after its massive rally saw it\u00a0hit new highs at the end of June alongside Nvidia and other tech standouts. That said, TSMC still trades at a 33% discount to its highs and 18% below Tech at 22.6X forward 12-month earnings. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Any pullback to its 21-day or 50-day moving averages could represent a more enticing buying opportunity. Others might want to wait for its second-quarter earnings release on July 17. Long-term investors might avoid the market timing game and buy TSMC now. MYR Group Inc.MYRGisaU.S.-based specialty contractor that builds and maintains electrical infrastructure, such as power lines and substations, for utilities, renewable energy projects, and beyond. The electric construction firm\u2019s growth outlook is stellar.MYR Group isset to ride the massive energy and electrification infrastructure spending boom that\u2019s just kicking off due to soaring AI energy demand and decades of underspending on critical energy infrastructure.

MYR Group\u2019s Commercial and Industrial unit provides electrical wiring, maintenance, and repair services for a diverse range of facilities, including airports, hospitals, AI data centers, industrial plants, as well as clean energy infrastructure. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research MYR Group went on a massive run between 2017 and 2023, before facing short-term setbacks in 2024, driven by project delays, cost overruns in clean energy contracts, and more. MYRG\u2019s beat-and-raise first quarter helps it earn a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Its backlog jumped 8% YoY in Q1 to $2.43 billion. MYRG is projected to grow its revenue by 3% and 6%, respectively, in 2025 and 2026. Better yet, its earnings are expected to bounce back massively after a rough 2024 to the tune of 260% growth in 2025 and 14% next year to reach $7.48 a share, blowing away its previous 2023 record of $5.42 a share. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research The electric construction stock climbed 960% in the past 15 years, crushing the Utilities sector\u2019s 45% and the S&P 500's 480%, including a 450% surge in the past five years.

(IBM) is again surprising skeptics. Once written off as a lumbering mainframe relic, \u201cBig Blue\u201d has again captured Wall Street\u2019s attention with a fresh strategy that combines hybrid cloud, artificial intelligence, and an ambitious, long-term play inquantum computing, which has given it a head start in one of the most significant mid-2020s tech trends. Revenues are growing again, its stock reached an all-time high in February 2025, and CEO Arvind Krishna is credibly pitching IBM as the platform provider for the next era of enterprise tech. How did a 114-year-old company reverse decades of stagnation? The answer lies in an unbroken habit of reinvention\u2014from punch-cards to quantum bits\u2014that is once more reshaping IBM\u2019s future. IBM\u2019s story begins with Herman Hollerith\u2019s electromechanical tabulators in the 1890s and the 1911 merger that created the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company, renamed IBM in 1924.Punched cards became the data medium of the 20th century, and by the 1960s, IBM\u2019s System/360 mainframe made \u201cBig Blue\u201d synonymous with enterprise computing. That glory, though, faded fast. By 1993, increased competition, scrappy Silicon Valley startups, and collapsing hardware margins left IBM with billions in losses and a breakup plan on the boardroom table as its personal computer and server businesses lagged. Incoming CEO Lou Gerstner stopped the split, slashed costs, and pivoted the company toward integrated services\u2014a first major rescue that restored profitability by the late 1990s.

        "content": "Robinhood Markets, Inc.HOOD stock surged 12.8% on Monday after launching new crypto offerings for European and U.S. users. The trading platform\u2019s shares have now spiked more than 300% in the past year, raising thoughts of a buying opportunity. Let\u2019s find out \u2013 Robinhood aims to become a comprehensive financial services company, not just a hub for meme stock traders. Crypto is expected to play a key role in achieving this goal. Robinhood is adding more than 200 U.S. stocks and ETF tokens, includingApple Inc.AAPL andNVIDIA CorporationNVDA, to its platform in the EU to give European users access to American equities. Tokenized stocks, popular among crypto enthusiasts, mimic underlying equities but utilize blockchain technology instead of traditional exchanges. Additionally, EU customers will have access to crypto perpetual futures for leveraged exposure to volatile assets. The company plans to introduce this product in the United States if crypto futures receive approval from the CFTC. Robinhood also launched crypto staking for U.S. users to expand its offerings and compete with crypto-native exchanges, such asCoinbase Global, Inc.COIN. This feature will also be available to customers in the EU and the European Economic Area. Driven by these developments, Robinhood\u2019s shares have risen. To tap into the booming cryptocurrency market, Robinhood acquired a cryptocurrency exchange, Bitstamp, for $200 million. This has enabled Robinhood to combine its cryptocurrency, options, and equities trading capabilities, establishing its status as an innovator in the finance field, which will boost the company\u2019s future valuations. Additionally, trade tariffs led to increased volatility in the S&P 500, causing a rise in trading activity. These higher trading volumes improved Robinhood\u2019s first-quarter results, with revenues jumping 50% year over year to $927 million and earnings per share reaching 37 cents, up 106% year over year. The company\u2019s management also announced that they have seen strong customer engagement in the second quarter. Increased customer engagement, Bitstamp acquisition, tokenized trading launch in the EU, and expanded crypto offerings are acting as tailwinds for Robinhood stock. In reality, Robinhood has a higher net profit margin of 48.8% than the Financial - Investment Bank industry\u2019s 16.1%, indicating strong growth potential. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Shares of Robinhood are currently trading above both the short-term 50-day moving average (DMA) and the long-term 200 DMA, further indicating a positive trend. Therefore, stakeholders are advised to retain their shares. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Robinhood, however, is currently trading at a fairly hefty valuation. Per the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, Robinhood trades at 76.12 times forward earnings, while the industry\u2019s forward earnings multiple is 15.44. So, new buyers should be cautious because any lack of growth could lead to a major correction in Robinhood stock.

        "header": "Nearly Half of Americans in Their Peak Earning Years Worry About Retirement Every Single Day",
        "content": "For many Americans, retirement is a constant worry. According toBlackRock, 47% of Americans between the ages of 45 to 54 worry about their retirement savings at least once a day.These financial moves will help to assuage some of those worries. \"It\u2019s common for Gen Xers to feel squeezed between saving for retirement and living a meaningful life now. The good news is that they are achieving peak incomes,\" said Preston Cherry, CFP and founder ofConcurrent Wealth. Here's how Gen Xers can move into greater retirement savings and less worry. When it comes to retirement savings, young investors have an advantage because the money they invest has the advantage of growing with compound interest over several decades. Assuming average stock market returns of 6% to 7%, every dollar you invest now can triple or quadruple by the time you retire. People in their 40s and 50s have shorter time horizons, but investing 10 to 20 years out from retirement can still make a difference in their retirement savings. If you aren't already doing so,automate your retirement savings strategy. Put aside money each paycheck or each month. These steady payments can help your retirement savings grow, and they can also help to calm some of the panic you may be feeling about retirement. You should alsoestablish an emergency fund. Put three to six months of living expenses in ahigh-yield savings account, and only reach for it in times of an emergency. This will reduce the temptation to tap your retirement funds for surprise expenses, which can potentially incur hefty penalties. A 401(k) or similar tax-advantaged plan is a great way to build up your retirement savings, especially if it comes with a matching contribution from your employer. As a rule of thumb,investing 10% to 15% of each paycheckis a good goal. In 2025, you can contribute as much as $23,500 in a 401(k). This amount goes up to $70,000 when your contributions are combined with your employer's contributions. If you are in your 50s, you may invest in acatch-up contributionof $7,500 into your 401(k). Individual retirement accounts\u2014like atraditional IRA or a Roth IRA\u2014are other great ways to save for retirement. Both have contribution limits of $7,000 for 2025. Those age 50 older can make a catch-up contribution of $1,000. Cherry encourages Gen Xers to align their financial plans with their values, lifestyle needs, and long-term goals. \"This is what I call lifestyle-aligned wealth planning. It\u2019s not just about how much you save, but how intentionally you save,\" Cherry advises. \"When you know your\u00a0retirement rate\u2014which is how much you need to fund [your retirement] annually\u2014your\u00a0retirement date,when you want to be work-optional, you\u2019re no longer guessing. You\u2019re designing your life with clarity and confidence.\" To get started, you'll need to be honest with yourself about the state of your retirement savings and where you would like to be headed. \"The keys are being honest, giving yourself grace for where you are, being confident, and committing\u00a0to where you want to go,\" Cherry said. For most people, the years between ages 45 and 54 are peak years for income, but many still worry about being able to afford retirement. The best way to beat these worries is through action. Start saving regularly, and contribute as much as you can to tax-advantaged retirement plans, like 401(k)s and IRA accounts. Taking charge of your investments and savings is the best way to ease your concerns about retirement.",

The opportunities are huge, but so are the prospects of going bust. Many space projects require significant initial investments that won\u2019t generate a return for a long time, if ever. Taking an idea from the initial phase to the point where it can be profitable at scale doesn\u2019t happen overnight, and there\u2019s a chance regulators, government contracts, or competition could ruin everything. This also makes forvolatile share prices. Investors tend to be idealists, pricing growth stocks based on the company\u2019s long-term potential. Any bumps in the road or calls for extra funding, which are common, can lead to huge sell-offs. A good example is Virgin Galactic Holdings (SPCE). Shares in the British-American spaceflight company have fallen 98% over the past five years and now cost under $3 apiece. A lower-risk path into space is via certain aerospace and defense (A&D) stocks. These companies are mainly known formanufacturing aircraft components, military systems, or both. That expertise can lead them into growth sectors with crossover, including space. A&D companies with significant space operations include: If the space economy lives up to its high expectations, these companies will likely make money from it. The downside is that you don't get full exposure, diversification reduces upside potential, and some investors object to holding shares in defense companies for ideological reasons. A burgeoning space sector led to the launch of a series of space-focused ETFs. These ETFs give investors the opportunity to hold a variety of space companies rather than try to pick single winners. This is appealing in a sector where stock picking is extremely hard and the companies leading the way frequently drop back. However, note that each ETF's exposure to space varies considerably. Popular space ETFs include: Before investing, make sure youstudy expense ratiosand how the ETF works, including its methodology, area of focus, and holdings. Chasing the dizzying returns space can offer is exciting. It can also be extremely expensive and stressful. Pure-play space stocks remain venture-style bets\u2014volatile, capital-hungry, and often pre-revenue-generating. For most investors, the best way to tap into this high-growth sector is byspreading your bets via an ETF, but be sure to read the fine print about what exactly you're buying.",

        "content": "Markets saw a movement away from the tech sector, which had previously dominated the recovery of U.S. equities. In foreign exchange markets the U.S. dollar maintained its current downward trajectory, while the euro strengthened. Both factors have been driving investors toward European stocks. The Dow Jones rose 396 points, for a 1% gain, on Tuesday, as investors mostly rotated out of the tech sector. That shift favored the 30-company Dow Jones, which is a 1% off its all-time high reached in December 2024. Meanwhile the S&P 500 fell 0.11% and theNasdaqdropped 0.83%. Several of the tech giants saw their share prices fall.Nvidiaclosed down 3%;Microsoftdeclined 1.1%; andMetaended the day 2.6% below where it opened. Teslahad the steepest drop, closing at $302 a share, 5.3% lower than at the start of the session, though some of that fall may be attributed to chief executive Elon Musk\u2019srenewed feudwith President Donald Trump. Across the pond, European markets came into focus on Tuesday after reports of investors shifting money into the continent intensified. However, stocks in the European Union tumbled on the day. The Stoxx 600 dropped 0.2% after a turbulent few days in which the index had multiple peaks and valleys. The German DAX spent the entire session in a negative slide, closing down 1%. The French CAC closed slightly lower, down four basis points for the day. There was a regional bright spot in the United Kingdom where the FTSE 100 rose 0.3% In currency markets the U.S. dollar index (DXY) was essentially flat on the day, after surging in the morning. On Tuesday the DXY was down 0.1%, hovering around $96.76. That comes after the U.S. dollar had its worst performance in the first half of a calendar year since 1973. Since the start of the year the U.S. dollar declined 11% against a basket of similar currencies. The ongoing weakness in the dollar reflects the sense of uncertainty that has pervaded the economy in the last few months. But the dollar\u2019s slide has been the euro\u2019s rally. The euro is up just under 14% so far year-to-date against the dollar. On Tuesday, the euro spiked in the morning hours, going as high as $1.1832, before falling back down to $1.1765 in the mid-afternoon. European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde called the exchange rate \u201ca reflection of the strength of our economy\u201d during the ECB Forum in Sintra, Portugal on Tuesday. \u201cThere has been a clear appreciation relative to the dollar,\u201d she said on a panel with other central bankers, including Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell. \u201cDepending on how you look at it, it\u2019s either depreciation of the dollar or appreciation of the euro, and there might be a bit of both.\u201d As the euro and the dollar move in opposite directions, investors have started rebalancing their portfolios toward European equities. The combination of greater stability in Europe, appreciation of the euro, and increased levels of defense spending have combined to make the European Union a more appealing destination for investors than it had been in recent years. \u201cIn that particular case, we\u2019re also looking at the movement, the flow of capitals and the attractiveness of euro-denominated assets, which is also an interesting phenomena that we\u2019ve observed lately,\u201d Lagarde said.

        "content": "The full article continues below these offers from our partners. With thestock market on a rollfor the last two months, but economic uncertainty still lingering for the rest of this year, you may be considering taking your 2025Required Minimum Distribution (RMD)sooner rather than later. While retirement account holders age 73 or older aren't required to withdraw funds until the end of December, taking your RMD now could allow you to sell fewer shares of stocks or index funds to meet the minimum. Even if you don\u2019t need your RMD funds right away, it can still be a smart move since returns on cash savings are excellent right now. With theFederal Reserve'sbenchmark interest rate still on hold\u2014and no 2025 rate cuts expected before September\u2014you can easily earn 4%\u20135% on your savings with virtually no risk.With some options, you can even lock in a guaranteed return for months or years. One of the best ways to earn a solid return on RMD funds you don\u2019t need right now is by parking them in one of the country\u2019stop high-yield savings accounts. We track the best-paying options every business day, and the current top rate is 5.00% APY. Even if the top-rate accounts don't meet your needs, our daily ranking of the best savings accounts has nearly 20 other options paying 4.30% or better. However, there are some downsides to consider. Savings account rates arevariable, so there\u2019s no guarantee of future returns. The rate you earn depends on what the Federal Reserve does with its benchmark rate, and there's no way to predict what any given account will pay later this year or in 2026. For now, though, high-yield savings accounts are riding a high, offering great returns that could last several more months. Although checking accounts aren\u2019t typically known for earning high returns, astandout option from mph.bankis currently offering 5.00% APY for any month in which at least $2,000 in direct deposits are received. If this requirement is manageable for you, consider opening the account and using it as a savings vehicle for your RMD or other funds. While\u00a0savings account rates can drop anytime,certificates of deposit (CDs)offer a fixed and guaranteed return. You can lock in your rate for a few months or up to several years. Of course, a predictable rate isn\u2019t worth much if the return is subpar, which is why today\u2019s CDs are such a good option. Thanks to the Federal Reserve\u2019s historic rate hikes of 2022\u20132023,the best CDsare still offering mid-4% returns across all of the major terms. Just keep in mind that securing a CD\u2019s rate requires committing your funds for the full term. If you cash out before maturity, you\u2019ll face anearly withdrawal penalty, which can vary from mild to severe among institutions. So it's smart to choose your term wisely and then research the early withdrawal penalty of CDs you're considering. I bondsare so-named because they're designed to pay a rate that tracks inflation, making them a reliable way to ensure your cash savings always outpace what you'll lose to inflationary price increases. This is especially beneficial for long-term investors\u2014such as retirees\u2014who want to keep some savings in a safe, predictable vehicle. I bonds can be held for up to 30 years, with their interest rate adjusting every six months based on the latestinflationtrends. Each person can purchase up to $10,000 in electronic I bonds per year. In addition, those receiving a tax refund can buy up to $5,000 more in paper I bonds using their refund.Some older investors routinely buy $10,000 to $15,000 in I bonds annually\u2014stockpiling them until needed, knowing they will always earn an inflation-beating return. Currently, new I bonds issued by Oct. 31 are paying 3.98% for the first six months.While that's lower than you can lock in with a CD, if inflation rises, your I bond rate will also rise. Additionally, the interest earned on I bonds is exempt from state income tax. Want to consider Treasuries? On Fridays, we publish the top rates for all types of cash accounts. There you can find themost recent Treasury ratesfor bonds from 1 month to 30 years. We update these rankings every business day to give you the best deposit rates available: Note that the \"top rates\" quoted here are the highest nationally available rates Investopedia has identified in its daily rate research on hundreds of banks and credit unions. This is much different than the national average, which includes all banks offering a CD with that term, including many large banks that pay a pittance in interest. Thus, the national averages are always quite low, while the top rates you can unearth by shopping around are often 5, 10, or even 15 times higher. Every business day, Investopedia tracks the rate data of more than 200 banks and credit unions that offer CDs and savings accounts to customers nationwide and determines daily rankings of the top-paying accounts. To qualify for our lists, the institution must be federally insured (FDICfor banks,NCUAfor credit unions), and the account's minimum initial deposit must not exceed $25,000. It also cannot specify amaximumdeposit amount that's below $5,000. Banks must be available in at least 40 states to qualify as nationally available. And while some credit unions require you to donate to a specific charity or association to become a member if you don't meet other eligibility criteria (e.g., you don't live in a certain area or work in a certain kind of job), we exclude credit unions whose donation requirement is $40 or more.
