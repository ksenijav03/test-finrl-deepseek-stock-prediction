        "content": "Chicago, IL \u2013 June 23, 2025 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights NVIDIA NVDA, Apple AAPL, Alphabet GOOGL, Meta Platforms META and Advanced Micro Devices AMD. Welcome back to The Week in AI. I'm Kevin Cook, your field guide and storyteller for the fascinating arena of artificial intelligence. On Friday, my colleague Ethan Feller and I ran through a dozen developments that are transforming the economy right before our eyes. Here were 7 of the highlights... 1) Jensen at NVIDIA GTC Paris: \"We are going to sell hundreds of billions worth of GB200/300.\" CEO Jensen Huang has forecast spending on AI-enabled data centers will double to $2 trillion over the next four to five years. As Grace Blackwell systems deploy, with 208 billion transistors per GPU -- or nearly 15 trillion per GB200 NVL72 rack system --NVIDIAengineers are building the roadmap for Rubin and Feynman systems with likely orders of magnitude greater power. This is something I've talked about repeatedly for the past year: Wall Street analysts and investors are vastly underestimating the potential of the AI economy and the upgrades in infrastructure that need to occur to support self-driving cars, humanoid robots, and other autonomous machines. And this doesn't include sovereign nation-states that need to build their own AI infrastructure for security and growth. If you ever need clarity about the AI Revolution, or just to recalibrate your expectations and convictions, there is one place you need to visit: the NVIDIA Newsroom -- especially around a GPU Tech Conference (GTC). (I show you where in the video.) For last week's Paris GTC, they rolled out 6 press releases and 19 blogs covering as many new innovations and partnerships across industry, enterprise, science and healthcare. Jensen also retells the story of the first DGX-1 in 2016. It was the mini supercomputer about the size of a college dorm fridge and it held 8 Volta GPUs with 21 billion transistors each. And nobody wanted it. Except a little startup called OpenAI. I like to use this story as an example of how NVIDIA has been in a very unique position ever since. They don't have to find \"product-market fit\" like most companies. Instead, they have been inventing a stack that developers didn't know they needed. Get the whole story in the replay of last Friday's The Week in AI: The Reasoning Wars, Sam's Love Letter, Zuck's Land Grab. Even if you don't have time for the 60-minute replay, at least do a quick scroll of the comments where I post all the relevant links to the topics we discussed. With over 25 links, you are guaranteed to find something that answers your top questions about the AI revolution! 2) The New Civil War In AI: Not Safety, But Efficacy There are many exciting debates going on in \"the revolution\" right now. A recent hot conflict is over whether or not the LLMs (large language models) are doing real reasoning, and even thinking. This one heated up afterAppleresearchers released their paper \"The Illusion of Thinking: Understanding the Strengths and Limitations of Reasoning Models.\" We are amazed by the research, writing, pattern-finding and puzzle-solving of these models. But Apple researchers found some limitations where the models \"give up\" on large problems without enough context. And it's worth pondering if they are simply \"token prediction\" machines that eventually get wrapped around their own axles. I've experienced this with some of the \"vibe-coding\" app developer tools like Replit and Bolt. But then other analysts and papers quickly responded and surfaced with the \"limitations\" of the Apple research, suggesting that the imposed cost expenditure limits imposed were the defining factor in the models giving up. One of the rebuttal papers was titled \"The Illusion of the Illusion of Thinking.\" Again, all these links are in the comments section of The Week in AI. 3) Google Offers Buyouts: AI Headcount Crunch Beginning? My third topic was once again about the employment impact from generative AI and agentic AI being adopted in corporations. I ran a query on ChatGPT for the \"top 100 jobs most likely to be disrupted\" in the next 3 years. You can find the link in the comments of the X Space. Another tangible angle on job displacement was the revolutionary ad during the NBA finals by the prediction market platform Kalshi. It was created using the new Veo 3 graphics creator from Google by a filmmaker named PJ Ace. Ethan and I discussed how this innovation is certain to disrupt advertising, marketing, and film as the machines can do in minutes what it used to take a team of people weeks. And wait until you see the new Veo 3 ad from a Los Angeles dentist that is taking social media by storm. We'll talk about that in this Friday's Space. But the most eye-opening news flash for me was the story on a company called Mechanize. While lots of job displacement will happen organically, this outfit is like a mercenary going after headcount. The New York Times titled their article \"This A.I. Company Wants to Take Your Job.\" And here's how an X post described the piece about the startup that wants to automate white-collar work \"as fast as possible\"... \"Mechanize wants to abolish all jobs. They make no secret of this. They are developing an AI program that is extremely promising and is being financed by everyone from Google to Stripe.\" Then there is Anthropic co-founder Ben Mann saying we'll know AI is transformative when it passes the \"Economic Turing Test: Give an AI agent a job for a month. Let the hiring manager choose: human or machine? When they pick the machine more often than not, we've crossed the threshold.\" I have several posts in the comments of the \"The Week in AI\" X Space on the employment wars. Plus, just about every post is from a particular source of AI insight or expertise whose account you should be following on X. 4) Marc Andreessen: \"All incumbents are gonna get nuked. Everything gets rebuilt.\" Translation:AI isn't an economic upgrade. It's a total reset. Which brings me to my favorite part of our Friday X Space... Cooker's RANT of the WEEK: \"The Magical AI Transformation Won't Be So Gentle.\" Here I take the other side of Sam Altman's blog post from last week titled \"The Gentle Singularity.\" I call it his \"love letter\" not to make fun of him, but to highlight his optimism in the face of brewing storms. A few weeks ago it was Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei warning us about the rapid disruption of work and its impacts on citizens and families, not just the economy. Then the old wise-man of AI, Geoffrey Hinton, shared these sentiments in a recent interview... The best-case future is a \"symbiosis between people and AI\" -- where machines handle the mundane, and humans live more interesting lives. But in the kind of society we have now, he warns, AI won't free most people. It will concentrate power, and as massive productivity increases create joblessness, it will mostly benefit the rich. This sober view instantly made me think of the 2016 book by Yuval Noah Harari Homo Deus in which the historian described how technology usually gets concentrated in the hands of the rich and powerful. It's just how economics works, no matter the political flavor. In this way, AI can move quickly beyond issues of personal safety, to those of economic security. In the X Space replay and the comments below it, I discuss the implications of \"post-labor economics\" as well as share more expert resources on these topics. Be sure to catch the replay of The Week in AI to hear my sense of the \"not-so-gentle\" transition we are headed into. 5) Apple WWDC: The Non-Event of the Week in AI For what to expect (or not) from Apple in AI innovation, I always turn to Robert Scoble on X @Scobleizer. Here were some of his summary posts... Cynical take on Apple's WWDC: just doing things Microsoft did back in 2003. Liquid glass. Menus on tablets. Dark take on it: it's way behind in AI, and didn't demonstrate any attempt to catch up. Light take: Lots of new AI features, like your phone will wait on hold for you now. Hopeful take: the new design joins Apple Vision Pro into its ecosystem, showing that the Apple Vision Pro is the future of Apple. Scoble adds: I really hate the recorded product demos and the old people showing new features and attempting to be \"hip.\" On a more Apple-positive note, Scoble is looking forward to the next devices which should be coming in the AR space... Later this year both Apple and Google are introducing heavyweight category wearables. Lighter than the first Vision Pro. We will judge them by who has the best AI inside. That is more important than resolution. Google, today, looks like it is way ahead and pulling further away because this is a game of exponents. I will buy both anyway. :-) (end of @Scobleizer rants) Many experts are sensing thatAlphabetis \"firing on all cylinders across AI\" as we've discussed previously. From Gemini 2.5 Pro and the astonishing new Veo 3 to building AI capabilities with their own with TPUs (instead of relying on NVIDIA GPUs), they're the only vertically-integrated player across all realms of tech. Google will probably also figure out the shift from classic search to generative search, as Daniel Newman of the Futurum technology research group says. Reports of Google's demise have been greatly exaggerated according to @DanielNewmanUV and I wish I was listening before I sold my shares on the last \"search is dead\" scare. 6) Zuck Splashes the Pot with $14.3 Billion Meta Platformsplunked down that amount for only 49% of a private company called Scale AI. But the price tag made it the biggest pure-AI acquisition, following OpenAI's $6 billion purchase of Jony Ive's company. Just like Sam wasn't waiting around to find out what AI-native device Apple will build, so too Zuck isn't waiting around for permission to have access to the premier company in the data supply chain -- what some are calling the oil refinery of the AI economy. What does that mean? Well if you think about data as various grades of crude oil, it needs to be cleaned and prepped in a number of ways before it can be \"mined and modeled\" for quality results. That's where Scale AI comes in with data prep and labeling because major AI models need structured and labeled training data to generate knowledge tokens, insights, and deep learning. Scale AI is a San Francisco-based artificial intelligence company founded in 2016 by Alexandr Wang and Lucy Guo. The company specializes in providing high-quality data labeling, annotation, and model evaluation services that are essential for training advanced AI models, including large language models (LLMs) and generative AI systems. Scale AI is known for its robust data engine, which powers AI development for leading tech firms, government agencies, and startups worldwide. Its research division, the Safety, Evaluation and Alignment Lab (SEAL), focuses on evaluating and aligning AI models for safety and reliability 7) AMD Unveils AI Server Rack, Sam on Stage with Lisa I am still shaking my head at all the stuff that happened last week! As if all of the above wasn't enough,Advanced Micro Devicesheld its annual Advancing AI conference last Thursday with a product roadmap for hyperscale inferencing that caught investor attention. In addition to leaps forward in performance for the existing Instinct MI350 Series GPU systems, AMD CEO Lisa Su unveiled the Helios AI Rack-scale architecture supporting up to 72 MI400 GPUs, with 432GB of HBM4 memory per GPU and 19.6 TB/sec bandwidth. Available in 2026, this is clearly an answer to NVIDIA's GB200/300 series rack systems. AI Market Growth: CEO Lisa Su projected an 80% increase in AI inference demand by 2026, driven by the rapid adoption and expansion of AI applications in enterprise and cloud environments. Roadmap: AMD reaffirmed its commitment to an annual cadence of AI chip releases, with the MI400 and MI450 series already in development and expected to challenge Nvidia\u2019s flagship offerings in 2026 and beyond. And then Sam Altman showed up during Lisa's keynote. Since he clearly can't get enough compute or GPUs, he's as tight with Lisa as he is with Jensen. Lisa welcomed the founder and CEO of OpenAI as a key design partner for AMD's upcoming MI450 GPU who will help shape the next generation of AMD's AI hardware. OpenAI will use AMD GPUs and Helios servers for advanced AI workloads, including ChatGPT. And AMD's other happy customers continue to come back for more with Meta deploying AMD Instinct MI300X GPUs for Llama 3/4 inference and collaborating on future MI350/MI400 platforms. Meanwhile Microsoft Azure runs proprietary and open-source models on AMD Instinct MI300X GPUs in production and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure will deploy zettascale AI clusters with up to 131,072 MI355X GPUs, offering massive AI compute capacity to customers. This event made AMD shares a clear buy last week -- and this week if you can still grab some under $130! Finally, did you hear what another OpenAI co-founder said at the University of Toronto commencement address? Ilya Sutskever, the OpenAI architect and deep learning pioneer who in 2024 started his own model firm, Safe Superintelligence, spoke these words to the new grads... \"The day will come when AI will do all the things we can do. The reason is the brain is a biological computer, so why can't the digital computer do the same things? \"It's funny that we are debating if AI can truly think or give the illusion of thinking, as if our biological brain is superior or fundamentally different from a digital brain.\" I had to dig out my old rant about the fundamental difference(s) between human brains and computer \"thinking.\" If you haven't heard me on this, you owe it to yourself so you can easily explain the differences to other \"intelligence experts\" telling you how consciousness works.

        "header": "Which AI Stocks Are Set to Soar in the Second Half?",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) stocks skyrocketed in 2024 amid excitement about this technology that could revolutionize businesses, saving time and money and leading to important discoveries. These players faced a few difficult months recently due to concerns about a potential economic slowdown. However, some of the uncertainty has passed, suggesting better days may be ahead for AI stocks. Against this backdrop,Nvidia(NVDA-1.14%),Apple(AAPL2.22%), andAmazon(AMZN-1.38%)are set to soar in the second half. Here's why. Image source: Getty Images. President Donald Trump's plan to imposetariffs on importsweighed on technology stocks, including AI chip giant Nvidia, several weeks ago. This pushed Nvidia down nearly 30% from the start of the year through early April. Though the president initially exempted electronics products, this exemption was temporary, suggesting chips and other items would face tariffs at some point in the near future. But Nvidia has since rebounded, thanks to optimism that tariffs won't be as steep as originally expected and as the company showed the strength of its earnings through the first quarter of the year. Nvidia's revenue surged 69% to $44 billion,\u00a0demand remained strong, andcustomer comments indicatethattheir spending plans for the year remain intact. This bodes well for ongoing growth for Nvidia. On top of this, the chip giant is making investments in U.S. manufacturing to limit any eventual tariff impact and sticks to its plan to update chips on an annual basis -- a move that should keep it ahead of rivals. Today, Nvidia trades for only 33 timesforward earnings estimates, down from about 50 times just a few months ago, and this level offers the stock plenty of room to run in the second half. Among all the top tech stocks, Apple may be the one that has suffered the most amid the recent tariff turbulence. Trump, displeased that Apple has generally produced most iPhones abroad, even threatened to impose a 25% tariff on Apple's imported iPhones. Meanwhile, Apple has made efforts to diversify its manufacturing, with a plan to move much of it from China to India. Uncertainty remains as the president wants Apple to bring iPhone production to the U.S., but doing this could result in a drastically higher price for the smartphone. All of this has hurt Apple stock, which is down about 20% since the start of the year. I view this as a buying opportunity because I don't think the U.S. aims to destroy Apple's growth. It's possible that both parties will reach a reasonable agreement. Meanwhile, any positive news on the subject could result in Apple stock bouncing back in the coming months. It's important to remember that Apple has built a very profitable smartphone empire with a tremendous moat, or competitive advantage, and these elements should support growth over the long term. All of this means that buying Apple now may result in gains in the coming months, but even better, set you up for a long-term win. Amazon's performance has been sluggish in recent times, with a 3% decline for the year, amid concerns that tariffs could hurt its e-commerce business andcloud computingunit, Amazon Web Services (AWS). But as mentioned above, the worst-case tariff scenario has been avoided, and the U.S. is making progress on trade agreements. So, I wouldn't expect to see a major impact from the tariffs on Amazon's growth. A key point is that Amazon has revamped its cost structure in recent years after facing pressure from rising inflation. This helped the company return to growth in just one year, and the efforts have positioned it well to maximize profit during future challenging times. So, these cost structure moves should help Amazon manage any potential tariff situation moving forward. And events such as Prime Day, which take place in the second half of the year, could help boost revenue. AWS has also been seeing tremendous growth from its AI efforts, which have helped it reach a $117 billion annual revenue run rate. We're still early in the AI story, so I would expect to see ongoing growth in this area, particularly since AWS is the world's No. 1 cloud service provider. Today, Amazon shares trade for 34 times forward earnings estimates, a reasonable level that could prompt investors to buy -- and help the stock take off in the second half.",

        "content": "Market participants are bracing for volatility this week after the U.S. launched attacks on three Iranian nuclear sites over the weekend. President Donald Trumpannounced Saturday eveningthat Iran's nuclear enrichment facilities had been \"obliterated\" by the strikes. While a full assessment of the damage was pending on Sunday, it's unclear how Iran might respond, whichcould lead investors to steer clear of risky assetssuch as stocks and cryptocurrencies. Oil prices, meanwhile, are expected to continue rising amid concerns that supplies could be disrupted if critical infrastructure is destroyed or shipping lanes are blocked. Meanwhile, after the Federal Reserveheld interest ratessteady\u00a0last week, Fed Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to explain the central bank\u2019s views on the economy to legislators when he delivers his periodic testimony to Congress this week.

ThePersonal Consumption Expenditures (PCE)for May should tell them more when it's released later in the week. Investors will also be watching for updates on first-quartergross domestic product (GDP), housing market data, and the latest developments in consumer confidence. Earnings from shoe retailer Nike\u00a0 (NKE), package delivery service FedEx (FDX), and chipmaker Micron Technology (MU) come as corporations continue to assess the impact that tariffs could have on their operations. And Tesla\u2019s anticipated rollout of its self-driving robotaxi is likely to be on investors' minds this week. Read to the bottom for our calendar of key events\u2014and one more thing. On the heels of last week\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting, Powell will testify before Congress to give lawmakers an update on the central bank\u2019s views on inflation and the economy. Powell is scheduled to testify before the House Financial Services Committee on Tuesday and the Senate Banking Committee on Wednesday. Several other Fed officials are also scheduled to deliver remarks during the week. The hearings could provide some market-moving moments, especially as political allies of President Donald Trump may take the opportunity to grill Powell.Trump has criticized Powellfor the central bank\u2019sreluctance to lower interest rates, a complaint that could be echoed by some lawmakers. Trump has pointed to lower inflation rates as a reason for the Fed to lower rates. Market watchers will get another look at inflation on Friday with the release of the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) report for May. PCE is important because it\u2019s the data the Fed looks at when gauging whether inflation is returning to its target rate of 2%. Inflation has been declining, with the PCE coming injust over the target ratein April. Athletic apparel giant Nike, a member of theDow 30, will lead corporate earnings this week with its scheduled update on Thursday. The struggling shoe maker warned during its prior quarterly report thattariffs could impact the company, coming as it reported declines in revenue and earnings. But analysts said the recent merger of Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) and Foot Locker (FL) could help Nike boost sales. FedEx scheduled earnings on Tuesday come as the shipping stalwart warned of lower revenue and profits during its prior quarterly report. Investors watch FedEx earnings because they can provide a view of shipping volumes, which in turn can offer insight into the overall health of the economy, and especially on global trade. Investors will also be watching Micron Technology\u2019s scheduled report on Wednesday, which comes after the chipmaker pledged a$200 billion investmentto boost semiconductor production in the U.S. Tesla (TSLA) is tentatively scheduled to roll out its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, on Sunday, June 22, though product updates have been delayed in the past. Expect Tesla\u2019s robotaxi to grab headlines and potentially move the EV maker\u2019s stock throughout the week, especially if Sunday\u2019s launch is delayed.

        "header": "Nvidia: How the chipmaker evolved from a gaming startup to an AI giant",
        "content": "Over the past two decades, Nvidia (NVDA) has skyrocketed into global conversation. The semiconductor company is considered an international leader in the design and manufacturing of computer chips and helped revolutionize the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). Beyond its strengths in the gaming, data, and AI fields, Nvidia announced plans this March for aquantum research center in Boston, where CEO Jensen Huang said researchers could tackle problems from drug discovery to materials development. Here\u2019s a look at Nvidia\u2019s path to where it is today, from creating hardware for the gaming industry to designing the chips that power AI. On April 5, 1993, Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky, and Curtis Priem founded Nvidia with an initial focus on designing and producing 3D graphics processors for computing and video games. The company\u2019s first product release, the multimedia processor NV1, didn\u2019t get the reception the founders were hoping for. What followed was a financial situation so dire that Nvidia laid off half its staff, leading to itsunofficial motto: \u201cOur company is 30 days from going out of business.\u201d In addition to the NV1\u2019s unimpressive return, a partnership that Nvidia had forged with Japanese video game company Sega to produce console graphics chips fell through, adding to the pressure. However, even as it pivoted to another company for chips, Segainvested $5 million in Nvidia\u2014 funding which allowed Nvidia to survive going out of business. Despite financial challenges and a smaller team, Nvidia released its next chip in 1997. It was a success. RIVA 128 allowed for support of high-resolution 2D and 3D graphics, and overa million unitswere sold in its first four months of sales. With the foundation of RIVA 128 sales, Nvidia produced RIVA TNT, which further cemented its place in the industry with better image quality and performance. Two years later, onJan. 22, 1999, Nvidia went public on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) at $12 a share, and by May, it shipped out its 10,000,000thgraphics processor. Later in 1999, Nvidia released GeForce 256, calling it the world\u2019s first \u201cGraphics Processing Unit.\u201d By marketing the chip directly to customers instead of just including it within a device or console, thecompany popularized the term \u201cGPU.\u201d With their ability to break larger tasks into smaller ones that could run at the same time, known as parallel processing, GPUs took on the heavy workload of powering graphics. It allowed devices to work on other processing functions faster, which meant GeForce 256 offered smoother, faster, and more realistic graphics. Finding growing success in supplying GPUs to both customers and consoles like Xbox, Nvidia joined theNasdaq 100 and the S&P 500in 2001. In 2006, Nvidialaunched CUDA, a platform that allowed users to access their GPUs\u2019 parallel processing capabilities to run their own software instead of just graphics. Between 2006 to 2017,Nvidia investednearly $12 billion in research & development with a large portion of those funds going towards CUDA. CUDA downloadsslowed entering the 2010s, and while CUDA provided users with the ability to use chips for purposes other than gaming, it didn\u2019t initially seem to pay off for investors. \u201cSome investors were big Nvidia fans in the late 2000s and gave them the benefit of the doubt for the first five years of the CUDA investment,\"Acquiredpodcast co-host Ben Gilbert said in a 2022 episode. \"But in the mid-2010s, market demand still wasn't showing up in a big way, and it was becoming a bigger and bigger investment.\" However, later technological developments would make CUDA crucial to the company. \"It made all of our products more expensive since we were selling these gamer cards while putting computing acceleration into them,\" Bryan Catanzaro, Nvidia's vice president of applied deep learning research, told Yahoo Financein 2023. \"It took a lot of commitment to follow through. \u2026 I would say it was about 10 years before Wall Street really started to believe this investment was worth anything.\" In 2012, students Alex Krizhevsky and Ilya Sutskever used CUDA to train the visual-recognition neural networkAlexNetwith two Nvidia GPUs. AlexNet\u2019s breakthrough performance in identifying images demonstrated that using GPUs to train machine learning models cut training times significantly compared to the CPUs that were previously used. Following this advancement, Nvidia began pivoting its focus to artificial intelligence, supported by its revenue from gaming. By 2016, it announced the DGX-1, a system designed specifically fordeep learningand the large language models that were on the rise. That year, Nvidia stock nearlytripledin price. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2018destiny meets serendipity,\u2019\u201d Nvidia CEO Jensen Huangtold Yahoo Financeat the time. \u201cPeople think it\u2019s an overnight success, but like most overnight successes, it took us years.\u201d At the same time, Nvidia took the opportunity to make strategic acquisitions, such as wireless companyIcerain 2011 and hardware companyThe Portland Groupin 2013. It tried to acquire the semiconductor and design company Arm (ARM) in 2020, but the deal ultimately fell through afterregulatory concerns. In March 2022, Nvidia announced the H100 \u201cHopper\u201d chip, promisingfaster training and better performancefor artificial intelligence. Controlling a significantmajority of the market sharewith this GPU, major companies, including Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), and Microsoft (MSFT), turned to Nvidia with billions as they began to develop AI and data-driven products. One such company is OpenAI (OPAI.PVT), whose relationship with Nvidia stretches back to 2016, when Nvidiadonated the first DGX-1 supercomputerto the startup. In November 2022, OpenAI launched ChatGPT, a language model built on Nvidia GPUs that quickly reached headlines. In less than two months, ChatGPT set the record for the fastest-growing consumer application in history, according toa UBS study,reaching 100 million monthly active users in January 2023. \"A new computing era has begun,\" Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang saidin a 2023 statement. \"Companies worldwide are transitioning from general-purpose to accelerated computing and generative AI.\" With investors increasingly interested in artificial intelligence and as the demand for GPUs to run models continues to grow, Nvidia\u2019s revenue for the quarter ending in January 2024more than doubledits results year over year. Following the quarterly report\u2019s release, Nvidia had thelargest one-day gainin stock market history, adding $277 billion in value. It then hit a valuation of $2 trillion the following day. The record wouldn\u2019t stand for long, however; Nvidia beat it again just two months later. That March, Nvidia announced its next chip: Blackwell. Offering higher performance withreduced cost and energy consumption, the chips were designed to work better than previous versions when linked to work together in large numbers. Soon after, Nvidia announced a10-for-1 stock splitin June 2024. Following the split, it passed Microsoft and Apple (AAPL) to become the world\u2019s most valuable company at $3.3 trillion. By November 2024, itwas addedto the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Despite its successes, Nvidia also encountered challenges throughout its rise. In 2018, it faced aclass-action lawsuitalleging it did not properly disclose to investors the impact of the cryptocurrency market on revenue from sales of GPUs. At the time, \u201cminers\u201d of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin (BTC-USD) and ethereum (ETH-USD) used the GPUs to complete transactions and secure new crypto tokens. The process requires significant computational power, which made Nvidia GPUs a popular choice. Nvidia paid a$5.5 million settlementin 2022 to the SEC because of the issue, and in December 2024, the Supreme Court dismissed Nvidia\u2019s appeal, allowingthe 2018 case to proceed. This wasn\u2019t Nvidia\u2019s first time managing legal issues regarding its chips. In 2016, it settled a case involving the marketed performance and actual capabilities of itsGTX 970, with payouts of $30 per purchase. On top of legal issues, there is also the challenge of supply keeping up with demand. Aglobal chip shortagefirst occurred in early 2020 as a result of the coronavirus pandemic and an increased reliance on technology for remote work. Other factors that lengthened the shortage through 2023 included the initial US-China trade war, severe weather events, and the Russia-Ukraine war. ADecember 2024 reportfrom the IDC projected global demand for AI and high-performance computing (HPC) to grow by over 15% in 2025. President Trump announcedProject Stargatein January 2025, which involves tech companies such as Oracle (ORCL), OpenAI, and SoftBank (SFTBY) investing $500 billion in AI infrastructure in the United States over the next four years. Nvidia, as a technology partner to the project, saw a jump in its stock, and reached a$3.6 trillion market cap. Later in the month, however, the Chinese company DeepSeek released its own AI model, which was reportedly trained at asignificantly lower costthan that of competitors. Following the announcement, Nvidia stock dropped $589 billion, almost 17%, marking thelargest single-day lossin stock market history. Following the drop, March 2025 brought the debut of Nvidia's Blackwell Ultra, the successor to Blackwell. The new chip was announced to have1.5 timesthe performance of the previous chip, which could help AI models answer queries faster. In April 2025, Trumpbanned the exportof the company\u2019s H20 chip to China, as chips like Nvidia\u2019s are critical in the race to develop AI technologies. In its first quarter report, Nvidia said it expects to miss$8 billionin potential sales because of the ban. Despite the expanded limitations on exports, Nvidia continues to grow and even briefly passed Microsoft again in June as the world\u2019s most valuable company. Looking forward, some even expect it could bethe first company to hit a $4 trillionmarket cap. \u201c[Nvidia] really got the AI revolution going,\u201d ARK Invest founder Cathie Wood told Yahoo Financeearlier this year, \u201cand we think it's still going to play a mighty role.\" Click here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance \u2014 Nina is a data reporter intern for Yahoo Finance.",

        "header": "3 Best Tech Stocks for the Second Half of 2025",
        "content": "We're nearly halfway through 2025, and what a ride it's been for the stock market. As of this writing, theS&P 500,Nasdaq Composite, andDow Jones Industrial Indexare up 2%, up 1%, and down 1%, respectively, year to date. So, as attention turns to the second half of 2025, three Fool.com contributing analysts have selected their top buys within the technology sector:Reddit(RDDT-1.13%),Advanced Micro Devices(AMD1.12%), andMeta Platforms(META-1.88%). Here's why. Image source: Getty Images. Jake Lerch(Reddit):2025 has been an up-and-down year for Reddit stock. As of this writing, it's down 13% year to date. However, the stock has been extremely volatile throughout the year. It's been up as much as 37% and down by almost 46%. So, obviously, Reddit isn't a stock for every investor orinvestment portfolio. That said, growth-oriented investors willing to hold for years might want to take the stock's recentvolatilityas an opportunity to accumulate shares. Reddit is asocial media stock. It boasts more than 108 million daily average users and is growing fast. As of its most recent quarterly report (for the three months ended on March 31),the company'srevenue growth stood at 61%. The company makes money through selling ad space, like its much larger social media rival,Meta Platforms. While Meta's ad ecosystem has existed formore thana decade and now draws in about a half-billion dollars per day, Reddit's ad ecosystem remains in its infancy. This creates a possibility for investors. Meta has already proven that the social media advertising model works -- and works very well. Meta has ridden that model to a staggering market capitalization of $1.7 trillion.Reddit,on the other hand, has a market cap of only $26 billion. In a move that mirrors Meta, Reddit recently announced plans to integrate artificial intelligence (AI)-powered ad tools into its network. This strategy could help marketers increase return on investment (ROI) by improving ad targeting and content. With its large, increasing user base and blistering revenue growth, there's every reason to think Reddit's long-term prospects remain bright -- and its stock price will rise. Will Healy(Advanced Micro Devices):On the surface, Advanced Micro Devices might look more like a second-quarterthan a second-half stock. Since reaching an intra-day low of $76.48 per share on April 8, the stock has risen by approximately 65% over the last six weeks. However, that increase could be just the beginning of what is gearing up to be a second-half comeback. On June 12, AMD released its development pipeline for its AI accelerators through 2027. Investor interest coalesced around its MI400 GPU, which it plans to release sometime in 2026. The MI400 should significantly improve upon the recently released MI350, offering double the compute power, 50% more memory capacity, and 2.5 times the bandwidth. Such advancements are on track to close most of its competitive gap withNvidia, though Nvidia will almost certainly counter with its own improvements. Additionally, AMD will integrate the MI400 with its Helios rack system. This rack system will combine the MI400 with AMD's upcoming Venice CPU and Pensando Vulcano NICs, providing AMD with a unified AI rack-scale infrastructure for modeling and inference. This is occurring as AMD has begun to benefit from accelerating revenue growth. In the first quarter of 2025, itsdata centerand client (PC) segments grew revenue by 57% and 68%, respectively, whilerevenuefor the gaming and embedded segments declined at a slower rate. Thus, the overall annual revenue growth of 36% in Q1 is significantly faster than the 14% yearly increase in 2024. Moreover, while AMD trades at a higher P/E ratio than Nvidia, improving profitability places its forward P/E ratio at 32, slightly below that of its larger rival. Furthermore, AMD's 7.5 price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is far below Nvidia's sales multiple of 24, likely making the stock more attractive to value-oriented investors. Admittedly, AMD continues to play catch-up in the AI accelerator market. Nonetheless, with the chip company closing the gap, that low P/S ratio could easily persuade investors to bid AMD stock higher as they anticipate the MI400's release. Justin Pope(Meta Platforms):Oftentimes, winners keep winning. Shares of social media giant Meta Platforms have primarily moved in an upward direction since 2023, but I like the stock's chances to continue its run over the second half of this year. Most investors already know that Meta Platforms is a beast in digital advertising. It makes virtually all of its revenue and profits from advertising to the 3.43 billion people who use its family of apps each day. What investors may not realize is that for years, Facebook and Instagram have carried the company's advertising water. Meta generated approximately $160.6 billion of its $164.5 billion in total revenue last year from ads placed in Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and third-party mobile apps. Missing from that list is WhatsApp, the wildly popular communications app with over 3 billion monthly active users. But that's changing. Meta recently announced that it will finally place ads in WhatsApp statuses and channel pages. That will open up an entirely new revenue stream for the company, which, given the massive ad revenue Facebook and Instagram produce, could drive significant growth as monetization ramps up over time. Analysts anticipate that Meta's earnings will grow at an average annual rate of 18% over the next three to five years. I wouldn't be surprised if WhatsApp's incremental ad revenue helps the company meet or exceed those estimates. Meta's price-to-earnings ratio has risen to 27, but, frankly, that's still reasonable for the growth you're likely to see over the coming years. Meta waited over a decade after acquiring WhatsApp to make this move, demonstrating just how well its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, can play the long game. Investors would probably be wise to consider partnering with Meta as buy-and-hold investors at these prices.",

        "content": "If you had invested $1,000 inAmazonstock 10 years ago, that investment position would now be worth nearly $10,000. Meanwhile, a $1,000 investment inNvidiaa decade ago would now be worth more than $265,000. While investing in stocks typically comes with a much higher level of risk compared to bonds and other fixed-income investments, the potential for explosive returns is also much higher. With that in mind, read on to see why two Motley Fool contributors identified these two companies as top investment candidates to put $1,000 into right now. Image source: Getty Images. Keith Noonan(Micron Technology):Artificial intelligence (AI) is taking the world by storm, and it seems virtually certain that its transformative impacts are still in the very stages of unfolding. Along with software advances from a wide variety of players, it's likely that high-powered hardware from a smaller group of providers will continue to play a central role in pushing the technology forward. Nvidia will likely continue to lead the high end of the graphics processing unit (GPU) technologies that help power advanced training and inference applications for AI, but it also looks likeAdvanced Micro Devicescould be making some significant inroads in the space. While both of these processing specialists could be worth betting on, I think that investors should also take a close look at one of the key components providers for their most advanced hardware --Micron Technology(MU1.43%). Micron is a designer and manufacturer of memory chips and storage solutions that's playing an important role in the AI revolution. While the company's business has historically revolved mostly around the consumer market, that's changed rapidly -- and memory chips used in GPUs, accelerators, and other hardware for data centers are now central to its growth story. The company's high-bandwidth memory (HBM) solutions are used by both Nvidia and AMD for advanced AI processors, and the demand outlook for these technologies is very promising. In addition to being a pick-and-shovel play that should allow investors to benefit from rising demand for GPUs from Nvidia, AMD, and other players in the AI processors space, Micron could be poised to benefit from geopolitical trends. Due to rising tensions between the U.S. and China, leading domestic tech companies will likely be less inclined to rely on memory chips and storage solutions from Chinese providers. In response, Micron is moving to dramatically ramp up chip fabrication and design capabilities in the U.S. With rising AI-related demand and geopolitical dynamics potentially taking some of the companies biggest competitors out of the equation, Micron stock looks like a strong investment right now. Jennifer Saibil(MercadoLibre):If you could go back in time and invest $1,000 in Amazon when it was just getting started, would you? I can't imagine there's an investor out there who wouldn't answer, \"Yes.\" Although that may be theoretical, you have a similar opportunity if you invest inMercadoLibre(MELI0.03%)stock today. MercadoLibre is an e-commerce powerhouse that only operates in Latin America. But it's the leader in its region, and it has incredible momentum, reporting high growth and profits, and it has massive long-term opportunities. It's actually been around about as long as Amazon, but because it has a smaller market that's still underdeveloped, it has a long growth runway. Management says that e-commerce penetration in its regions lags the U.S. by about a decade at about 13% in its markets, while it's about 24% in the U.S. and 32% in China. In the 2025 first quarter, gross merchandise volume increased 40% year over year (currency neutral). MercadoLibre is enjoying several growth drivers. It's attracting new users, and unique active visitors increased 25% year over year in the quarter. It's upgrading its logistics network to get orders to shoppers faster, and it's focusing on the grocery area, which has a high repeat purchase rate and increased 65% in the quarter. Engagement is increasing as more shoppers buy across more categories, and average purchase frequency is on the rise as well. The company is also developing aformidable fintech businessthat was created to help its underbanked customers pay for e-commerce purchases. What began as a digital wallet that could be filled by paying cash in stores throughout its markets has become a full financial services app, including credit cards and investing tools. It's also aiming to open a complete digital bank in Mexico as a pilot. Fintech services are also growing at a rapid pace. Monthly active users increased 31% year over year in the first quarter to 64 million, and total payment volume (TPV) increased 72% over last year. Assets under management more than doubled in the first quarter, and the credit portfolio increased 75%. In Brazil, one of its biggest markets, the traditional banking industry is already being disrupted, with incumbent banks' TPV on the decline, while challenger banks increase their TPV. This is a model that can be replicated in its other countries of operation as well. Management is investing in other growth areas, too, such as digital advertising and ad-supported streaming as an innovative method to increase its brand presence. MercadoLibre is beating the market this year, up 39%, as investors are prizing its protection against U.S. tariffs. But investors should buy it for its huge long-term opportunity.",

        "header": "2 Top Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Buy in June",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) investing is still a major theme in the market. Although some AI hyperscalers have had success rolling out AI models, they aren't making a ton of money from it yet. As a result, I think investors are better off buying shares of the companies benefiting from this spending. This makes shares of companies likeNvidia(NVDA-1.14%)andTaiwan Semiconductor(TSM-1.76%)excellent investments right now, and I think they are top AI stocks to buy with a little bit of June remaining. Image source: Getty Images. There's an old saying: History doesn't repeat itself, but it often rhymes. Applying this wisdom to the AI arms race makes it easy to see a parallel: the gold rush. During the gold rush, only a few prospectors struck gold and got rich, while many of them lost everything. On the flip side, those who sold pickaxes and shovels to the prospectors made a ton of money. That gives rise to the investment description of \"picks and shovels,\" which perfectly describes Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor. Nvidia makesgraphics processing units (GPUs)that excel at processing workloads requiring immense computing power. A GPU is different from a traditional CPU because it can process multiple calculations in parallel. Combining this attribute with the ability to connect thousands of GPUs together in clusters allows AI hyperscalers to create jaw-dropping computing capacity used to train and run AI models. Nvidia has an iron grip on the data center market, with most estimates stating that Nvidia has a 90% or greater market share in the data center GPU space. This dominance has allowed Nvidia's stock to prosper, as its revenue has dramatically risen since the start of 2023.  NVDA Revenue (TTM)data byYCharts Nvidia is far from done growing. It posted 69% revenue growth in Q1 and projects 50% in Q2. With Nvidia's clients announcing record data center spending for this year, it's no surprise that there's a ton of upside left. As a result, I think it's still one of the best AI stocks to own moving forward. Nvidia doesn't make the chips that go into its GPUs; that's done by Taiwan Semiconductor. Alongside Nvidia, Taiwan Semi also has several other notable names in the AI arms race as clients, as well as consumer electronics customers likeApple. If you've got a device that would be considered advanced technology, chances are there's a chip produced by Taiwan Semiconductor inside of it. Taiwan Semi is also expanding from its home base in Taiwan to the U.S., Japan, and Germany, reducing the single point of failure risk by having all manufacturing based in Taiwan. Taiwan is always at risk of war with mainland China, which could disrupt the global economy should action occur. However, a takeover would likely trigger the rest of the stock market to sell off heavily. As a result, I think investors overstate the risk of investing in a Taiwan-based company. There's a ton to like about TSMC as an investment, but its growth is near the top. Management projects that Taiwan Semi's AI-related revenue will increase at a 45% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next five years, with total revenue increasing at nearly a 20% CAGR. That's market-crushing growth, but the stock trades at nearly the same multiple as the broader market, as measured by theS&P 500(^GSPC-0.22%).  TSM PE Ratio (Forward)data byYCharts At 22.8times forward earnings, its valuation is almost the same as the S&P 500's 22.9 times forward earnings. This reasonable valuation, combined with above-average growth, makes Taiwan Semiconductor a no-brainer buy today. Investors can confidently take a position here andexpect solid returns over the next five years.",

        "header": "Which 3 Tech Giants Could Cross the $3 Trillion Mark Next?",
        "content": "While not all have stayed there, there have been three tech giants that have crossed the $3 trillionmarket capthreshold:Microsoft,Nvidia, andApple. The more compelling question now is: which companies are best positioned to be the next to join the $3 trillion club? In my view, the most likely candidates areAmazon(AMZN-1.38%),Alphabet(GOOGL-3.89%)(GOOG-3.68%), andMeta Platforms(META-1.88%). Let's take a closer look at these three stocks and see what it will take for them to get there. Image source: Getty Images With nearly a $2.3 trillion market cap, Amazon is the closest company to join the $3 trillion club. It would need to see its stock price rise by about 33% to reach this exclusive club. The probability of this happening in the next few years looks promising. The company is the market leader in two important fields:cloud computingand e-commerce. Its cloud computing unit, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is its largest business by profitability. It's also its fastest-growing segment, with revenue jumping 17% last quarter. AWS is benefiting from the trend inartificial intelligence (AI)in two main ways. One is that customers are flocking to use its services, such as Bedrock and Sagemaker, to help customize, build, and deploy AI models and apps. They are then running them on its data center infrastructure, leading to a nice recurring revenue stream. Amazon has also developed its own custom AI chips through an in-house subsidiary, which helps give it a cost advantage. With the company investing heavily in AI infrastructure to keep up with demand, this is a nice advantage. Amazon's e-commerce business, meanwhile, is a solid high single-digit to low double-digit revenue grower. However, the company is using AI to help make both its logistics and warehouse operations more efficient, which is leading to lower costs and increased profitability in this segment. It is also using AI to help power its high-margin sponsored ad business, which has become the fastest-growing part of its e-commerce segment. With Amazon's stock trading at one of the more attractive valuations in its history, the path to hitting $3 trillion over the next few years looks pretty clear, barring a big recession. Not trailing far behind Amazon in market cap is Alphabet at just over $2.1 trillion. To reach $3 trillion, the stock would have to rise a little more than 42% from current levels. While I think the likelihood of this happening in the next few years is high, the company admittedly has some obstacles as well. The biggest hurdle to Alphabet reaching a $3 trillion market cap would be if the company faced harsh penalties from its antitrust trial, such as having to sell off its Chrome browser or Android smartphone operating systems or even being forced to break up. However, it does appear that U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta is leaning more toward lighter penalties, given the rise of AI competition. Therein lies the other risk for Alphabet, with new competition coming from AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Grok, as well as AI-powered search engines from companies like PerplexityAI. Investors are worried about the impact that AI will have on Google's search dominance, and there is certainly a shift occurring. However, Google does have a couple of nice advantages. First, it has strong distribution through Chrome and Android, as well as deals to be the default search engine on Apple devices and other browsers. Second, Alphabet has spent decades building one of the most expansive ad networks on the planet, which allows it to serve both major brands and small local businesses. Meanwhile, the company is no slouch in AI. Its Gemini model has received strong benchmark scores, and it's been focusing on AI features that will help with monetization, such as virtual outfit try-ons and agentic AI-powered checkout. While many AI start-ups will be struggling to scale and turn a profit, Alphabet is well positioned to turn its AI investments into earnings much sooner. Throw in Alphabet's fast-growing cloud computing business, its emerging Waymo robotaxi business, and leading YouTube streaming platform to go along with one of the cheapest valuations in the mega-cap tech space, and the company has a solid path to joining the $3 trillion market cap club. With a market cap of just under $1.8 trillion, Meta Platforms has the most work to do to get to a $3 trillion market cap. The stock would have to climb about 72% from current levels to join the exclusive club. However, I would not count it out. Meta Platforms was the fastest-growing of the the three companies last quarter, with its revenue jumping 16%. AI is helping power its results, with the company seeing increased user engagement and better ad performance being driven by its proprietary Llama AI model. This, in turn, is leading to more ad inventory and higher prices. Last quarter, ad impressions rose 5%, while ad prices jumped 10%. However, what can really drive Meta's stock forward to that $3 trillion market is new monetization opportunities. Just this month, the company announced it will begin to serve ads on its popular WhatsApp messaging platform. With more than 3 billion monthly users, including more than 100 million in the U.S., these new ads represent a huge opportunity. The ads will appear in the status section of the messaging app and will be visible through the updates tab. In addition, the company is in the midst of building out another social media platform called Threads. The platform is growing quickly and has more than 350 million active monthly users, as last reported. It has also just started to gradually serve ads on Threads, as well. Between more ad inventory, higher ad prices due to improved effectiveness, and Meta just beginning to serve ads on two platforms it hasn't served ads on before, the company has the opportunity to reach the $3 trillion mark in the next few years.",

        "header": "10 Reasons to Buy and Hold This Semiconductor Stock Forever",
        "content": "Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(TSM-1.76%)is one of the most valuable companies in the world at a market cap of $1.1 trillion, but it doesn't get the same level of attention that other big tech stocks get likeNvidiaorMicrosoftdo. Still, TSMC's competitive advantages can go toe to toe with any other stock, whether it's in the \"Magnificent Seven\" or not. On that note, let's take a look at 10 reasons to buy and hold this stock forever. Image source: Getty Images. TSMC is the clear leader in semiconductor manufacturing with roughly 67% market share, and an even higher share of advanced chips, estimated at roughly 90%. With that level of market share, TSMC has pricing power, and its customers have limited alternatives. The company has gained that market share over time, and it's unlikely to erode anytime soon. TSMC is in a great competitive position not just because of its dominant market share, but it's also benefiting from tremendous in its industry due to the growth of artificial intelligence (AI) and technology more broadly. That's a major reason why revenue jumped 42% in the first quarter, and future innovations should continue to drive chip demand. TSMC dominates the chip foundry industry in part because it was the first company to employ the third-party foundry model when it was founded in 1987. Over the years, that model has prevailed over the traditional integrated model. TSMC's collection of customers helps show why the company is so dominant. Among its top customers areApple, Nvidia,AMD, andBroadcom, cutting-edge chip-design companies and some of the most innovative companies in technology. Profit margin is one of the clearest indicators ofcompetitive advantage, and TSMC shines in that category. In the first quarter, the company reported an operating margin of 49%, showing it has pricing power and economies of scale. TSMC is not only a dominant company in its own right, but its services are in such high demand as semiconductors are crucial for the global economy. As part of the CHIPS Act, TSMC is receiving $6.6 billion in subsidies, and it's received $2 billion from the Chinese and Japanese governments in recent years. Considering its growth rate and competitive advantage, TSMC has been historically undervalued, and that seems to be the case today as it trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 25, on par with theS&P 500. TSMC dominates the market for advanced chips, which it considers to be 7 nanometers (nm) or under. Those chips made up 73% of the company's revenue in the first quarter, and chips for high-performance computing, much of which is used for AI. The next two largest semiconductor manufacturers are Samsung andInteland both of those companies have faltered of late. Samsung recently apologized to investors for not innovating enough and its poor performance. Intel, meanwhile, is in the midst of a yearslong crisis. Its stock price has tumbled as the company is struggling to grow and deliver a profit. TSMC has outperformed the S&P 500 over virtually any time frame in its history. Over the last five years, the stock is up nearly 300% and 800% over the last decade. Past performance doesn't guarantee future returns in the stock market, but winners tend to keep winning, and TSMC looks poised to do that.",

        "content": "The Federal Reserveheld interest ratessteady\u00a0last week. Now, Fed Chair Jerome Powell will explain the central bank\u2019s views on the economy to legislators when he delivers his regularly scheduled testimony to Congress this week. Central bankers have stood pat as they are concerned inflation will reignite in the wake of tariffs. ThePersonal Consumption Expenditures (PCE)for May should tell them more when it's released later in the week. Investors will also be watching for updates on first-quartergross domestic product (GDP), housing market data, and the latest developments in consumer confidence. Earnings from shoe retailer Nike\u00a0 (NKE), package delivery service FedEx (FDX), and chipmaker Micron Technology (MU) come as corporations continue to assess the impact that tariffs could have on their operations. And Tesla\u2019s anticipated rollout of its self-driving robotaxi is likely to be on investors' minds this week. Read to the bottom for our calendar of key events\u2014and one more thing. On the heels of last week\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting, Powell will testify before Congress to give lawmakers an update on the central bank\u2019s views on inflation and the economy. Powell is scheduled to testify before the House Financial Services Committee on Tuesday and the Senate Banking Committee on Wednesday. Several other Fed officials are also scheduled to deliver remarks during the week. The hearings could provide some market-moving moments, especially as political allies of President Donald Trump may take the opportunity to grill Powell.Trump has criticized Powellfor the central bank\u2019sreluctance to lower interest rates, a complaint that could be echoed by some lawmakers. Trump has pointed to lower inflation rates as a reason for the Fed to lower rates. Market watchers will get another look at inflation on Friday with the release of the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) report for May. PCE is important because it\u2019s the data the Fed looks at when gauging whether inflation is returning to its target rate of 2%. Inflation has been declining, with the PCE coming injust over the target ratein April. Athletic apparel giant Nike, a member of theDow 30, will lead corporate earnings this week with its scheduled update on Thursday. The struggling shoe maker warned during its prior quarterly report thattariffs could impact the company, coming as it reported declines in revenue and earnings. But analysts said the recent merger of Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) and Foot Locker (FL) could help Nike boost sales. FedEx scheduled earnings on Tuesday come as the shipping stalwart warned of lower revenue and profits during its prior quarterly report. Investors watch FedEx earnings because they can provide a view of shipping volumes, which in turn can offer insight into the overall health of the economy, and especially on global trade. Investors will also be watching Micron Technology\u2019s scheduled report on Wednesday, which comes after the chipmaker pledged a$200 billion investmentto boost semiconductor production in the U.S. Tesla (TSLA) is tentatively scheduled to roll out its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, on Sunday, June 22, though product updates have been delayed in the past. Expect Tesla\u2019s robotaxi to grab headlines and potentially move the EV maker\u2019s stock throughout the week, especially if Sunday\u2019s launch is delayed.

        "content": "With the US striking Iranian nuclear sites, there is a concern that a spreading conflict could ... More impact oil supply and thus choke global economic growth. This piece examines the impact of past geopolitical events on markets and the potential US economic implications of the Israel-Iran conflict. Vector illustrationgetty Beyond the obvious humanitarian tragedy that surrounds any armed conflict, the Israel-Iran war has crucial possible implications for the global economy. With the U.S. striking Iranian nuclear sites, there is a concern that a spreading conflict could impact oil supply and thus choke global economic growth. This piece will examine the impact of past geopolitical events on markets and the potential implications of the Israel-Iran conflict.   Past Geopolitical Events When Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990, there were some similar concerns to today. The S&P 500 was down 3.3% in the week following and took months to recover. By the following year, stocks were over 10% higher. The backdrop was quite different from today, though, with the U.S. in the midst of a recession and the Savings & Loan crisis.  To be clear, even though they are luckily in the minority, there are events like World War II or September 11, where markets are significantly lower a year after the initiation of hostilities. Stock Performance After 29 Major Geopolitical EventsGlenview Trust, Bloomberg  Recent Market Performance Since the start of the current Israel-Iran hostilities on June 13, the S&P 500 has been 1.2% lower.  Stocks were little changed last week. The S&P 500 is 2.9% below its mid-February high, having declined by almost 20%. The Magnificent 7, comprising Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has recovered to 8.7% below its mid-December level.Market ReturnsGlenview Trust, Bloomberg  MORE FOR YOU Oil Prices Since the war began on June 12, the price of WTI crude oil has increased by 10.1%. Since energy, with oil being a significant part of that mix, is a key fuel for all economic growth, past spikes in oil prices have been associated with economic downturns. On the surface, the increase in prices does not seem extreme enough to collapse economic activity. The price remains well below the 2022 spike on both a nominal and, more importantly, inflation-adjusted basis. Oil PricesGlenview Trust, Bloomberg Consumer Impact Notably, the U.S. and the world have become much more efficient in the utilization of energy. This improved efficiency has translated into a lower proportion of consumer spending allocated to energy, even at the same oil price. In other words, consumers are less negatively affected by oil price increases than in the past.Percent Of Total Spending On EnergyGlenview Trust, Bloomberg To be clear, higher oil prices are still felt by the consumer. One need only think back to the adverse reaction to high gasoline prices in 2022 to prove the point. Furthermore, like tariffs, the higher oil and gasoline prices weigh more heavily on lower-income households than on higher-income households, as they spend a larger percentage of their income on energy.US Retail Gasoline PricesGlenview Trust, Bloomberg U.S. Oil Production Fracking changed the story of U.S. oil production more than many appreciate. U.S. domestic oil production began to decline in the 1970s and reached its lowest point in 2008. Since then, fracking has led to production surging to all-time highs.US Domestic Crude Oil ProductionGlenview Trust, Bloomberg The U.S. has now become the Saudi Arabia of oil. While Saudi Arabia\u2019s share of the global crude oil production has remained reasonably constant at around 12%, the U.S. has increased from providing about 8% of the global oil supply to over 20%.Share Of Global Crude Oil ProductionGlenview Trust, Bloomberg U.S. Economic Impact In the past, the automatic answer was that the U.S. economy suffered a net loss when oil prices were higher. Consider that without significant domestic production, the U.S. economy was primarily seeing higher prices without benefiting from the oil price increase. With the surge in U.S. production, the increase in oil prices is likely to be neutral for the U.S. economy. This less U.S. economic harm isn\u2019t to imply that a spike in oil prices would be an optimal situation for the economy or markets. Consider higher oil prices as a general reallocation of profits from other industries to the energy sector. This profit reallocation is not typically healthy for overall stock market performance.Economic Impact Of US Oil ProductionGlenview Trust, Bloomberg U.S. Households The recent release of U.S. household net worth presents a relatively optimistic picture in aggregate, with net worth only slightly below all-time highs.US Household Net Worth: 1Q 2025Glenview Trust, Bloomberg While it is correct for pessimists to point to rising U.S. consumer debt levels since the pandemic lows, the ability of households to handle that debt remains at better-than-pre-pandemic levels.US Household Debt LevelsGlenview Trust, Bloomberg Further to rising consumer debt, credit card debt has also increased, but delinquencies remain below pre-pandemic levels.Credit Card DelinquenciesGlenview Trust, Bloomberg Overall, U.S. households are in a reasonable financial position to withstand an increase in oil prices. Much of the positive story relies on the U.S. labor market remaining resilient. There are signs, as indicated by slowing payroll job growth and rising continuing claims for unemployment benefits, that the job situation is deteriorating. As noted previously, a rise in oil prices disproportionately negatively impacts lower-income households, who are already struggling with the elevated inflation of recent years. Federal Reserve As expected, the Federal Reserve made no change to short-term interest rates last week. The meeting continued the trend of the central bank holding steady under \u201celevated\u201d uncertainty about the economic outlook. The updated median estimates from the Fed still call for two rate cuts this year. Under the surface, the forecast showed a considerable difference in opinions among members, with seven expecting no cuts in 2025 and ten forecasting two or more cuts. To underscore the lack of confidence in the outlooks, Chair Powell said, \u201cNo one holds these rate paths with a great deal of conviction.\u201d Markets currently expect two 0.25% Fed cuts in 2025, consistent with the median Fed projection. There is little chance of a cut in July. Instead, the first move lower in 2025 is expected in September.Number Of Expected Fed Rate CutsGlenview Trust, Bloomberg Betting Odds The betting market priced in slightly higher odds of a recession in 2025 following the beginning of the bombing of Iran. This relatively small increase in recession risk is consistent with the decline in stock prices. Notably, markets currently project a relatively low risk of a U.S. recession, which is consistent with the fundamental health of the U.S. economy and its current resilience to higher oil prices.Betting Odds Of 2025 US RecessionGlenview Trust, Bloomberg Conclusions The primary economic risk of the Israel-Iran conflict is the potential threat to oil supplies, which could lead to significantly higher oil prices. Higher oil prices are a headwind to global growth. While higher oil prices are a significant drag on many sectors within the U.S. economy, the profits from U.S. oil production provide a positive offset. Within industries, high energy prices reallocate profits from other sectors to the energy sector. Stocks within the energy sector tend to outperform when oil prices rise and underperform when they fall.S&P 500 Energy Sector Relative PerformanceGlenview Trust, Bloomberg Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway has a significant allocation to energy stocks, which account for approximately 11% of the publicly traded stock portfolio, compared to a little over 3% of the S&P 500. Berkshire controls almost 27% of the outstanding shares in Occidental Petroleum (OXY), which, combined with its Chevron (CVX) position, results in a significant overweight in the energy sector. A deeper analysis of the probable reasons behind the Occidental purchase can be found here. Buffett has noted that energy investments are a bet on oil prices over the long term. Based on past geopolitical conflicts, investors should be prepared for pressure on stocks at the start of any widening conflict. While the timing is always unclear, stocks have rebounded as the uncertainty surrounding the events waned. If energy stocks aren\u2019t already part of their diversified portfolio, investors should consider allocating some portion of their portfolio to energy stocks. The energy sector is expected to benefit from rising oil prices, providing some offset to the pressure on other industries. Disclosure: Glenview Trust may hold stocks mentioned in this article within its recommended investment strategies.Editorial StandardsReprints & Permissions",

        "content": "Micron Technology (MU) is slated to report fiscal third-quarter earnings after the bell Wednesday, with analysts expecting the memory chip maker's profits to more than double from a year ago. Analysts on average expect Micron to report revenue of $8.86 billion, up 30% year-over-year. It's projected to post adjusted net income of $1.86 billion, or $1.61 per share, up from $702 million, or $0.62 per share, a year earlier. In March, the Nvidia (NVDA) partner posted quarterly revenue thattopped analysts' expectations, thanks in part to data center sales tripling on growing AI demand. Of the 11 analysts covering Micron tracked by Visible Alpha, nine have a \u201cbuy\u201d rating for the stock, alongside two \u201chold\u201d ratings, though their consensus price target near $121 would suggest a slight decline from Friday\u2019s close at $123.60. Shares of Micron have been on a tear in recent weeks, and have added nearly half of their value in 2025 so far. The results also come after Micron earlier this month announced plans toboost its U.S. investmentsto about $150 billion in memory manufacturing and $50 billion in research and development.\u00a0The chipmaker said most of the money would be used for \"two leading-edge high-volume fabs in Idaho, up to four leading-edge high-volume fabs in New York, the expansion and modernization of its existing manufacturing fab in Virginia,\" and advanced its high-bandwith memory packaging capabilities.",

        "header": "10 Brilliant Growth Stocks to Buy Now and Hold for the Long Term",
        "content": "Not all of the growth stocks featured here will likely deliver outsize returns, so it makes sense to spread portfolio risk around a collection of holdings. In that line of thought, here are 10 growth stock ideas for investors to consider. They range from a couple of high-profile household names, such asTesla(TSLA-0.09%)andDelta Air Lines(DAL-0.66%), to companies likeNavitas Semiconductor(NVTS0.14%)andSynopsys(SNPS-0.65%), which are less well known. You might want to consider buying and holding any (or all) of these equities long-term. Image source: Getty Images. The key tothe investment casefor Tesla lies in its promised robotaxis and unsupervised full self-driving (FSD) software, which is scheduled to launch on a limited basis beginning this week. Tesla is already a highly successful automaker and the dominant player in electric vehicles (EVs) in the U.S., and robotaxis offer the prospect of transforming it into a company able to generate high-margin and recurring revenue from owning its robotaxi fleet or revenue sharing from Tesla's transformed fleet using Full Self-Driving (FSD) software. There's also the dedicated robotaxi, Cybercab, and the potential to sell FSD on a subscription basis. And all of it will be supported by Tesla's market-leading position in EVs and its ability to develop affordable EVs in the future. Nvidiapartners Navitas Semiconductor andVertiv(VRT-0.45%)and the next generation of data centers, namely 800-volt (V) high voltage direct current (HVDC), which I've discussedin more detail elsewhere, so investors with the time and inclination can peruse. Nvidia believes they will be more efficient, with lower maintenance costs and significantly lower costs of ownership. The new data centers, scheduled for 2027, employ a different power conversion method, and Navitas is developing Gallium Nitride (GaN) and Silicon Carbide (SiC) power semiconductors to enable more efficient power conversion in 800V HVDC data centers. Similarly, another Nvidia partner, and leading data center equipment provider, Vertiv, is developing critical power and cooling equipment and systems for the new data centers and expects to have them available in the second half of 2026, in time for the launch of the 800V HVDC data center in 2027. What makes both companies particularly interesting is that, unlike their rivals, they are more like pure plays in their end markets. For example, Navitas specializes in GaN and SiC chips for power conversion (not silicon), and 80% of Vertiv's revenue comes from data centers. Speaking of SiC and GaN chips,Aehr's(AEHR-3.13%)stock has soared recentlyon speculationthat Navitas might be a customer for Aehr's testing and burn-in equipment. Aehr's equipment helps semiconductor manufacturers ensure quality and reliability throughout the manufacturing process. Aehr has struggled recently as its revenue at SiC customers, includingON Semiconductor, has declined in light of pullbacks in EV investment. Still, Aehr is making good progress in opening up and winning customers in new markets, including GaN semiconductors and semiconductors for artificial intelligence (AI) processing. Image source: Getty Images. Synopsys is a leader in electronic design automation software (used to design and verify chips), and its intended acquisition of engineering simulation and analysis companyAnsysis a key event. The aim is to create a company offering design software, as well as simulation and analysis software to test the fruits of the design. It will also open up Synopsys' solutions to Ansys' wider range of end-market customers, particularly as semiconductors and electronics are increasingly being embedded in a range of new industries. The advanced materials company's lightweight composites are the future of the aerospace industry, as every new generation of airplane contains more composites. This meansHexcel(HXL0.06%)can grow as airplane production increases (AirbusandBoeinghave multiyear backlogs in place) and new, more composite-rich airplanes are developed. Hexcelhas faced headwindsin recent years as Airbus' and Boeing's delivery rates have fallen short of expectations, but it's only a matter of time before they improve. Cognex(CGNX-1.20%)is another company with excellent long-term secular growth prospects (the use of machine vision in automated processes) that has suffered near-term headwinds (weakness in key end markets like automotive and consumer electronics). Still, this is a temporary slowdown ina long-term growth story. PTC(PTC0.28%)provides computer-aided design (CAD), product lifecycle management (PLM), and other solutions essential to creating a so-called \"digital thread\" for a physical product as it moves from design through manufacturing, use, servicing, and ultimately disposal. As such,it's a leading playerin the digitization of the industrial sector. Trimble's(TRMB0.18%)precise positioning hardware (its origins) and growing software/services also make it aleading play on digitization. In Trimble's case, it's about integrating physical positioning with the digital world, such as in construction and infrastructure work, transportation, and geospatial activities. Through the use of advanced analytics in the digital world, Trimble's solutions can be integrated into its customers' daily workflows. Last but not least, Delta's growing mix of premium cabin revenue, loyalty program, co-brand card remuneration, and ability to adjust and compete in economy tickets when necessary means it's a much more diversified airline than a decade ago. In addition, as a network operator,it's much better positionedto deal with the growing cost pressures in the industry than low-cost carriers. Despite headwinds in 2025, it's ideally placed to generate value for shareholders over the long term.",

        "header": "AMD Runs Circles Around Intel With Helios Rack-Scale AI Systems",
        "content": "Intel(INTC-2.00%)made a run at the artificial intelligence (AI) accelerator market with its Gaudi line of chips, which came with the company's $2 billion acquisition of Habana. Unlike the graphics processing units (GPUs) fromNvidiaandAMD(AMD1.14%), Gaudi featured a different type of architecture that excelled in certain workloads. While Gaudi 3 wasn't up to par with Nvidia's leading AI accelerators when it launched,Intel offered attractive pricingas a way to lure customers. While Gaudi 3 won some high-profile customers,namely IBM for its watsonx platform, the chip was mostly a bust. Intel set a $500 million AI accelerator sales target for 2024, already a fraction of what Nvidia and AMD sell annually, andfailed to meet it. While Gaudi's pricing was attractive, an immature software ecosystem, an unfamiliar architecture, and a complicated roadmap from Intel conspired to keep customers away. Image source: Getty Images. Intel laterabandoned Falcon Shores, which was expected to be a traditional GPU that integrated some of Gaudi's features and was set to launch in 2025. Falcon Shores will no longer be a commercial product, and the new plan is to use its successor, Jaguar Shores, as the base for rack-scale AI solutions. This strategy makes sense. As AI infrastructure companies scale up data centers to include more densely packed accelerators, rack-scale solutions, which integrate GPUs, central processing units (CPUs), and other hardware across an entire server rack, can help solve thorny problems that are holding GPU clusters back. Essentially nothing is known about what Intel's rack-scale solutions are going to look like. With CEO Lip-Bu Tan taking over just a few months ago and ready to shake up the struggling company, it's not even clear whether Intel's AI strategy will change again. Tan installed a new chief technology officer (CTO) and AI chief in April who's in charge of Intel's overall AI strategy and product roadmap. Jaguar Shores almost certainly won't be ready until 2026, so any rack-scale solutions likely won't be either. Given all the changes going on at Intel, including upcoming layoffs meant to streamline the company, it could take Intel quite some time to land on a viable AI strategy and actually get competitive products and solutions to market. Meanwhile, competitor AMD is firing on all cylinders. AMD announced its next-generation Helios rack-scale AI solution earlier this month. Set for a 2026 launch alongside its powerful MI400 AI accelerator family, AMD plans to combine up to 72 GPUs with Venice EPYC CPUs that feature as many as 256 cores each, all tied together with UALink, an open interconnect standard. Helios will also feature AMD's Volcano AI networking cards from Pensando, which AMD acquired in 2022. These high-throughput network interface cards (NICs) will help with data transfer across large-scale AI deployments. AMD already hasOracleas a customer for its current rack-scale solution, which features the company's MI355X GPUs. Additionally,OpenAIis planning to use AMD's upcoming MI400 chips, according to CEO Sam Altman. While AMD remains in a distant second place behind Nvidia in the AI chip market, interest in its solutions seems to be picking up. By the time Intel manages to launch rack-scale AI solutions of its own, AMD may already have gained a significant foothold. That will make Intel's job harder as it tries to land on an AI strategy that works. While Intel is struggling to build an AI chip business of its own, the company's foundry business could ultimately be a major beneficiary of the AI chip boom. The Intel 18A process is going into volume production later this year, and the company's advanced packaging technology is getting plenty of interest from potential customers. In just a few years, Intel has staged an incredible comeback in manufacturing, closing the performance and efficiency gap withTSMC. If AI chip demand continues to boom, Nvidia, AMD, and the slew of tech giants designing custom AI chips could all seriously consider Intel for manufacturing. While Intel has failed to make a dent in the AI chip market so far, its foundry business could still allow it to participate in the AI boom.",

        "content": "FedEx (FDX) is slated to report earnings for the fourth quarter of its fiscal 2025 after the closing bell on Tuesday, with analysts largely bullish on the shipping giant's stock. Of the 14 analysts following the company who are tracked by Visible Alpha, 12 call FedEx a \"buy,\" while two others give it a \"hold\" or equivalent rating. The analysts have an average price target of $281, implying roughly 24% upside from Friday's close. The stock has lost nearly 20% of its value this year so far. FedEx's fourth-quarter revenue is expected to decline just over 1% from thesame time a year agoto $21.82 billion. Adjusted earnings per share, however, are expected to rise more than 8% to $5.88 as FedEx continues to work through its cost-cutting efforts. The previous quarter, FedEx missedestimatesand cut its full-year outlook for the third straight quarter, citing a \"very challenging operating environment.\" Ahead of the scheduled earnings report Tuesday, UBS analysts cut their price target for FedEx stock to $311 from $331. They lowered their estimate for the company's 2026 profit \"to reflect a more muted volume and revenue backdrop and meaningfully less margin improvement in both Federal Express (FEC) and Freight.\" Morgan Stanley analysts, with an \"underweight\" rating and a $200 price target, wrote earlier this month that they expect FedEx to missestimatesfor the fiscal fourth quarter. They said they expect a \"noisy miss\" despite it representing the final quarter of the company's \"DRIVE\" savings program, citing \"inflationary pressures, one fewer operating day, tariff-related volume headwinds, and [business-to-business] weakness,\" adding that fiscal 2026 outlook will likely be more important for the stock than Tuesday's fourth-quarter results.",

        "content": "While some volatility has reentered the market due to rising hostilities in the Middle East, this can still be a good time to invest in some growth stocks for the long term. Let's look at 10 monster growth stocks to buy for the long haul. Nvidia(NVDA-1.14%)has been one of the market's biggest winners, as itsgraphics processing units (GPUs)have become the backbone ofartificial intelligence (AI)infrastructure. That should continue as itsCUDAsoftware program has created a wide moat, helping it attain a 92% market share in the GPU space in the first quarter. With AI infrastructure demand continuing to rise, Nvidia is well-positioned for years of continued growth. Biggest risk:A slowdown in AI infrastructure spending. Image source: Getty Images. WhileBroadcom(AVGO-0.32%)is seeing strong growth from its networking portfolio, its biggest opportunity lies in helping customers develop custom AI chips. It projects that its three furthest along customers in this area will be a $60 billion to $90 billion market opportunity in fiscal 2027 alone. Meanwhile, it has added other big customers since then, includingApple.Biggest risk:A slowdown in AI infrastructure spending. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(TSM-1.76%)is the world's leading contract semiconductor manufacturer, producing chips for companies like Nvidia and Broadcom. Its technological expertise and scale have made it an invaluable part of the semiconductor value chain, allowing it to increase prices and expand margins. As AI infrastructure spending and other chip consumption grows, TSMC is set to be one of the biggest winners in the years ahead. Biggest risks:A slowdown in AI infrastructure spending and/orIntelbeing a more viable competitor. Originally a data-gathering and analytics company serving the U.S government,Palantir Technologies'(PLTR-2.06%)AI platform (AIP) has been gaining strong momentum in the U.S. commercial sector. The platform helps organizations gather data from a variety of sources and organize it into an \"ontology\" that connects the data to real-world assets and processes. This allows its customers to then use AI to solve complex, real-world problems. AIP is being used in a wide array of industries, which gives Palantir a huge growth runway ahead. Biggest risks:A high valuation and budget cuts at the U.S. government. Alphabet(GOOGL-3.89%)(GOOG-3.68%)is not only a leader in search, but it's seeing strong growth in itscloud computingand robotaxi businesses as well. Meanwhile, as the world moves toward AI-powered search, the company has huge distribution and ad network advantages. Alphabet's AI capabilities and ability to monetize content also should not be underestimated. While some see AI as a risk, more likely than not, it will be a growth driver for the company in the coming years. Biggest risks:AI disrupts its search business and harsh penalties from its antitrust trial. Amazon(AMZN-1.38%)is the market leader in both e-commerce and cloud computing. AWS continues to be its biggest growth driver, and the company is investing heavily in the business to capture the AI opportunity in front of it. At the same time, it's using AI to drive efficiencies and lower costs in its e-commerce operations, helping boost profitability.Biggest risks:A slowdown in consumer spending and overbuilding its data center infrastructure. Under the leadership of CEO Bill Ready,Pinterest(PINS-1.61%)has spent the last few years investing heavily to help transform its platform into one that is both more engaging and shoppable. Some of the newest features that have been rolled out to help support this vision are visual search and personalized recommendations. This has helped Pinterest not only grow its users, but more importantly, to start better monetizing them. Meanwhile, its new Performance+ solution, which integrates AI tools and automation to help advertisers run better campaigns, is expected to be a growth driver moving forward. Biggest risks:A slowdown in consumer spending and lower ad budgets. A growth stock in a defensive industry,Philip Morris International(PM-0.02%)is being led by its portfolio of smokeless products that includes the nicotine pouch Zyn and premium heated tobacco product Iqos. Best of all, these products have better unit economics than traditional cigarettes. Meanwhile, since it does not sell its cigarettes in the U.S., this business has held up well, with modest volume growth and strong pricing power. With Zyn a hit and Iqos set to be rolled out in the U.S., Philip Morris has solid growth ahead of it. Biggest risks:International markets begin to see volume declines like the U.S. and a failed launch of Iqos in the U.S. Dutch Bros(BROS-3.18%)has one of the most compelling growth stories in the restaurant space. It's been seeing solid same-store sales growth, but it really has an opportunity to accelerate that with the introduction of mobile ordering and the rollout of more food items on its menu. At its heart, though, Dutch Bros is an expansion story, and it has a huge runway on this front over the next decade. Biggest risk:The concept fails to resonate with consumers outside its core Western U.S. region. e.l.f. Beauty(ELF-1.74%)has been one of the fastest-growing cosmetic brands in the mass-market space over the past several years, taking considerable market share away from established players. However, when growth suddenly started to slow last quarter, the company took bold action and bought Hailey Bieber's emerging Rhode brand. Despite Rhode's huge success, it has a minimal product lineup, distribution, and marketing budget. This should give e.l.f. plenty of opportunity to grow the brand in the coming years. Biggest risks:Tariffs and the Rhode brand's popularity fades under its umbrella.",

        "content": "In the span of only a few years,Nvidia(NVDA-1.14%)has become one of thelargeststocks in the world. Indeed, as of this writing, the company boasts a market cap of more than $3.5 trillion, only slightly trailingMicrosoftas the world's largest company by market cap. The engine that propelled Nvidia's stock to these incredible heights has been its industry-leadinggraphics processing units (GPUs), whichare favoredby artificial intelligence (AI) developers for their power and speed. However, as the AI revolution rolls on, other companies may supplant Nvidia.Aside from the inevitable battle for GPUmarket share, other companies maybe better positionedto benefit from thenextphases of the AI revolution. And there's one stock that my decades of investing experience tell me is the one to watch. Image source: Getty Images. There are two things that standout about Nvidia's rise over the last three years: revenue and margin growth. First, the company's revenue hassimplygone through the roof as the AI revolution took flight.In 2022, Nvidia generated about $27 billion inrevenue. As of its most recent quarter (for the three months ending on Jan. 26), the company reported $130 billion in revenue.That's shockingly fast growth, and it's the reasonmost often cited for whyNvidia's share price has advanced by more than 800%. However, in addition to its incredible revenue growth, the company's margins widened.In 2022, the company'sgross marginstood around 60%. Today, it's around 70%. That's excellent and far ahead of the company's traditional competitors likeAdvance Micro DevicesandIntel.  NVDA Gross Profit Margindata byYCharts However, like all good things, this gross margin dominance willtocome to anend at somepoint,as competition heats up.Not only will AMD and Intel improve their designs and take market share, but new competitors will enter the market. Deep-pocketed players likeAlphabet,Amazon,Microsoft,Meta Platforms, andAppleare all at work on their own AI chipdesignsthat might eventually eat away at Nvidia's margins. So, as this market for AI chips becomes more saturated, who will benefit? My investing instincts point to one of the big buyers of AI chips. Ultimately, basic economics principles say that the buyers of AI chips will benefit as the AI chip market becomes more competitive. That is, as the price of AI chipsfall, the companies that buy the most chips will save money, resulting in higher profits. That's great news forAmazon,because, as the world's leadingcloud servicesprovider, it will need to spend heavily on AI chips for yearsto come. Amazon, through its Amazon Web Services division, controls around 30% of the cloud services market. That might not seem all that impressive, but consider this: Amazon's market share is roughly equal to thenexttwo largest providerscombined-- Microsoft and Alphabet. Moreover, the cloud infrastructure market is enormous (ataround $700 billion) and red-hot, growing at around 15% year over year. The rise of power AI systemsis only addingfuel to thefire,as companies look to cloud-based AI to deliver higher sales and lower costs. In short, the next phase of the AI revolution could see the focus shift away from AI infrastructure (GPUs) and toward practicalAI,as companies pour resources into cloud-based, AI-enhanced systems that help their organizations' operations. Nvidia remains the king of AI -- for now. However, as the AI revolution evolves, companies in the cloud services market could be the real winners. Furthermore, Amazon stock, with its leading position in that key market, could ultimately outperform Nvidia stock in the long term.",

The other Magnificent Seven companies may have a leg up on Alphabet in the AI market so far.Nvidia's(NVDA-1.14%)profitable sales growth is unbeatable. Revenue-based market shares suggest that the cloud computing solutions fromAmazon(AMZN-1.38%)andMicrosoft(MSFT-0.64%)are running circles around Google Cloud. But those proven and promised results are firmly baked into the stock prices. Nvidia stock trades at 47 times earnings and 49 times free cash flows today. Microsoft and Amazon have P/E ratios in the mid-30s and cash flow multiples well above Nvidia's. At the same time, Alphabet stock looks affordable at 19 times earnings and 28 times free cash flows.

From AI services to quantum computing systems, the company was built to thrive amid ever-changing markets and unexpected economy jolts. But the modeststock valuationis a great starting point for further research.",

        "header": "What Are the Top 5 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Right Now?",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI)has the potential to be the most important technological advancement in history, and it still appears to be in its early innings. As such, the space is still one of the most promising places to invest. When delving down to specific stocks to focus attention on, five of the best AI-related offerings to buy right now areNvidia(NVDA-1.14%),Broadcom(AVGO-0.32%),Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(TSM-1.76%),Palantir Technologies(PLTR-2.06%), andGitLab(GTLB-3.04%). Each company has found a unique niche in the AI sector to exploit, and each has big opportunities ahead. Let's look at why these are among the best AI stocks to invest in right now for the long term. Image source: Getty Images. Nvidia'sgraphics processing units (GPUs)have become the backbone of AI infrastructure. These powerful chips are used to help power AI workloads, and demand has been soaring. The company's wide moat, however, comes from itsCUDAsoftware platform. Nvidia launched CUDA two decades ago to allow developers to program its GPUs more easily. It pushed CUDA into universities and research institutions early on, which helped CUDA become the de facto software program for AI developers. In Q1, the company had an over 90% market share in the GPU space. As a result, where AI infrastructure spending goes, Nvidia is sure to follow. While a slowdown in data center spending would be a risk, right now, demand for AI chips is only getting bigger. This is being driven by cloudcomputing companiespouring money into AI infrastructure to keep up with demand; large tech companies and AI start-ups spending big to create new foundational AI models; and even countries making large investments to not fall behind in the AI race. As AI infrastructure spending continues to ramp up, Nvidia remains a clear winner. Another company taking advantage of the AI infrastructure build-out is Broadcom. Rather than designing GPUs like Nvidia, it's been focused on networking components and helping customers design custom AI chips. It also added a software component when it acquired VMWare. Thus far, its strategy is paying off. Its Ethernet switches and other networking components help efficiently move data within huge AI clusters, making them an essential part of data center infrastructure. Last quarter, its AI networking revenue soared 70% and accounted for 40% of Broadcom's total AI revenue. However, Broadcom's biggest long-term opportunity comes from helping customers design custom AI chips, which can offer better performance and lower power consumption than off-the-shelf GPUs. Demand is starting to pick up. Broadcom says its top three custom chip customers are on track to deploy 1 million AI chip clusters each by 2027, representing a total opportunity of between $60 billion to $90 billion. On the software side, Broadcom also benefits from transitioning VMWare customers from perpetual licenses to a subscription models and upgrading them to its VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) platform. VCF helps customers build hybrid and multi-cloud environments so they can manage workloads across public clouds and their own on-premises data centers. At the end of last quarter, 87% of its top 10,000 customers had adopted VCF. While an AI infrastructure spending slowdown is a risk, given its networking leadership, custom AI chip opportunity, and growing software revenue, Broadcom is well-positioned moving forward. While semiconductor companies garner most of the attention from investors, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is the company that actually manufactures most of these AI chips. It's the clear leader in advanced semiconductor manufacturing and a key partner to top customers like Nvidia,Apple, and Broadcom. Meanwhile, AI is driving its business. High-performance computing now makes up 59% of its revenue, up from 46% a year ago. Most of that comes from advanced nodes. Nodes refer to the manufacturing process used to make chips. The smaller the number (measured in nanometers), the more transistors you can pack onto a chip. This improves a chip's performance and power efficiency, and TSMC is the best in the world at making these at scale. And with rivals struggling to make advanced chips, this has given TSMC strong pricing power, as well. The biggest risk to TSMC is a slowdown in AI infrastructure spending, which would hit both revenue and fab utilization. However, the company is working closely with its largest customers to build out capacity in lockstep with their demand. With advanced-node capacity tight, TSMC is well-positioned to continue to be an AI infrastructure build-out winner. Palantir Technologies has emerged as a key player in the AI space. Instead of putting resources into developing AI models, the company focuses on the applications and workflow layers of AI to essentially develop an AI operating system. It does this by gathering data from a wide array of sources and organizing it into an ontology that links the data to its real-world counterparts. As a result, the company's AI Platform (AIP) can help organizations solve complex problems. This includes everything from monitoring sepsis in hospitals to streamlining underwriting processes in insurance. The sheer number of use cases across various industries that AIP can handle is just an enormous opportunity for Palantir moving forward. The company saw its revenue growth consistently accelerate over the past two years, including a 39% increase last quarter. The stock is not without risks, as it carries a high valuation and is exposed to government budget cuts, since the federal government is still its largest client. However, Palantir is unique in the AI space and has one of the biggest opportunities in front of it. GitLab is a leader in the DevSecOps space, offering a platform that helps developers build software securely. It's been an AI winner, as customers expand seats and upgrade to its higher-tier platforms as AI increases the customers' software development. GitLab is also helping customers become more productive with products like GitLab Duo, which uses AI to provide code suggestions and automation to streamline development. The company consistently delivered strong revenue growth of between 25% to 40% over the past two years and boasts impressivegross marginsand solidfree cash flow. It's also done a great job growing within its existing customer base, as evidenced by its 122%dollar-based net retentionover the past 12 months. Most of this is coming from seat expansions, followed by strong upgrades to higher-tiered offerings. While there has been concern that AI will replace coders, right now the opposite has been true, as GitLab's technology is being used to make software developers more productive, not replace them. This is driving strong growth and makes the company look like a solid long-term winner.",

        "header": "Intel Breakup? The Hidden Asset That Could Spark A Strategic Bid",
        "content": "Intel headquarters in Santa Clara, California, USA More - June 10, 2023. Intel Corporation is an American multinational corporation and technology company.Lessgetty Intel\u2019s once dominant position in the semiconductor industry has eroded into a cautionary tale. Does the current situation make the company vulnerable to a breakup or an acquisition bid?  While AMD and NVIDIA sprinted ahead, capturing market share, mindshare, and the AI growth narrative, Intel stalled. Its inability to execute on next-gen chip rollouts, capitalize on the foundry business, or maintain architectural leadership has left the company trailing in nearly every performance metric that matters.  In a prior Forbes piece, I made it clear: this decline isn\u2019t just a case of bad timing. The issue lies in cultural inertia, poor leadership choices, and a lack of visionary strategy, which have transformed Intel from a bellwether into a bloated, reactive giant. Its current leadership, while vocal about transformation, hasn\u2019t shown credible evidence of regaining the offensive.  The result? On paper, the stock appears inexpensive, but patience makes it feel costly. Investors have been clinging to the unfulfilled promise of a turnaround for years. It\u2019s not that Intel lacks valuable assets. The strategy to unlock these assets has been either muddled or entirely absent.  29 April 2025, USA, San Jose: Lip-Bu Tan, Chief More Executive Officer of Intel, appears at an event organized by the company. Photo: Andrej Sokolow/dpa (Photo by Andrej Sokolow/picture alliance via Getty Images)Lessdpa/picture alliance via Getty Images The Foundry Jewel In The Crown Opportunity Intel\u2019s foundry ambition was bold: to challenge TSMC and Samsung by becoming a full-service manufacturer for the world\u2019s chip designers. The logic was sound: own the infrastructure, capture margin, and secure Western chip sovereignty, but execution has been, at best, uneven. Capital costs have soared, returns remain distant, and Intel\u2019s credibility with major customers is still catching up after years of overpromising and underdelivering. The Street has largely discounted this effort, and it shows in the stock\u2019s multiple. But that may be a mistake. Here\u2019s the twist: in today\u2019s geopolitical climate, where semiconductors are national security assets, Intel\u2019s U.S.-based foundry operations are not just valuable, they\u2019re strategic. Governments want sovereign supply chains. Major chip designers want a domestic alternative to Asia. Intel is sitting on an asset uniquely positioned to benefit from this trend. Intel is no longer a single entity; it now encompasses two distinct narratives within its sprawling structure. On one side: a legacy chip business that\u2019s lost ground to AMD and Nvidia, plagued by inconsistent execution and a more reactive culture than visionary. On the other: a capital-heavy, misunderstood foundry business that, despite its growing pains, sits at the center of global chip sovereignty conversations. As the U.S. and EU pour billions into domestic semiconductor production, Intel\u2019s foundry arm has inadvertently become a geopolitical asset. Defense contractors seeking to secure supply chains, sovereign wealth funds with national mandates, and even Asian players seeking U.S. credibility are aware of this. While Intel\u2019s sheer scale and capital expenditure requirements may deter private equity, a consortium or strategic carve-out remains a viable option. What\u2019s actually at stake? That foundry value is trapped, held back by Intel\u2019s cumbersome structure, slow decision-making, and internal conflicts of interest. Split out, the foundry could pursue its customers, define its strategy, and attract the valuation it deserves. What will happen if Intel\u2019s leadership doesn\u2019t unlock that value? You can be sure someone else will try. Today\u2019s market quickly uncovers undervalued strategic assets.  Intel Breakup? Intel doesn\u2019t need another engineer at the helm. Intel requires a visionary leader who can simplify the story and establish clarity where bureaucracy has obscured the boundaries. A bold CEO would shrink the chip bloat, confront the underperformance head-on, and redirect capital into what matters: the foundry. They\u2019d monetize low-value, non-core businesses, create clean segment reporting, and reframe Intel not as a legacy chipmaker but as a national platform for advanced semiconductor manufacturing. Think of Microsoft under Nadella or IBM\u2019s pivot to services, only with sharper execution. The right leadership would embrace partnerships (even former rivals), tap government tailwinds, and focus the street\u2019s attention on the structural upside buried in the foundry. For an activist investor, the roadmap isn\u2019t complicated. Demand transparency between business units. Push for timeline clarity on unlocking foundry value, whether via partial spin, joint venture, or strategic equity participation. Pressure the board to explore structural separation. And above all, instill urgency. Because what Intel lacks is not capital, talent, or assets, it\u2019s the courage to act decisively. It\u2019s up to time whether this courage originates internally or is externally imposed. The real question is who will get there first and who\u2019ll profit from the move.Intel 5 years Vs NasdaqBarchart  MORE FOR YOU Breakup or Buyout? The biggest mispricing in Intel today isn\u2019t its margin compression or lagging revenue growth; it\u2019s the way the foundry is still being treated like a side project. Wall Street views it as a cost center rather than a strategic asset. That\u2019s the blind spot. Investors won\u2019t see a true earnings re-rating until they understand who is driving the company or who is about to take over. If the foundry sits buried beneath Intel\u2019s bloated structure, the market will continue to misread its upside. But that\u2019s starting to shift. Smart investors are watching for clues: insider buying, activist stake-building, tighter segment disclosure, JV chatter, and the sudden alignment of political and industrial interests around domestic chip sovereignty. As I recently stated, \u201cIntel\u2019s execution is subpar, yet its foundry presents a valuable asset.\u201d Breakup or buyout feels more plausible than the market\u2019s pricing in.\u201d Pay attention\u2014not just to the earnings, but to the structure. Once the market gains confidence in the foundry\u2019s independence or ownership, the valuation will not simply rebound. It will re-rate. Fast. Intel Breaking Up Is Hard To Do The longer Intel delays meaningful change, the more compelling the breakup case or bid opportunity becomes. The company is not a turnaround stock but rather a hidden restructuring opportunity. Investors who are astute should not wait for Intel to resolve its issues. What is the more advantageous option? That pressure, whether from activists, strategic buyers, or visionary CEOs, forces change from the outside in. The roadmap is clear. The foundry is in control. The rest is just capital, courage, and timing. The real question isn\u2019t if someone moves to secure an Intel bid or a breakup. The real question is not if someone makes a move on Intel, but rather who gets there first and whether you were already in a position when they did. Editorial StandardsReprints & Permissions",

        "header": "Could Nvidia's Projected 9% Annual Returns Through 2030 Be the Smartest Risk-Adjusted Play in Tech?",
        "content": "Forget chasing the nextartificial intelligence(AI) unicorn. While venture capitalists funnel billions into speculative start-ups,Nvidia(NVDA-1.14%)continues to dominate the infrastructure powering the entire industry. A projected 9% annual return may not sound thrilling, but it could be the smartest risk-adjusted investment in tech this decade. According to Coatue Management, an American technology-focused investment firm, Nvidia's market cap could grow from $3.5 trillion today to $5.6 trillion by 2030, implying a 9.6% compound annual growth rate from current levels. That's a far cry from its recent hypergrowth, but it reflects a business that's maturing into its role as the backbone of the AI economy. Image source: Getty Images. Here's why Nvidia remains a compelling buy -- even as its pace of growth slows. Think of Nvidia as theAppleof AI. Just as the iPhone represents great hardware backed by an impenetrable ecosystem, Nvidia has built something far more valuable than fast chips -- it has created the core operating system for AI. The company's Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) software platform has become the default language for AI development, with over 4 million developers now embedded in the ecosystem. Switching to a competitor means rewriting years of code, creating a switching cost that grows stronger every day. But Nvidia isn't stopping at software dominance. The company has systematically expanded into every layer of the AI stack. DGX Cloud lets companies rent AI supercomputers by the hour, democratizing access to massive computing power. New enterprise platforms help businesses deploy AI without armies of data scientists. The Omniverse platform powers everything from factory simulations to digital twins of entire cities, while the majority of automakers now rely on Nvidia's DRIVE platform for autonomous vehicle development. This isn't diversification for its own sake. Each new product strengthens the core GPU business. A company using Nvidia for robotics simulations naturally gravitates toward Nvidia chips for its data centers. The network effects compound with each customer. Yes, 9% annual returns sound pedestrian compared to Nvidia's recent rocket ride. But consider the mathematical reality -- when you're already generating $44 billion in quarterly revenue from a $3.5 trillion base, hypergrowth becomes virtually impossible. What matters is that this 9% comes with something venture-backed AI start-ups can't offer: Certainty. The company's Blackwell architecture was fully booked within months of launch, with shipments stretching into late 2025. In its most recent quarter, data center revenue surged 73% year over year to $39.1 billion, while gross margins -- excluding one-time charges -- hover above 70%. That's the kind of pricing power that competitors can only dream about. And with $54 billion in cash and marketable securities, Nvidia can weather any storm while continuing to invest aggressively. But here's what growth projections might be missing: Nvidia isn't just selling more chips to the same customers. It's expanding the entire AI market. Right now, AI remains largely confined to tech giants and cutting-edge enterprises -- not because of cost, but because of complexity. Nvidia's push to simplify deployment through easier tools, pre-trained models, and plug-and-play solutions removes the technical barriers. When every small business can implement AI without a team of engineers, the addressable market doesn't just grow -- it explodes. Think of local governments optimizing traffic patterns, small manufacturers predicting equipment failures, or family doctors using AI diagnostics. The market expansion opportunity dwarfs any competition concerns. Yes, Nvidia trades at aforward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratioof 34 -- a premium by traditional standards. And yes,Advanced Micro Devicesis gaining ground while cloud giants likeMicrosoftandAlphabetare building their own AI chips. Meanwhile, U.S. export restrictions have cut off a significant portion of China-related revenue, removing an estimated $8 billion in near-term sales. But what's the alternative? Betting on early stage AI start-ups with no profits, nomoat, and unproven demand? Nvidia's valuation isn't cheap, but it reflects something rare in tech: Dominance with durability. Wall Street keeps searching for the next big thing. But the best tech investment of the next decade may not come from a stealth start-up or a buzzy IPO. It's already here, hiding in plain sight. Nvidia, with its projected 9% annual returns, offers what's become rare in technology: Scale, certainty, and sustained innovation. While others gamble on speculative AI plays, Nvidia continues to compound wealth with the dependability of a utility and the velocity of a start-up. The AI revolution isn't slowing. It's accelerating. Every breakthrough, from autonomous vehicles to digital twins, reinforces Nvidia's grip on the infrastructure that powers it all. Sometimes the smartest move isn't chasing the next Nvidia. It's owning the one that already reshaped the future -- and is still just getting started.",

        "header": "Should You Buy Nvidia Stock Hand Over Fist Before June 25?",
        "content": "Nvidia(NVDA-1.14%)will hold its 2025 shareholder meeting in three days. Should you buy Nvidia stock hand over fist before June 25? No -- at least, not because of the meeting. That doesn't mean scooping up shares of thegraphics processing unit (GPU)maker over the next few days is a bad move, though. Some corporate events can provide huge catalysts for stocks. Quarterly earnings releases are one obvious example. Major product announcements are another. Annual shareholder meeting? Not so much. However, there are other reasons you might want to buy Nvidia stock sooner rather than later. Image source: Nvidia. For the most part, Nvidia's annual shareholder meeting this week will probably be boring. First on the agenda is to elect the board of directors. Unless something truly shocking happens, the nominated slate of directors should be a shoo-in. Next up is a vote on advisory approval of executive compensation, commonly referred to as \"say-on-pay.\" This allows shareholders to voice their approval or disapproval of Nvidia's executive compensation plan for the next year. However, the vote isn't binding on the board of directors. Maybe the selection of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as Nvidia's independent accounting firm will excite some investors, but I doubt it. Either way, it's the next item on the agenda. At last year's annual meeting, shareholders approved a nonbinding proposal requesting the board to eliminate supermajority voting provisions in Nvidia's charter and bylaws. After consideration, the board decided to recommend changing those documents. As a result, eliminating the supermajority voting provisions will be officially voted on at the upcoming meeting (and will, somewhat ironically, require a supermajority vote of 66 2/3% of shareholders to become effective). On a similar note, three stockholder proposals are on the agenda this year: Nvidia's board recommended shareholders vote against these proposals. Even if the proposals are approved, though, none would affect the stock. It's possible that something interesting could arise during the \"other matters\" part of the company's annual shareholder meeting, but I wouldn't bet on it. If you're looking for a catalyst for Nvidia stock, you'll probably have to wait a while longer. The next scheduled event that could cause shares to rise won't be until the company reports its fiscal year 2026 second-quarter results on Aug. 27, 2025. However, it's entirely possible that this Q2 update won't move the needle much. Nvidia would need to blow past earnings estimates or reveal something else that's really positive to have a significant effect on the stock. Just because Nvidia's annual shareholder meeting will likely be a big nothingburger doesn't mean buying the stock hand over fist before June 25 is a bad idea. Actually, for long-term investors, it could be a smart move. From my perspective, the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) is only in its early stages, and the rise of AI agents could provide a significant tailwind for Nvidia. So could progress in developingartificial general intelligence (AGI). While I can imagine a future where Nvidia isn't at the forefront of the AI chip market, I think it's much more likely that the company will remain a key player. Nvidia's Blackwell GPU is the best AI chip available. The company's roadmap of new products each year should keep Nvidia ahead of the pack. Sure, valuation is a perennial objection to buying the stock. I've raised the question myself in the past. However, if the AI market unfolds like I suspect it will, Nvidia's growth will justify its current valuation. Investors won't miss the opportunity if they don't buy the stock before June 25. But if you believe in Nvidia's potential, there's no time like the present.",

        "header": "Nvidia vs Microsoft Stock: Which Will Reach $4 Trillion First?",
        "content": "At the end of 2024, tech analyst Dan Ives predictedNvidia(NVDA-1.14%),Microsoft(MSFT-0.64%), andApple(AAPL2.22%)would all reach a $4 trillion valuation in 2025. He expected Apple to hit the mark first, followed by Nvidia, and then Microsoft. But I think he got the order reversed: Microsoft will reach a $4 trillion valuation first. Both Nvidia and Microsoft currently have market caps around $3.5 trillion, while Apple has seen its stock fall to about $3 trillion in market cap. The leading tech giants have received a clear boost fromartificial intelligence(AI) spending, but Apple has struggled to make headway in advanced AI capabilities. As a result, it looks like either Nvidia or Microsoft will reach the $4 trillion valuation threshold first. And despite strong operating results from Nvidia, Microsoft looks to have the edge. Image source: Getty Images. Nvidia's strong results over the last few years were driven by unprecedented growth in itsdata centerbusiness. For the first quarter, data center revenue climbed 73% year over year. The hyperscale customers like Microsoft are buying Nvidia's GPUs as fast as it can produce them. In fact, management says it remains supply-constrained, so revenue growth should stay robust throughout the rest of the year. However, the company is heavily reliant on a handful of customers, including Microsoft. If those customers pull back on AI spending or shift to different chip suppliers, it could see a significant slowdown in revenue growth. It faces plenty ofchallenges from other GPU makersand custom silicon solutions designed in partnership with the hyperscalers themselves. Several of them are working to build chips for bothtrainingandinferencethat offer better price performance than Nvidia's all-in-one solution. So, while the GPU maker should continue to grow its top line extremely quickly, it comes with some significant risks that investors shouldn't ignore. The stock currently trades around 34 times earnings. That's not a completely unreasonable price to pay for a stock growing as fast as Nvidia is, and with such a dominant position in AI, but it does leave a lot of downside if it faces any setbacks in its operations. Microsoft has seen strong results for its Azurecloud computingplatform over the last few years, thanks, in part, to its partnership withOpenAI. The company invested an additional $10 billion in the generative AI leader at the start of 2023, boosting its cloud platform as well as its own enterprise software's AI capabilities. The relationship between the two companies has become strained as Microsoft develops its own AI models, but it still looks to have cemented its position in the cloud. To that end, the company is investing heavily to build out its data center capacity. It expects to finish out its fiscal year with $80 billion incapital expenditures, mostly related to building out AI data centers. Management continued to tell investors it's supply-constrained during its third-quarter earnings call. Azure revenue growth is accelerating, up 33% in the most recent quarter. That's faster than its competitors, and a large portion of that is driven by demand for AI training and inference. As a result, Microsoft should see continued strong revenue growth for Azure, driving the entire business's performance. The rest of the company benefits from AI as well. Its Microsoft 365 service integrates its Copilot software, and has increased both commercial and consumer customers at a double-digit rate. The company's Copilot Studio makes it easy for enterprises to integrate their own data into an AI system to build their own specialized AI agents, further locking them into its enterprise software ecosystem and paving the way for growth. Microsoft stock is priced on par with Nvidia's shares right now. But the former company's diversified business with both enterprise software and cloud computing stands on very solid footing, with those two areas showing strong growth and improving profitability. That makes it more attractive as a stock and more likely to reach the $4 trillion mark first.",

        "header": "10 No-Brainer Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI)is rapidly changing the world we live in, making it a must-invest sector. Let's look at 10 AI stocks to invest in right now. The king of AI,Nvidia's(NVDA-1.14%)graphic processing units (GPUs)have become the backbone of AI infrastructure due to their fast processing speeds. However, it's the company'sCUDAsoftware platform that has helped create a wide moat for the company. CUDA lets developers easily program its chips, while it's also built a collection of tools and libraries to optimize its GPUs to run AI tasks. In Q1, the company had a whopping 92% market share in the GPU space. As AI infrastructure continues to ramp up, Nvidia is well-positioned to continue benefiting. Image source: Getty Images. While a distant second to Nvidia in the GPU space,Advanced Micro Devices(AMD1.12%)has become a leader incentral processing units (CPUs), which act as the brains of the operation, within the data center. The company has also been able to carve out a niche for its GPUs withAI inference, which is less technically demanding than training AI models and where costs are a more important consideration. With inference eventually expected to become a much larger market than training, AMD has a big opportunity in front of it, even if it only takes some modest market share away from Nvidia. Broadcom(AVGO-0.32%)has been seeing strong momentum with its networking portfolio, which is becoming more valuable as AI clusters grow in size and require more high-throughput, low-latency interconnects. However, its biggest opportunity lies in custom AI chips, where the company is starting to help customers develop their own custom chips to handle specific AI workloads. After successfully helpingAlphabet(GOOGL-3.89%)(GOOG-3.68%)develop its Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), it's been adding more custom chip customers. It sees its three furthest-along customers as having between a $60 billion to $90 billion serviceable market in fiscal 2027, and that doesn't even include new customers likeApple. This is a huge opportunity for Broadcom. While the above three companies design advanced AI chips,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(TSM-1.76%)is the one they hire to actually make them. As such, it benefits no matter who becomes the biggest AI chip winner. TSMC's scale and technological expertise have set it apart in the foundry space, as rivals have struggled. This has led the company to become an invaluable cog in the semiconductor supply chain. With growing manufacturing capacity and strong pricing power, TSMC is very well positioned to benefit from growing AI chip demand. While TSMC manufactures advanced chips,ASML(ASML-0.66%)is the company that makes the machines that make it possible to produce these chips. It has a virtual monopoly on extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, which is the equipment used in advanced chip manufacturing. It also introduced its next-generation technology, high-NA (numerical aperture) EUV, that will allow for higher density chips. While TSMC has balked at the high price ($400 million) of these new machines, it cannot afford to get bypassed on the technological front by a competitor likeIntel. As such, ASML should be a long-term winner as foundries continue to increase capacity and start looking toward even more advanced nodes (smaller, more powerful chips). While best known for its e-commerce business,Amazon(AMZN-1.38%)is also the largestcloud computingcompany in the world. In fact, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is its largest segment by profitability and its fastest growing, as it benefits from helping customers build their own AI models and apps and run them on its cloud infrastructure. The company is investing heavily in new data center infrastructure to keep up with AI demand. In addition, Amazon is using AI throughout its e-commerce operations to make its business more efficient and reduce costs. This combination bodes well for Amazon being a long-term AI winner. Alphabet is also a cloud computing giant, where it is benefiting from many of the same trends as Amazon. As an added benefit, Google Cloud just hit an inflection point, with its profitability now beginning to soar. While there is some worry about the impact of AI on its core Google search business, the company is embracing the technology and doing what it does best: connecting consumers with merchants. Meanwhile, the advantages that Alphabet's strong distribution and entrenched ad network give it should not be underestimated. Meta Platforms(META-1.88%)has been at the forefront of AI with its Llamalarge language model (LLM). The company is using AI to both keep users more engaged on its social media apps, as well as help advertisers create better campaigns and more precisely target potential customers. This is leading to more ad inventory and higher ad prices, since its ads are becoming more effective. In addition, the company has just started serving ads on its popular WhatsApp messaging app, and it is building out a new social media site, Threads. This should provide the company with a solid runway of growth ahead. Instead of building out its own models,Palantir Technologies(PLTR-2.06%)has taken a different approach to AI, essentially looking to become the orchestration layer, or operating system, for the technology. It does this by gathering data from a wide array of sources and structuring it into an ontology that connects digital assets with their real-world counterparts. This then allows its customers to use its platform to solve complex, real-world problems through the use of AI. The platform can be used for numerous applications across industries, which means Palantir has a huge opportunity ahead. After bringing thesoftware-as-service (SaaS)model to the mainstream,Salesforce(CRM0.49%)is now looking to become the leader in agentic AI, where AI agents will go out and perform tasks with little to no human interaction. The company is looking to help create a digital workforce by tightly integrating its Agentforce platform, Data Cloud solution, apps, and metadata framework. Together, it believes this will allow agents to better understand customer intent and perform tasks more effectively. As a consumption-based solution, AI agents are a huge opportunity for the company.",

        "header": "Exclusive-DeepSeek aids China's military and evaded export controls, US official says",
        "content": "By Michael Martina and Stephen Nellis WASHINGTON/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -AI firm DeepSeek is aiding China's military and intelligence operations, a senior U.S. official told Reuters, adding that the Chinese tech startup sought to use Southeast Asian shell companies to access high-end semiconductors that cannot be shipped to China under U.S. rules. Hangzhou-based DeepSeek sent shockwaves through the technology world in January, claiming itsartificial intelligencereasoning models were on par with or better than U.S. industry-leading models at a fraction of the cost. \"We understand that DeepSeek has willingly provided and will likely continue to provide support to China's military and intelligence operations,\" a senior State Department official told Reuters in an interview. \"This effort goes above and beyond open-source access to DeepSeek's AI models,\" the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity in order to speak about U.S. government information. The U.S. government's assessment of DeepSeek's activities and links to the Chinese government have not been previously reported and come amid a wide-scale U.S.-China trade war. Among the allegations, the official said DeepSeek is sharing user information and statistics with Beijing's surveillance apparatus. Chinese law requires companies operating in China to provide data to the government when requested. But the suggestion that DeepSeek is already doing so is likely to raise privacy and other concerns for the firm's tens of millions of daily global users. The U.S. also maintains restrictions on companies it believes are linked to China's military-industrial complex. U.S. lawmakers have previously said that DeepSeek, based on its privacy disclosure statements, transmits American users' data to China through \"backend infrastructure\" connected to China Mobile, a Chinese state-owned telecommunications giant. DeepSeek did not respond to questions about its privacy practices. The company is also referenced more than 150 times in procurement records for China's People's Liberation Army and other entities affiliated with the Chinese defense industrial base, said the official, adding that DeepSeek had provided technology services to PLA research institutions. Reuters could not independently verify the procurement data. The official also said the company was employing workarounds to U.S. export controls to gain access to advanced U.S.-made chips. The U.S. conclusions reflect a growing skepticism in Washington that the capabilities behind the rapid rise of one of China's flagship AI enterprises may have been exaggerated and relied heavily on U.S. technology. DeepSeek has access to \"large volumes\" of U.S. firm Nvidia's high-end H100 chips, said the official. Since 2022 those chips have been under U.S. export restrictions due to Washington's concerns that China could use them to advance its military capabilities or jump ahead in the AI race. \"DeepSeek sought to use shell companies in Southeast Asia to evade export controls, and DeepSeek is seeking to access data centers in Southeast Asia to remotely access U.S. chips,\" the official said. The official declined to say if DeepSeek had successfully evaded export controls or offer further details about the shell companies. DeepSeek also did not respond to questions about its acquisition of Nvidia chips or the alleged use of shell companies. When asked if the U.S. would implement further export controls or sanctions against DeepSeek, the official said the department had \"nothing to announce at this time.\" China's foreign ministry and commerce ministry did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. \"We do not support parties that have violated U.S. export controls or are on the U.S. entity lists,\" an Nvidia spokesman said in a prepared statement, adding that \"with the current export controls, we are effectively out of the China data center market, which is now served only by competitors such as Huawei.\" ACCESS TO RESTRICTED CHIPS DeepSeek has said two of its AI models that Silicon Valley executives and U.S. tech company engineers have showered with praise \u2013 DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeek-R1 \u2013 are on par withOpenAIand Meta's most advanced models. AI experts, however, have expressed skepticism, arguing the true costs of training the models were likely much higher than the $5.58 million the startup said was spent on computing power. Reuters has previously reported that U.S. officials were investigating whether DeepSeek had access to restricted AI chips. DeepSeek has H100 chips that it procured after the U.S. banned Nvidia from selling those chips to China, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters, adding that the number was far smaller than the 50,000 H100s that the CEO of another AI startup had claimed DeepSeek possesses in a January interview with CNBC. Reuters was unable to verify the number of H100 chips DeepSeek has. \"Our review indicates that DeepSeek used lawfully acquired H800 products, not H100,\" an Nvidia spokesman said, responding to a Reuters query about DeepSeek's alleged usage of H100 chips. In February, Singapore charged three men with fraud in a case domestic media have linked to the movement of Nvidia's advanced chips from the city state to DeepSeek. China has also been suspected of finding ways to use advanced U.S. chips remotely. While importing advanced Nvidia chips into China without a license violates U.S. export rules, Chinese companies are still allowed to access those same chips remotely in data centers in non-restricted countries. The exceptions are when a Chinese company is on a U.S. trade blacklist or the chip exporter has knowledge that the Chinese firm is using its chips to help develop weapons of mass destruction. U.S. officials have not placed DeepSeek on any U.S. trade blacklists yet and have not alleged that Nvidia had any knowledge of DeepSeek's work with the Chinese military. Malaysia's trade ministry said last week that it was investigating whether an unnamed Chinese company in the country was using servers equipped with Nvidia chips for large language model training and that it was examining whether any domestic law or regulation had been breached.

        "header": "Move over, Magnificent 7: Goldman Sachs proposes the \u2018Prom 10,\u2019 China\u2019s top stocks including Tencent, Alibaba and BYD",
        "content": "Investors are flocking to Chinese markets in a search for alternatives to U.S. equities. DeepSeek\u2019s AI breakthrough earlier this year proved that China couldcompete on the technological frontier. Economists are betting that Beijing might finally unleash more stimulus to revive flagging domestic consumption. And policy volatility in Washington, thanks to U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war, ispushing investorsto start diversifying their portfolios away from the U.S. It\u2019s a big shift from earlier arguments that Chinese companies were \u201cuninvestable\u201d due to concerns about policy uncertainty and China\u2019s sluggish economy. Hong Kong\u2019s benchmark Hang Seng Index is up by over 20% so far this year, even as Trump threatened steep tariffs on imports from China. By comparison, the S&P 500 is up by around 2%. Investors have used the \u201cMagnificent 7\u201d\u2014Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla\u2014as shorthand for the top-performing stocks on U.S. markets. These seven companies both reflect U.S. strength in Big Tech and tap into major trends like AI. But what about China? Investment bank Goldman Sachs, in a report released last week, highlighted 10 stocks that are best poised for growth in the Chinese market. Together, they make up what the bank calls the \u201cProminent 10\u201d, or \u201cProm 10\u201d for short. Unlike the Magnificent 7, these stocks cover more than just tech and AI, extending into retail and other consumer services. Together, the stocks amount to $1.6 trillion in market value, according to Goldman Sachs, compared to $19 trillion for the Mag 7. The bank predicts that the Prom 10\u2019s earnings will grow by an average of 13% annually over the next two years. The Prom 10 \u201ccollectively embody the theme of AI/Tech development, self-sufficiency, \u2018Going Global\u2019, services and new forms of consumption, and China\u2019s improving shareholder returns,\u201d Goldman Sachs wrote in its report. The bank also suggests that its chosen companies have more opportunities to expand and consolidate their positions in the more fragmented Chinese economy. The most valuable company on the Prom 10 is Tencent, one of the world\u2019s largest video game publishers and operator of the ubiquitous WeChat messaging app. Tencent\u2019s superapp is one of a handful of platforms that boasts over a billion users. Valued at around $585 billion, Tencent is Asia\u2019s second-most valuable company, behind chipmaker TSMC. E-commerce giant Alibaba is also on the Prom 10. Shares in the company are up more than 35% so far this year, thanks to optimism around AI. Developers both inside and outside of China are embracing the company\u2019s open-source Qwen model, making Alibabathe AI leaderamong the country\u2019s big tech companies. Meituan, China\u2019s food delivery giant, is another Prom 10 stock. The company holds a 70% market share in the delivery space, and is expanding to new markets like Hong Kong, Saudi Arabia, and Brazil. Yet the stock has taken a beating in recent weeks due tofierce competitionfrom JD.com, another e-commerce giant. BYD, the world\u2019s largest producer of electric vehicles, and Xiaomi, a major Chinese smartphone brand that\u2019s recently expanded to cars, also hold spots in Goldman Sachs\u2019 \u201cProm 10.\u201d Chinese EVs are quickly winning over customers both in China and overseas, due to the affordable price points and appealing designs. That\u2019s helped boost the shares of both companies: BYD and Xiaomi are up by around 45% and 60% respectively. Midea Group is one of China\u2019s leading manufacturers of home appliances and another Prom 10 stock.The company debuted onHong Kong\u2019s stock exchangelast year, raising almost $4 billion. Tencent, Alibaba, Meituan, Xiaomi, BYD, and Midea are all onFortune\u2019sGlobal 500, which ranks the world\u2019s largest companies by revenue. Rounding out the Prom 10 are NetEase Games, the second-highest grossing gaming company in China; Hengrui, a leading pharmaceutical manufacturer; Trip.com, a travel booking platform; and ANTA, the world\u2019s third-largest sportswear company, behind Nike and Adidas.

        "content": "Chicago, IL \u2013 June 23, 2025 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Palantir Technologies PLTR, Newmont NEM, NVIDIA NVDA, Microsoft MSFT and AngloGold Ashanti PLC AU. The first half of 2025 has been defined by heightened volatility and uncertainty, largely stemming from the new administration\u2019s trade policies. After hitting a low in early April, Wall Street staged a strong rebound fueled by renewed optimism over trade negotiations, solid corporate earnings, easing inflation and continued momentum in artificial intelligence. Technology stocks led the charge, with the Magnificent Seven making a powerful comeback after months of turbulence. As the half-year mark approaches, the S&P 500 is now less than 3% below its record high, while the Nasdaq Composite is 3.4% off its all-time peak. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, however, remains only marginally positive for the year. Volatility is expected to persist in the second half. Let\u2019s discuss these events in detail below with the stocks: On April 2, Donald Trump announced sweeping new tariffs dubbed \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs. These included a 10% baseline tariff on nearly all imports, with a few exceptions such as pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and lumber. On top of the baseline, Trump introduced \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs that targeted specific countries. China faced tariffs ranging from 34% to 54%, the European Union 20%, Japan 24% and Vietnam up to 46%. These tariffs officially took effect on April 9. Facing backlash and international criticism, the Trump administration issued a 90-day pause on tariff hikes for over 75 countries on May 12, though the 10% baseline tariff remained in place. Additionally, Chinese tariffs were reduced from a peak of 145% to around 30%, though they remained substantially elevated. On May 30, Trump doubled tariffs on imported steel, raising them from 25% to 50%, citing national security concerns and the need to protect U.S. industry. These actions faced legal scrutiny. On May 28, the U.S. Court of International Trade ruled that many of the tariffs were illegal under international trade law. However, the court also issued a stay, meaning the tariffs would remain in place pending appeals. These tariff policies triggered an initial market rout, with trillions lost in just days. However, the partial pause in tariffs and the Fed\u2019s decision to hold interest rates steady led to a strong rebound. Some sectors emerged as clear winners. Companies likePalantir Technologiessurged more than 90% since the April sell-off and recently hit a new all-time high. The stock saw a solid earnings estimate revision of 3 cents over the past 60 days for this year and has an estimated growth of 41.46%. Palantir Technologies has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and a Growth Score of A. The S&P 500 hit a record high on Feb. 19 before tumbling toward bear market territory by April 8. However, the index staged a remarkable rebound, marking its fastest recovery since 1982. In May, it delivered the strongest performance since 1990 and the biggest monthly gain since November 2023. Buoyed by this turnaround, a growing number of Wall Street strategists have turned bullish in recent weeks. Several firms have raised their year-end S&P 500 targets to the 6,300\u20136,500 range, reflecting renewed confidence in the market\u2019s outlook for the second half of 2025. Newmont, having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), is one of the best-performing stocks of the first half. The stock saw a positive earnings estimate revision of 5 cents for this year over the past month, with an estimated growth rate of 20.1%. Newmont has a VGM Score of A, indicating that it is poised for more gains ahead. You can seethe complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. The race for the title of the world\u2019s most valuable publicly traded company has intensified in 2025, withNVIDIAandMicrosoftlocked in a high-stakes battle for market cap supremacy. Fueled by the explosive growth of artificial intelligence, the rivalry has captured Wall Street\u2019s full attention and is reshaping the tech landscape in real time. As of June 18, Microsoft held a slight lead with a market capitalization exceeding $3.57 trillion. Its ascent was driven by robust cloud expansion, deepening AI integrations through its partnership with OpenAI, and continued dominance in the enterprise software space. NVIDIA, meanwhile, is capitalizing on an unprecedented demand cycle for its AI chips, rapidly scaling sales of its GPUs that power the very heart of AI computing. Since bottoming at just over $94 in early April, NVDA stock has added more than $1 trillion in market value. Growth-focused traders are flocking to NVIDIA for its unprecedented AI chip momentum, high margins and dominant position in next-gen computing. In essence, NVIDIA may be building the engine of the AI revolution, but Microsoft is constructing the operating system around it. Azure continues to be one of the fastest-growing cloud platforms globally, while Microsoft 365 and Teams have become indispensable tools in the modern digital workplace. Microsoft and NVIDIA have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) each. Gold stocks have surged in popularity this year, driven by a flight to safety amid growing global uncertainty. Investors are turning to the precious metal to shield their portfolios from the disruptive impact of Trump\u2019s tariffs on global trade and rising concerns of an economic slowdown. Gold recently soared to a new all-time high, topping $3,400 per ounce last month. Escalating tensions in the Middle East\u2014particularly the Israel-Iran conflict\u2014have intensified safe-haven demand, pushing both gold prices and gold-related equities higher. Additionally, a weaker U.S. dollar and continued central bank accumulation have further fueled gold\u2019s rally. Goldman Sachs forecasts that gold could climb to $3,700 per ounce by the end of 2025, reinforcing the bullish outlook for the metal and gold stocks. Among the potential beneficiaries isAngloGold Ashanti PLC, a global gold mining company with operations across Africa, the Americas and Australia. The company has seen a solid earnings estimate revision of 60 cents over the past 30 days for this year, with an estimated growth of 122.1%. Despite more than doubling year to date, AngloGold remains attractively valued, trading at a P/E ratio of 9.80 compared with the industry average of 3.26. The stock sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has a VGM Score of A, underscoring its compelling investment potential amid the ongoing gold rally. Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of+48.4%, +50.2%and+56.7%per year.

        "content": "Nike (NKE) is slated to post its final earnings report of its 2025 fiscal year after the market closes Thursday, with analysts expecting falling sales and profits as the apparel maker works on its turnaround plan. Nike is projected to report a 15% drop in quarterly revenue from the same time last year to $10.71 billion. Earnings per share are also expected to have dropped to $0.12 from $0.99 a year ago. The companywarned in Marchthat it would likely take a sales hit in the fourth quarter from the Trump administration's tariffs and from itsturnaround plan. New CEO Elliott Hill, whotook over last October, has said Nike needs to focus on innovating with new products, as it manages the inventory of older legacy lines of shoes and clothing. Of the 17 analysts covering Nike tracked by Visible Alpha, eight call the stock a \"buy,\" while another eight say it's a \"hold,\" and just one rates it a \"sell.\" Those analysts have an average price target of $72, which is near where Nike shares started the year, suggesting analysts think the stock can recover most of its lost value. The stock has fallen about 21% in 2025 so far. In a note previewing Nike's report, Morgan Stanley analysts recently cut their price target to $61 from $70, saying they expect Nike's turnaround plan could take longer than expected as it faces macroeconomic pressures and uncertainty around tariffs. \"While our latest wholesale & specialty run checks suggested mgmt.\u2019s initial strategy execution is on the right track, we simultaneously view the road to improved fundamentals as long(er) than prior & still highly volatile,\" the analysts wrote. Bank of America analysts, with a more bullish $80 price target, said they will be more focused on Nike's outlook than fourth-quarter results, while noting that \"it's unclear what other guidance will be given beyond 1Q\" considering the macro uncertainty. Executives will need to provide clarity to investors on when Nike will be through its excess inventory, and when sales and profits will be able to return to growth, they wrote.",

Uh what I think is going to drive it is uh first and foremost, uh, you know, there, they had a few uh months in between where it was harder for them to ship a lot of uh their new racks, right, the new Blackwell and Blackwell Ultra racks. Now I think that log jam has been cleared up, so they are shipping them uh with very high intensity. You know, number two, I think people were concerned about what happens with restrictions in China, and now China is basically out of of their model, right? In fact, if I look at the entire semiconductor industry, right, that the names that we cover, Nvidia has the lowest exposure to China right now and is still able to put up, you know, growth rates that are in excess of 40 to uh 50%. So I think as as people start to realize that uh these concerns about the spending environment, about China restrictions are in the rear view mirror, I think there will be a lot more interest in going after this name because if you take a step back, um look across the S&P 500, right? It's trading at two times earnings growth. If you look at the so-called Mac 6 or Mac 7 outside of uh Nvidia, they are trading at two and a half to three times earnings growth, and you have Nvidia stock that is trading less than one times earnings growth. So we think it is um, you know, it is really a value stock at at these uh levels uh given the kind of growth opportunity, uh the kind of earnings leverage that uh they have in their model. And then finally, this opportunity is not just limited to what we see today, which is AI. In another few years, we will start to talk more about AI, about robotics, about autonomous cars, and the company's technology is very leverageable into a lot of these new markets as well.",

        "content": "Nebius Group N.V.NBIS has captured investor attention with its explosive growth and ambitious 2025 targets of $750 million to $1 billion in annualized run-rate revenue (ARR) and $500\u2013$700 million in total revenues. Following a remarkable 385% year-over-year revenue increase in the first quarter of 2025 and a 700% surge in ARR, the company appears well-positioned to pursue its goals. ARR reached $310 million in April, indicating strong momentum for the second quarter. The company is gaining from solid growth in its core artificial intelligence (AI) business. As organizations increasingly invest in generative AI, Nebius is benefiting from a full-stack approach, offering everything from high-performance GPU cloud infrastructure to Saturn Cloud\u2019s MLOps platform and AI development tools. Backed by a $700 million funding round involving high-profile investors like NVIDIA and Accel in December 2024, Nebius is expanding aggressively in North America and Europe. It aims to leverage this capital to meet customer demand while maintaining flexibility in pricing and cost management. In June 2025, NBIS announced private placement of $1 billion in convertible notes to capitalize on the AI-infrastructure boom and drive-up revenue opportunities in 2026. The company holds a minority stake of approximately 28% in ClickHouse. Recent media reports suggest that a fundraising round is currently in progress, potentially valuing ClickHouse at around $6 billion. The company expects adjusted EBITDA to turn positive in the second half of 2025. Global demand for AI-specific infrastructure is booming, with hyperscalers, startups and enterprises increasing GPU investments. Per IDC\u2019s forecast, AI infrastructure spending is projected to reach $223 billion by 2028, with servers deployed in cloud environments accounting for 82% of the total market and accelerated servers comprising approximately 74% of total market spending. That said, increasing market competition and macroeconomic uncertainties may adversely impact NBIS\u2019 growth trajectory. Nebius competes with technology giants likeCoreWeave, Inc.CRWV andMicrosoft CorporationMSFT. CoreWeave is an AI-focused hyperscaler company, and its cloud platform has been designed to scale, support and accelerate GenAI.

        "header": "Intel vs. NVIDIA: Which AI-Focused Chip Stock is the Better Buy?",
        "content": "Intel CorporationINTC andNVIDIA CorporationNVDA are two premier semiconductor firms focusing on AI (artificial intelligence) and advanced chip technologies. Intel, reportedly the world\u2019s largest semiconductor company and primary supplier of microprocessors and chipsets, is gradually reducing its dependence on the PC-centric business by moving into data-centric businesses, such as AI and autonomous driving. The foundry operating model is a key component of the company's strategy and is designed to reshape operational dynamics and drive greater transparency, accountability and focus on costs and efficiency.NVIDIA is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU. Over the years, the company\u2019s focus has evolved from PC graphics to AI-based solutions that support high-performance computing (HPC), gaming and virtual reality (VR) platforms. NVIDIA\u2019s GPU success can be attributed to its parallel processing capabilities, supported by thousands of computing cores, which are essential for running deep learning algorithms. The company\u2019s GPU platforms are playing a significant role in developing multi-billion-dollar end-markets, such as robotics and self-driving vehicles.With growing AI proliferation in PCs, smartphones, automotive and IoT applications, both Intel and Nvidia are steadily advancing their semiconductor portfolio to bolster their competitive edge. Let us analyze in depth the competitive strengths and weaknesses of the companies to understand who is in a better position to maximize gains from the emerging market trends. Intel is investing to expand its manufacturing capacity to accelerate its IDM 2.0 (Integrated Device Manufacturing) strategy. The company is making various decisions to gain a firmer footing in the expansive AI sector. Its latest Xeon 6 processors with Performance-cores (P-Cores) can support large AI workloads across diverse sectors. With industry-leading capabilities in AI processing, the Xeon 6 family delivers the industry\u2019s best CPU for AI at a lower total cost of ownership.Intel's innovative AI solutions are set to benefit the broader semiconductor ecosystem by driving down costs, improving performance and fostering an open, scalable AI environment. It remains on track with its 5N4Y (five nodes in four years) program to regain transistor performance and power performance leadership by 2025. Intel Xeon platforms have reportedly set the benchmark in 5G cloud-native core with substantial performance and power-efficiency improvements, additional power-saving capabilities and easy-to-deploy software. This has triggered healthy demand trends from major telecom equipment manufacturers and independent software vendors to optimize and unleash proven power savings for a more sustainable future.However, Intel derives a significant part of its revenues from China. As Washington tightens restrictions on high-tech exports to China, Beijing has intensified its push for self-sufficiency in critical industries. This shift poses a dual challenge for Intel, as it faces potential market restrictions and increased competition from domestic chipmakers. The company is also lagging behind in the GPU and AI front compared to peers such as NVIDIA andAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.AMD. Leading technology companies are reportedly piling up NVIDIA\u2019s GPUs to build clusters of computers for their AI work, leading to exponential revenue growth. NVIDIA is rapidly gaining traction in enterprise AI, expanding its market beyond cloud providers. Major companies across industries are integrating NVIDIA\u2019s AI platforms to automate workflows, enhance productivity and improve decision-making. The company\u2019s DGX Cloud AI infrastructure, which allows enterprises to train and deploy AI models at scale, has seen increased adoption. The expansion of CUDA software and AI frameworks strengthens NVIDIA\u2019s ecosystem, making it the preferred choice for enterprises developing AI applications. With AI adoption expected to accelerate in 2025 and beyond, NVIDIA\u2019s software and AI cloud solutions are a significant revenue driver.In addition, the generative AI revolution continues to be a tailwind for NVIDIA. The company\u2019s Hopper 200 and upcoming Blackwell GPUs are designed for training and inference of large language models, recommendation engines and generative AI applications. NVIDIA\u2019s Blackwell Ultra GPUs, set for launch later in 2025, are expected to deliver up to 25x the token throughput for AI inference compared to Hopper 100, further solidifying its dominance in AI-driven computing. Additionally, AI adoption is spreading beyond cloud hyperscalers, with industries such as healthcare, automotive and robotics increasingly investing in AI-powered solutions. This diversification ensures NVIDIA continues to grow beyond its traditional customer base.However, NVIDIA\u2019s reliance on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company for GPU production presents significant supply chain risks, particularly given the ongoing geopolitical tensions between China and Taiwan. Given the growing tension between the United States and China, further export restrictions on advanced AI chips could also limit NVIDIA\u2019s ability to sell high-end GPUs in key markets like China, potentially hurting revenue growth. Moreover, competition is intensifying with AMD\u2019s MI300 AI accelerators and Intel\u2019s Gaudi AI chips gaining traction, offering cost-effective alternatives for enterprises looking to diversify away from NVIDIA\u2019s high-priced GPUs. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Intel\u2019s 2025 sales implies a year-over-year decline of 4.3%, while that of EPS indicates growth of 323.1%. The EPS estimates have been trending southward on average over the past 60 days. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NVIDIA\u2019s 2025 sales suggests year-over-year growth of 51.4%, while that for EPS implies a rise of 42.1%. The EPS estimates have been trending southward over the past 60 days. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Over the past year, Intel has declined 31.1% against the\u00a0industry\u2019s growth of 17.6%. NVIDIA has gained 21.8% over the same period. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Intel looks more attractive than NVIDIA from a valuation standpoint. Going by the price/sales ratio, Intel\u2019s shares currently trade at 1.78 forward sales, significantly lower than 16.17 for NVIDIA.

You can seethe complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Both companies expect their earnings to improve in 2025. However, Intel expects a decline in revenues contrary to that of NVIDIA. Over the years, NVIDIA has shown a steep revenue and EPS growth, while Intel has been facing a bumpy road with a downhill slope. With a healthy long-term earnings growth expectation of 28.2%, NVIDIA is relatively better placed than Intel (long-term earnings growth expectations of 10.5%), although the former is a bit expensive in terms of valuation metrics. Consequently, NVIDIA seems to be a better investment option at the moment. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company recently outlined a compelling roadmap powered by technological leadership across interconnect standards, a factor that now stands as its core growth engine. Let us delve deeper. Astera Labs has built a first-mover advantage with a full stack of PCIe Gen 6 solutions, including retimers, smart gearboxes, optical modules and fabric switches, designed to meet the stringent performance and signal integrity demands of modern AI racks. At the same time, its Leo CXL product family addresses the growing need for memory expansion and pooling as data center CPUs adopt CXL 2.0 and 3.0, enabling support for both AI and general-purpose compute workloads. Looking ahead, Astera Labs is poised to further expand its market through emerging standards like UALink and NVLink Fusion. With UALink 1.0 introduced in early 2025, Astera Labs plans to commercialize solutions by 2026, opening the door to a scalable, open interconnect for AI accelerators and unlocking a multibillion-dollar opportunity. In parallel, the company\u2019s deepening collaboration withNVIDIANVDA integrates NVLink Fusion into its Intelligent Connectivity Platform, delivering low-latency, memory-coherent links for GPU clustering, essential for powering the next generation of LLMs and agentic AI models. Marvell Technology- Diversified Scale Meets AI Connectivity:Marvell TechnologyMRVL is a notable peer in data center interconnects, with strengths in custom ASICs, PAM4 DSPs and 800G optical solutions. While its broader focus spans 5G and enterprise storage, Marvell increasingly competes with Astera Labs in cloud-optimized Ethernet and silicon platforms. However, Astera Labs\u2019 tighter integration of hardware and software via the COSMOS suite gives it a unique edge in AI-specific system observability and fleet management, areas where Marvell remains less specialized. Broadcom-Scale Leader With Limited AI Rack Focus: BroadcomAVGO holds strong positions in PCIe switches, SerDes and networking silicon, serving all major hyperscalers. Yet, its offerings are typically component-level and less tailored for AI rack-scale deployments. Unlike Broadcom\u2019s broad-market strategy, Astera Labs focuses on delivering interoperable subsystems purpose-built for AI, giving it greater agility in addressing emerging infrastructure needs like UALink, CXL and NVLink-based clustering. Astera Labs has risen 26.2% in the past three months compared with the industry and the sector\u2019s 10.2% and 7.5% growth, respectively.\u00a0The S&P 500 index has improved 3.6% during the said period.

        "content": "UBS says humanoid robots could drive a 40% annual growth rate in the tech sector through 2050, bolstering demand for chips and hardware. UBS expects humanoid robots to become a major growth engine for the tech sector, with the global market potentially reaching 86 million units by 2050, up from 15,000 this year. The firm highlighted the semiconductor segment as a key driver of this expansion. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. UBS estimates the semiconductor market linked to humanoid robots could rise from $21 million in 2025 to $177 billion by 2050about 28% of the current industry size. The report, published in UBS's latest Q-Series, outlines that components such as processors, sensors, analog chips, and memory will be central to powering humanoid intelligence and functionality. UBS has built a projected bill of materials showing a high-end humanoid could carry about $1,400 worth of chips in 2025, increasing to $2,000 by 2050. This includes a $500 main processor and a range of components for storage, sensing, and motor control. Nvidia (NVDA,Financials), Qualcomm (QCOM,Financials), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM,Financials) were listed as chipmakers positioned to benefit from the trend. Hardware and component firms such as Sony (SONY,Financials) and Micron (MU,Financials) also feature among potential beneficiaries. Assembly-related players include Quanta Services (PWR,Financials). UBS believes artificial intelligence is accelerating the timeline for adoption, with humanoids potentially replacing manual labor in sectors like manufacturing, healthcare, and hospitality. UBS analysts, led by Randy Abrams, wrote that an inflection could pull in with AI to drive a tech product cycle, driven by high compute requirements. Nvidia's upcoming Thor platform for humanoid processing is cited as a near-term catalyst. Investors watching the space may look to hardware rollouts and AI training advances as signs of progress.

The company introduced the Instinct MI350 accelerator series and offered a preview of the MI400 lineup expected in 2026. AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) also revealed its new Helios AI server platform, which seeks to deliver a full-stack alternative to Nvidia\u2019s dominant infrastructure. The MI350 is positioned as a fourfold improvement over its predecessor, with AMD claiming it offers substantially better compute performance per dollar relative to Nvidia\u2019s Blackwell B200 GPU. The company is also pushing hard on open standards, and hopes to attract developers and hyperscalers who are increasingly wary of vendor lock-in. Key clients appear to be buying in, OpenAI, Meta, Microsoft, and Oracle were all named as early adopters. OpenAI\u2019s Sam Altman even joined AMD CEO Lisa Su onstage during the reveal, which might be a signal of strategic alignment at the highest level.

        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks --Apple,Amazon,Meta Platforms,Alphabet,Microsoft,Nvidia(NVDA0.33%), andTesla-- have all generated impressive returns for their long-term investors. All seven stocks are included in theS&P 500and Nasdaq-100 indexes, and they often drive the market's performance with their size, growth, and influence. But after years of big gains, most of the Magnificent Seven stocks are losing their luster. Apple is still overwhelmingly dependent on the iPhone, which is vulnerable to high tariffs, competition, and supply chain constraints. Amazon faces stiff competition from cheaper cross-border competitors, Alphabet's Google is being slammed by antitrust regulators and struggling to keep pace with OpenAI's ChatGPT and other generativeartificial intelligence (AI) services, and Microsoft might be headed for an ugly breakup with OpenAI as the AI start-up openly rebels against its top investor. As for Tesla, Elon Musk's divisive actions are likely driving away its potential customers in the saturated EV market. Image source: Getty Images. Meta and Nvidia face fewer near-term headwinds than the other five stocks. However, Meta generates nearly all of its revenue from ads, and its growth could slow down as the global economy cools off. Nvidia certainly isn't immune to economic downturns and recessions, but the secular expansion of its AI chipmaking business could offset a lot of that pressure. So looking ahead, I believe Nvidia will continue to shatter Wall Street's expectations and outperform the other Magnificent Seven stocks for the foreseeable future. Nvidia is the world's largest producer of discrete GPUs. It designs itsown chips, but it outsources its manufacturing to third-party foundries likeTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. With that \"fabless\" model, Nvidia doesn't need to spend billions of dollars to upgrade its own foundries or develop the smallest, densest, and most power-efficient manufacturing nodes. Nvidia once generated most of its revenue from its gaming GPUs, which can also be used to mine certain cryptocurrencies. But in its latest quarter, it generated less than 9% of its revenue from its gaming GPUs. A whopping 89% came from its data center GPUs -- which include its older A100 chips and current-gen H100 and H200 chips. Nvidia launched its first data center GPUs back in 2008. Unlike traditional CPUs, which only process a single piece of data at a time through scalar processing, GPUs use vector processing to process a broad range of integers and floating-point numbers simultaneously. That makes them better suited for processing complex AI tasks than stand-alone CPUs. Nvidia's sales of data center GPUs rose from 2016 to 2022 as the cloud and AI markets expanded, but they didn't explode until 2023 (fiscal 2024) -- when OpenAI's launch of ChatGPT in late 2022 sparked a global AI infrastructure race. Here's how rapidly that growth engine expanded from fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2025 (which ended this January). Metric FY 2022 FY 2023 FY 2024 FY 2025 Data center revenue growth 58% 41% 217% 142% Data center as percentage of total revenue 39% 56% 78% 88% Total revenue growth 61% 0% 126% 114% Data source: Nvidia. From fiscal 2025 to fiscal 2028, analysts expect Nvidia's revenue and earnings per share to grow at compound annual growth rates of 30% and 28%, respectively, as the AI market continues to expand. Its stock still looks reasonably valued relative to those estimates at 36 timesforward earnings. But those estimates could be too conservative -- since Nvidia has comfortably beat Wall Street's top- and bottom-line expectations for nine consecutive quarters. So as the top seller of the picks and shovels for the AI gold rush, Nvidia's revenues and profits should keep crushing analysts' expectations. Nvidia controls about 98% of the data center GPU market, according to TechInsights. It locks in those customers with its proprietary Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) programming platform. When developers write their AI applications on CUDA, they become optimized for Nvidia's GPUs and can only be executed on its chips. If they want to run that same application on another GPU, they need to be rewritten in other frameworks. That stickiness widens its moat againstAMDand other challengers. Nvidia's sales in China are being throttled by the U.S. export curbs, but it can easily offset that pressure with its stronger chip sales in other markets. It can also keep selling less powerful variants of its flagship chips (like its modified H20 chip) to its Chinese customers. Simply put, Nvidia has plenty of ways to keep growing. It's already had a great run over the past decade, but it has an easy path toward outperforming the market and its Magnificent Seven peers.",

        "content": "Est\u00e9e Lauder (EL) stock is turning heads. Shares of the cosmetics company were among the top performers of theS&P 500Monday after Deutsche Bank upgraded its rating of the stock to \"buy\" from \"hold\" and lifted its price target, saying a makeover of the firm's strategy appears promising. For years, Est\u00e9e Lauder belatedly reacted to trends and neglected key markets while over-concentrating on Chinese consumers, Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a research note Sunday. The company has gotten better at responding to what's in fashion by broadening its focus and decentralizing decision-making, they said. \"Clearly, growth at EL has lagged behind peers in recent years (exacerbated by undershipment to clear excess trade inventory),\" the note said. \"However, going forward, we see EL in a far better position to at least keep pace (if not surpass) market growth rates.\" Shares sank to below $50 in April from nearly $375 in January 2022, but Deutsche Bank thinks \"that many of the root causes of this decline have now been addressed\" and raised its price target to $95 from $71. The average price target among analysts who follow Est\u00e9e Lauder and were polled by Visible Alpha is about $68. Est\u00e9e Lauder stock, which entered Monday essentially flat for the year, was up 4% to roughly $78 in recent trading.",

Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. Nvidia reportedly booked all server manufacturing capacity at Wistron's recently launched facility in Zhubei, Taiwan, to produce its next-generation Blackwell and Rubin AI systems. The orders, which extend through 2026, reflect Nvidia's aggressive push to secure critical AI infrastructure capacity as demand continues to outstrip supply. The plant began operating this quarter and was officially inaugurated on June 19. Wistron's CEO confirmed at the event that contracts for AI server production already extend at least a year, whileEconomic DailyandCommercial Timesreported that Nvidia has effectively locked in all future output. Wistron's collective operations produce an estimated 240,000 Blackwell-based systems per quarter, and the company has warned that its capacity may not be able to meet future demand by 2026. To address this, Wistron has secured an adjacent buildingset to become a second AI server site next yearto double its Taiwan-based output. AI server shipments have become a primary growth engine not only for Wistron but also for Quanta and Foxconn. Wistron is simultaneously expanding its U.S. presence with a new facility near Dallas, Texas. By reserving full production at Wistron's Zhubei plant, Nvidia is ensuring that its cloud and system partners receive AI servers in required quantities while competitors face tighter supply constraints. Nvidia's control of the CoWoS supply chain and now server assembly capacity signals its strategic intent to dominate the AI hardware ecosystem. This article first appeared onGuruFocus.",

        "header": "What To Expect For Retirement Savings in the Second Half of 2025",
        "content": "Retirement savers have weathered a tumultuous first half of the year, and there may be more to come. The first half of the year brought with it some major highs and lows that gave many investors whiplash. The average 401(k) and IRA balances ended thefirst quarter down, mostly due to market swings. And while thestock market has broadly bounced backso far in the second quarter, lingering concerns about inflation and the cost of living may have led to fewer people contributing to or prioritizing their retirement savings, experts said. At the same time, interest rates on all kinds of loans remain elevated. The Federal Reserve has committed to waiting to see how President Donald Trump's tariffs affect the economybefore it cuts its influential benchmark rate. While that's bad news for car notes, credit cards and personal loans, it could be good news for savers looking to make money off their cash. Because much of the uncertainty from the first half of the year has yet to be resolved, experts expect more volatility in the second half of the year. For example, Trump has set an early July deadline fordozens of trade deals to be completed. If higher tariffs result, it could once again roil financial markets. \u201cIt's not a matter of if there will be more market volatility, but a matter of when,\u201d said Kourtney Gibson, CEO of TIAA Retirement Solutions. This is important because conventional investing advice recommends 60% of a portfolio be put toward equities and 40% toward bonds. However, retirement savers should consider risk tolerance and individual goals, experts said. \u201cWhile I don't have a crystal ball to predict how markets might perform the remainder of the year, it's precisely moments like these when having a long-term versus a reactive investment plan is most crucial,\" Gibson said. Last week, Federal Reserve officialsheld their influential fed funds rateat a higher-than-normal level for the fourth straight meeting. Experts expect it to stay there, at least until the fall, if not all year long. While that can be a drag on borrowers, it can be a boon for savers. TheFed's key interest rateinfluences what banks and credit unions offer customers on accounts such as high-yield savings, money market, and certificates of deposit (CDs). Retirement savers can lock in ahigher-than-typical interest rateon CDs for anywhere from3 monthsto5 years. They can also stash their cash in ahigh-yield savings account, but that interest rate could change iftariffs cause job lossesand theFed decides to cut its rate this year. Despite the predicted volatility, advisors recommend staying the course with retirement savings. Those who pull out their money prematurely will likely impact their savings more than those who stay the course and experience some initial losses, they said. \u201cTime in the market, more than timing markets, has generally been the most reliable path for investors who are saving for retirement,\u201d said Rob Williams, managing director of financial planning, retirement income, and wealth management at Charles Schwab. To feel more secure in staying the course, advisors suggested ensuring savers have a retirement plan that involves preparing for and acknowledging risks, like inflation, interest rates and market volatility. Retirement savers also need to prepare for the potential of a longer life (and needing more saved in retirement as a result), said Gibson. \u201cImplementing lifetime income solutions (like annuities or other guaranteed income products) that are part of a comprehensive retirement strategy is so important, particularly before any future volatility hits,\u201d she said. Another smart retirement planning decision for the future includes tapping into the full range of tax-advantaged investment accounts, like IRAs, 401(k)s, Health Savings Accounts (HSAs), and Roth accounts, especially if you aren\u2019t already. These help to reduce, defer, or eliminate taxes you\u2019d otherwise be on the hook for.",

        "content": "Hims & Hers Health (HIMS) shares tumbled nearly 35% Monday after Novo Nordisk (NVO) said it is pulling out of its partnership with the digital pharmacy, citing \"illegal\" and \"deceptive\" practices. That means the Danish drugmaker's weight-loss drug Wegovy will no longer be available through the Hims & Hers platform, less than two months after the companiesannounced their collaborationin late April. In a Monday press release, Novo Nordisk alleged that Hims & Hers \"has failed to adhere to the law which prohibits mass sales of compounded drugs under the false guise of 'personalization' and are disseminating deceptive marketing that put patient safety at risk.\" \"We will work with telehealth companies to provide direct access to Wegovy\u00a0that share our commitment to patient safety\u2014and when companies engage in illegal sham compounding that jeopardizes the health of Americans, we will continue to take action,\" Executive Vice President of Novo Nordisk's U.S. Operations Dave Moore said. In a social media post Monday, Hims & Hers co-founder and CEO Andrew Dudum said in response that the company was \"disappointed to see Novo Nordisk management misleading the public.\" \"In recent weeks, Novo Nordisk\u2019s commercial team increasingly pressured us to control clinical standards and steer patients to Wegovy regardless of whether it was clinically best for patients,\" Dudum said. \"We refuse to be strong-armed by any pharmaceutical company\u2019s anticompetitive demands that infringe on the independent decision making of providers and limit patient choice.\" Wegovy and Ozempic, along with rival Eli Lilly's (LLY) Mounjaro and Zepbound, were in a shortage for much of the last two years, with aFood and Drug Administrationpolicy allowingcompounding pharmacies to make and sellversions of the drugs based on the same active ingredient while they were in short supply. However, when the FDA said earlier this year that Ozempic and Wegovy wereno longer in a shortage, it warned compounding pharmacies had until mid-May before the agency would pursue enforcement actions. Novo Nordisk shares lost close to 6% Monday, with the drugmaker also facingdisappointing new trial results.

        "content": "Novo Nordisk's (NVO) U.S.-listed shares fell close to 6% Monday after the drugmaker revealed the results of aPhase 3 trialfor a new weight-loss treatment. The maker of Ozempic and Wegovy said that after a 68-week trial, obese and overweight patients who took CagriSema and followed a treatment plan lost an average of 22.7% of their body weight compared to 2.3% for those in the placebo group. About 40% of the group lost at least 25% of their body weight during the trial, and nearly a quarter lost 30% or more. Just 6% of the trial group stopped taking the drug, mainly due to gastrointestinal issues like nausea and constipation. Novo Nordisk also published results from a second trial Monday, evaluating the drug's effectiveness among overweight or obese patients with type 2 diabetes. At 68 weeks, the average weight loss was about 15.7% of a patient's body weight, and the company said the second trial had similar safety results as the first. Previous trial resultsfor the drug weighed on Novo Nordisk's shares, as CagriSema has yet to achieve the average weight loss of 25% that thecompany has reportedly hoped for. Shares have also been pressured by trials showing thatrival Eli Lilly's(LLY) Mounjaro and Zepbound, along with its drugs in development, are more effective at causing weight loss than Ozempic and Wegovy. U.S.-listed shares of Novo Nordisk are down nearly 20% since the start of 2025 and have lost half their value over the past 12 months. Separately, Novo Nordisk said it has ended its partnership with digital pharmacy Hims & Hers Health (HIMS), and will no longer allow the company to prescribe Wegovy. The companiesannounced the collaboration in April, but on Monday Novo Nordisk accused Hims of \"illegal mass compounding and deceptive marketing.\"Hims & Hers shares plummeted nearly 35% Monday.
