But Where? The South Korean tech leader is making a $10 million investment in Skild, which develops software for robots, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The Santa Clara, California chipmaker is putting in $25 million, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing unannounced plans. The financing is part of the company\u2019s Series B funding round, which will value the company at around $4.5 billion and is led by a $100 million investment from Japan\u2019s SoftBank Group Corp. Internally, Samsung views its Skild investment as a way to keep visibility into the startup and its talent without needing to make a significant commitment. Another reason: to keep pace with other South Korean conglomerates like LG, Hanwha and Mirae Asset, which all have divisions putting between $5 million to $10 million into Skild. Nvidia has begun to push the idea of \u201cphysical AI\u201d \u2014 meaning robots and autonomous vehicles \u2014 becoming a significant future revenue driver as the technology matures. The chipmaker has semiconductors, software and services aimed at speeding up the deployment of robots that can think for themselves. Samsung considers some aspects of Skild\u2019s solutions inferior to others in the market, said some of the people. Representatives for Samsung and Nvidia declined to comment. A representative for Skild didn\u2019t respond to an inquiry. Robotics are quickly becoming a major area of future growth for the world\u2019s technology companies, with Apple Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google all investing heavily in the space. Tesla Inc., meanwhile, has long been preparing to ship its Optimus robot. A few months ago, Samsung took a minority stake in Physical Intelligence, which also develops underlying robotics algorithms, with a small investment. The startup has already raised around $400 million and was last valued at about $2.4 billion. Nvidia has invested in companies like Figure AI and Serve Robotics. Samsung already sells robot vacuums, but its ambitions go deeper to include humanoid robots and other household appliances. Later this year, in partnership will Google, it will launch the Ballie, a soccer-ball-sized machine that can project video onto walls. Samsung is also the largest shareholder of Rainbow Robotics, which makes humanoids. That company sits at the center of its work in the field. --With assistance from Ian King, Kate Clark and Yoolim Lee.

        "content": "For the last two and a half years, no trend has captivated more attention or capital from investors thanartificial intelligence (AI). With AI, software and systems are capable of making split-second decisions without the need for human intervention. This is a technology with seemingly limitless long-term potential. With AI offering some form of utility in virtually all industries around the globe, the analysts at PwC pegged its worldwide impact on gross domestic product by 2030 at $15.7 trillion. A figure this massive ensures there will be a long list of winners. No company has been a more direct beneficiary of the evolution of AI thanNvidia(NVDA0.22%), whose market cap skyrocketed by more than $3 trillion in less than two years. But what's interesting is how Wall Street's most prominent billionaire money managers have approached Nvidia stock. Specifically,billionaire investors have been selling shares of Nvidiahand over fist... with one notable exception. Image source: Getty Images. No later than 45 calendar days following the end to a quarter, institutional investors overseeing at least $100 million in assets are required to fileForm 13Fwith the Securities and Exchange Commission. This filing details for investors which stocks Wall Street's smartest money managers were buying and selling in the latest quarter. Whereas most billionaires have been persistent sellers of Nvidia stock (a topic I'll touch on a bit later), Tiger Global Management's billionaire chief Chase Coleman has been the exception. Accounting for Nvidia's historic 10-for-1 forward split that was enacted in June 2024,Coleman's fund has expanded its stake in the companyfrom 9,683,550 shares, at the end of 2023, to 10,967,550 shares, as of the end of March 2025. Coleman's investment strategy has historically focused on a mix of large- and small-cap growth stocks, with a tendency to lean into next-big-thing trends and innovations. The rise of artificial intelligence certainly fits the mold of a game-changing trend that would interest Tiger Global's billionaire investor. Chase Coleman choosing to expand his fund's exposure to Nvidia likely has to do with one or more of the following four factors. First,Nvidia's share of the graphics processing unit (GPU) marketin high-compute data centers can be described as monopoly like. Businesses have lined up to purchase Nvidia's Hopper (H100) and successor Blackwell GPUs, and there's been no evidence that demand for these products has slowed. Wall Street tends to reward companies with perceived-to-be sustainable moats. Secondly, AI-GPU scarcity has been working in Nvidia's favor. Even with Wall Street's AI darling and other direct competitors pushing out as many GPUs as possible, the chip fabrication supply chain is currently maxed out. With demand heavily outpacing the supply of AI-GPUs, Nvidia has been able to charge a triple-digit percentage premium for Hopper and Blackwell, relative to some of its direct rivals. This helped to lift Nvidia's gross margin above 70%. The third factor that likely played a role in enticing Coleman to expand his fund's Nvidia stake is CEOJensen Huang's ambitious innovation timeline. Huang is overseeing the debut of a new advanced AI chip on an annual basis. Blackwell Ultra (second-half of 2025), Vera Rubin (second-half of 2026), and Vera Rubin Ultra (second-half of 2027) are next in line after the ultra-popular Blackwell chip. Nvidia looks to be in no danger of ceding its clear-cut compute advantages in AI-accelerated data centers. Fourth and finally, Nvidia stock tumbled at times during the first quarter, which may have brought itsforward-year earnings multipledown to a level that intrigued Coleman. Image source: Getty Images. However, Chase Coleman's actions are out of the ordinary among billionaire fund managers. Since Nvidia stock kicked off its historic run-up,most billionaires have pared down their exposure to the AI colossusor completely exited their respective positions: This persistent selling activity may well be explained by nothing more than simple profit-taking. We've never witnessed a megacap stock gain $3 trillion in market cap in less than two years before, which has offered plenty of opportunity for billionaires to cash in their chips. But there may be more to this consistent selling than just a desire to take profits. For example, competition is inevitable in AI-accelerated data centers. Even if Nvidia continues to be the preferred option in high-compute data centers, it's unlikely to retain its monopoly like market share as direct competitors ramp up their GPU production.  Growing competition looks to be weighing on Nvidia's superior gross margin.NVDA Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly)data byYCharts. What's potentially more worrisome is that most members of the \"Magnificent Seven\" areinternally developing AI chips to use in their data centers. While these GPUs are no threat to Nvidia's compute advantages, they are notably cheaper and not backlogged due to demand. The mere presence of these chips means less future opportunity for Nvidia's hardware, as well as less in the way of premium pricing power. There's also the very real possibility ofJensen Huang's accelerated innovation timeline hurting, not, helping, his company. Though bringing a new chip to market annually will cement its compute advantage, it has the potential to quickly depreciate the value of prior-generation chips. Wagering on Nvidia's largest customers to upgrade their hardware on an annual or near-annual basis is risky and may not pay off. Perhaps the biggest concern for a majority of billionaire money managers selling Nvidia stock is the prospect of history rhyming. Every game-changing trend and innovation for more than three decadeshas endured an eventual bubble-bursting event early in its expansion. This is due to investors overestimating the mainstream adoption and/or utility of a new technology or innovation. Considering that most businesses aren't generating a positive return on their AI investments, nor have they optimized their AI solutions, it looks to be a matter of time before the AI bubble bursts. If history were to rhyme, no company would be expected to take it on the chin more than Nvidia.",

This included a pandemic, 40-year high inflation, and the recent tariff-driven sell-off in March. The stock market is the greatest wealth-creating machine the world has ever known. As the Nasdaq's superior return shows, the tech sector is historically the place to find the most innovative companies that are bringing about change. When you invest on the right side of change, you're positioning yourself to build wealth. Artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing are megatrends that are pointing to profitable opportunities for investors who choose the right stocks. If you're looking to put $50,000 to work, here are two AI leaders that would make solid holdings as part of awell-rounded portfolio. Image source: Getty Images. After rocketing in 2023 and 2024, shares ofNvidia(NVDA-0.85%)cooled off to start 2025. But spending onAIinfrastructure is still ramping up, making the recent lull in the share price a great time to invest in the AI chip leader ahead of more growth. Nvidia's recent quarterly earnings report showed that spending on AI infrastructure is continuing to grow rapidly. Despite taking a $4.5 billion charge for chip export restrictions to China, quarterly revenue surged 69% year over year to $44 billion. CEO Jensen Huang described global demand for his company's AI computing solutions as \"incredibly strong.\" Its new Blackwell platform is experiencing the fastest production ramp-up in the company's history, which drove a 73% year-over-year increase in data center revenue last quarter. There are several tech companies, including some of its customers, that are designing their own custom AI chips. But Nvidia's advantage is in building complete computing systems, including the interconnects that speed up data transfer among chips. The complexity of building these computing platforms gives Nvidia a competitive edge. AI is sweeping across every industry and geography, andNvidiais in a great position to benefit. It's highly profitable, generating $76 billion in trailing-12-month earnings on $148 billion of revenue. By the end of the decade, Huang expects his company to control a large share of the $1 trillion that will be spent annually on data centers. Image source: Getty Images. Shares ofMicrosoft(MSFT0.36%)are surging following its quarterly results. The software giant has redefined itself in the last 10 years as a topcloud services provider. This strategy has positioned it to capitalize on growing demand for AI services in the cloud. Revenue from Microsoft Cloud grew 22% year over year on a constant-currency basis to $42 billion last quarter. Its Azure cloud enterprise service saw accelerating growth, as businesses are rushing to adopt AI to reduce costs, increase productivity, and accelerate innovation. Microsoftsaw a massive uptick in the amount of data being processed for AI workloads. The number of tokens, or units of data processed for AI, increased to more than 100 trillion -- a fivefold jump over the year-ago quarter. Management said that it processed more than 50 trillion tokens in the month of April alone, indicating accelerating use of its services for model building and data analysis. There are more than 10,000 organizations using Microsoft's Azure AI Foundry service for building and deploying AI agents. Agentic AI is expected to see tremendous demand because it is smart enough to think through all the steps needed to solve a problem without a human prompt. Microsoft's AI foundry puts the company in a great position to capitalize on the budding demand for this incredible technology. The company earned $96 billion in trailing profit on $270 billion of revenue. It can afford to open more data centers around the world and deploy thousands of Nvidia Blackwell chips to meet demand for its services. This makes the stock a solid investment.",

        "content": "Nvidia(NVDA0.22%)stock has soared by 870% since the start of 2023, catapulting its market capitalization to a whopping $3.5 trillion. Demand continues to exceed supply for the company's graphics processing units (GPUs) for the data center, which are the most powerful chips in the world for developing artificial intelligence (AI) models. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says new AI reasoning models, which spend more time thinking to produce accurate responses, require up to 1,000 times more computing capacity than traditional large language models (LLMs). As a result, he thinks data center spending will reach $1 trillion per year by 2028 as companies race to meet that demand. Nvidia is gearing up for the strongest year in its history thanks to its latest GPU architectures, which offer more performance than anything else on the market right now. Nvidia stock is trading at around $142 as of this writing (June 10), but here's why I think it's on the way to $200 before year-end. Image source: Nvidia. Nvidia's Hopper architecture was at the foundation of its H100GPU, which was the top-selling AI data center chip in 2023 and for most of 2024. It was superseded late last year by the Blackwell architecture, with GPUs like the GB200 producing up to 40 times more performance than the H100 in specific configurations. This is ideal forinferenceworkloads, which is the process by whichAI modelsanalyze data to produce responses for the end user. Inference demand is soaring because of the reasoning models I mentioned, which includeOpenAI'sGPT-o3 and o4, Anthropic's Claude 4,Meta Platforms'Llama 4, DeepSeek's R2, and more. PreviousLLMswere great at generating one-shot responses that created a fast and convenient user experience, but they sometimes produced inaccurate information. Reasoning models refine their responses in the background before delivering them to the user, which takes longer and consumes significantly more tokens (words, punctuation, and symbols) -- between 100 and 1,000 times more, according to Jensen Huang. Therefore, it's possible Blackwell's 40-fold performance leap over Hopper still isn't enough for some reasoning models, which could lead to a sluggish user experience. Nvidia recently launched Blackwell Ultra, which offers a slightly better 50-fold improvement over Hopper, but developers will have to wait until next year for the next major jump in performance. That's because Nvidia will start shipping a lineup of GPUs based on its new Rubin architecture in 2026, which could be 3.3 times faster than Blackwell Ultra -- or around 165 times faster than Hopper. This constant chase for performance is why Huang thinks annual data center spending is heading toward $1 trillion in 2028, and the company with themost powerful chipsis likely to capture the most market share. Wall Street's consensus estimate (provided by Yahoo! Finance) suggests Nvidia could generate a record $200 billion inrevenueduring its fiscal year 2026 (which ends on Jan. 30, 2027). Based on the company's recent financial results, the data center segment will account for around 89% of that revenue, which is whyAIand GPU sales are the main focus for investors right now. Nvidia generated $3.19 inearnings per share(EPS) over the last four quarters, which places its stock at aprice-to-earnings (P/E) ratioof 46. That is comfortably below its 10-year average of 59.9, suggesting the stock might be undervalued right now. Plus, Wall Street expects Nvidia to deliver up to $4.27 in EPS during fiscal 2026, placing its stock at aforward P/E ratioof 33.4:  NVDA PE Ratiodata byYCharts That means Nvidia stock would have to climb by 38% over the next nine months just to maintain its current P/E ratio of 46, and it would have to soar by 79% to trade in line with its 10-year average P/E ratio of 59.9. That would place Nvidia stock somewhere between $196 and $254 in the early stages of 2026. However, the stock market is a forward-looking machine, so investors usually start pricing in future earnings ahead of time. That's why I predict Nvidia stock will surpass $200 before 2025 is over. If Jensen Huang provides a bullish update on next year's Rubin GPUs, Wall Street analysts might even raise their EPS estimates, which would be another upside catalyst for the stock. But no matter what happens in the remainder of this year, investors should stay focused on the long term, because if data center operators spend $1 trillion annually on AI infrastructure by 2028, as Huang expects, $200 might actually be a bargain for Nvidia stock when we look back on this moment in the future.",

        "content": "If you want to invest in artificial intelligence (AI), the good news is there are a lot of options for you to consider. But not all of them are safe. If you're a risk-averse investor or simply want exposure to AI without having to worry about your portfolio, there are some excellent stocks to consider that you can simply buy and forget about.Nvidia(NVDA-0.85%),Microsoft(MSFT0.36%), andAmazon(AMZN-2.06%)are big names in tech, and they can also benefit significantly from AI. Here's why investing in these three behemoths may be a great way to keep your risk low while still potentially setting yourself up for some great long-run returns. Image source: Getty Images. Chipmaker Nvidia is simply unstoppable. I don't think it will double or triple in value anytime soon given that its valuation is already fairly high at more than $3 trillion. But I still see it as being a solidgrowth stockto hang on to for both the short and long terms. The biggest risk facing the business today is a slowdown in AI spending. If that happens, its growth will take a hit, and investors may opt for other growth stocks instead. But that's already been happening. As of the end of last week, Nvidia's stock was up just 6% since the start of the year, and that return would have been worse if not for a recent rally. Investors have already begun to pivot to other hot AI stocks. What I like about the company are its incredibly high profit margins. Even though it took a $4.5 billion hit in its most recent quarter (ended April 27) due to U.S. export restrictions to China, its net income still totaled $18.8 billion and was nearly 43% of its top line, $44.1 billion. Nvidia looks to be an unshakable company. And while its valuation may seem high, trading at an estimated 33 times its expected future earnings (based on analyst expectations), it's still a slam-dunk buy given its dominance in the AI chip market. An even safer stock than Nvidia may be Microsoft. What's great about this business is that it's less dependent on just the AI market than Nvidia. It doesn't make chips, but it does have its AI Copilot, which enhances the company's existing software, including its popular office products. Microsoft has been a big name in tech for decades, and the company is looking to cash in on this new growth opportunity. One catalyst that may still be waiting in the wings is growth in its computer business as Copilot-powered personal computers and devices are now available and could appeal to consumers who want stronger machines. But with the economy being less than ideal right now, it may take some time before demand takes off. For now, however, Microsoft is still doing well, reporting 13% revenue growth in its most recent quarter (which ended March 31), with its top line hitting $70.1 billion and profits rising by 18% to $25.8 billion. Another diverse tech company that can benefit significantly from AI is Amazon. Its growth opportunities are so plentiful that I believeit will become more valuable than the stocks listed here. Not only is it making its own chips, but it is also investing heavily into AI data centers, chatbots, and even robotaxis via its Zoox subsidiary. And on top of all this, Amazon still has the most popular online marketplace in the world, which can benefit from AI helping people find which items they want to buy, and helping sellers develop effective marketing strategies. The company's net sales through the first three months of the year totaled $155.7 billion, which was an increase of 10% when excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Its already robust cloud business, Amazon Web Services, which drives the bulk of the company's operating profit, should benefit significantly from more AI-powered growth as more businesses store data in the cloud. Last quarter, the segment generated $11.5 billion in operating profit, accounting for 63% of the company's total. More growth in that area of its operations should result in even better profits in the future. Amazon's business is incredibly strong, and with its operations potentially getting even more diversified in the future, this is one of the safestAI stocksto own.",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Traders who hung on during this year\u2019s tariff-fueled rollercoaster ride in stocks are facing a conundrum: Bonds may offer more attractive returns in coming years, according to one widely tracked measure. Most Read from Bloomberg Shuttered NY College Has Alumni Fighting Over Its Future Trump\u2019s Military Parade Has Washington Bracing for Tanks and Weaponry NYC Renters Brace for Price Hikes After Broker-Fee Ban NY Long Island Rail Service Resumes After Grand Central Fire Do World\u2019s Fairs Still Matter? The equity risk premium, which investors use to determine the difference between expected returns on equities and US Treasuries, is hovering around its lowest point since 2002, data from Bloomberg Intelligence showed. That suggests stocks are more expensive relative to bonds than they have been for most of the last two decades, according to Bloomberg Intelligence strategists Gina Martin Adams and Michael Casper. Calculated by subtracting the S&P 500 Index\u2019s earnings yield from the 10-year Treasuries rate, the gauge helps investors decide where to allocate their cash. The case for owning equities becomes less compelling if bonds can earn nearly as much as stocks but with reduced risk. After the big recovery in stocks since April, the readout is fairly gloomy for equities: The S&P 500 has averaged a 12-month return of only 2.5% over the past three decades when the risk premium has stood around current levels, according to data compiled by investment research firm CFRA. That compares to an average annual return of 8.5% for the period. \u201cWhenever you see equity risk premium slump this much, it historically tells us that stocks are becoming less attractive,\u201d said Timothy Chubb, chief investment officer at Girard, a wealth advisory firm backed by Univest. \u201cAfter a massive rally over the past two months, this could take some air out of the recent rebound.\u201d With the S&P 500 within 2% of a record following a breathtaking surge from the edge of a bear market, investors are seeking fresh catalysts to justify buying stocks at current levels. While a brighter outlook on global trade, robust corporate earnings and resilient economic data have driven that rebound, those factors appear to be largely priced in. That may be a reason for the comparatively listless trading in equities of late. The S&P 500 hasn\u2019t seen a move exceeding 0.6% in either direction for 10 of the last 11 sessions through Wednesday \u2014 the longest such stretch since early December, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. \u201cWe know what the rules of the game are now for the trade war, and tariff optimism is no longer a floor for shares with things looking pricey again,\u201d said Scott Ladner, chief investment officer at Horizon Investment. Higher Yields Meanwhile, Treasury yields stand near their highest levels in decades. Worries over US fiscal spending are expected to keep borrowing costs high for the foreseeable future, though several months of weaker-than-expected inflation have bolstered the case for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. Not all periods with a negative or low equity risk premium have coincided with poor stock returns. The measure was negative for two long stretches in the post-World War II era, from October 1968 to October 1973, and from September 1980 to June 2002, BI data show. During the first stretch, stocks gained 1.1% annually, but they surged an annualized 10% in the latter. At the same time, worries over the US fiscal position have dented the appeal of Treasuries, especially longer-dated maturities.

        "header": "Prediction: 3 Stocks Berkshire Hathaway Will Add to Its Portfolio After Warren Buffett Steps Down as CEO",
        "content": "Next year,Berkshire Hathawaywill have a new CEO. Warren Buffett, who has been in charge for decades, is stepping down and Greg Abel will be taking over. It's a monumental shift for the business, and while there may not necessarily be drastic changes in the day-to-day operations, there could be some adjustments to Berkshire's holdings. There are three stocks that I think Abel should consider adding to Berkshire's portfolio once he takes over:Microsoft(MSFT0.36%),Enbridge(ENB0.76%), andNvidia(NVDA-0.85%). Here's why these stocks are great long-term investments and why they fit the Berkshire mold. Image source: Getty Images. Buffett distanced himself from Microsoftbecause of his close association with co-founder Bill Gates. But with Buffett no longer at the helm, it opens the path for Berkshire to create a position in Microsoft under Abel. Microsoft is the type of business that checks all the boxes for Berkshire. It has solid fundamentals, many growth opportunities, and a strong brand that is known all over the world, giving it a fantasticcompetitive moat. In the trailing 12 months, the software company generated more than $270 billion in revenue, amassing nearly $97 billion in profit along the way. Microsoft is a leading company in artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing, and its office software is a staple in many businesses around the world. This is an excellent stock for investors to own for the long haul, and I think it may just be a matter of time before it finds its way into Berkshire's holdings. With Abel being from Canada and having strong roots in Alberta, I think he'll be inclined to put his stamp on Berkshire. And what better way to do so than by opening up a position in a top oil and gas company from Canada -- Enbridge. Berkshire is no stranger to the sector and holds multiple stocks from there. Enbridge is known for its consistency and long-term dependability, which is why it also looks like a model Berkshire-type investment. This year, the company expects to meet or exceed its financial guidance, and if it does, it'll be the 20th consecutive year that Enbridge has done so. Few companies can generate that kind of consistency. And Buffett has always valued predictability and stability in businesses. The pipeline company generated revenue totaling just under 61 billion Canadian dollars over the trailing 12 months. And with Enbridge closing on multiple acquisitions in the U.S. within the past year few years, its financials could look even better in the future. Along with an attractive dividend that yields nearly 6%, this is a stock that can be ideal for any type of long-term investor. Enbridge is another stock I expect may be a staple in Berkshire's portfolio once Abel is at the helm. For years, iPhone makerApplehas been the top holding in Berkshire's portfolio. But the company has arguably been losing its luster due to a fumbled AI rollout and delaying key features on its latest phones. And it highlights much more than that: a lack of innovation. At the very least, it's lagging behind its key rivals. A changing of the guard may be overdue at Berkshire. While Buffett has long been a fan of Apple's business, Abel may see an opportunity to change that up. Investing in Nvidia is a move that could make much more sense. Even for people who are unfamiliar with AI, investors have come to know about Nvidia's dominance in the chip world, and I believe it now has the strong brand that Apple once did, which is synonymous with innovation. Nvidia has dominant market share in the AI chip market, and its fundamentals are incredible. Over the past four quarters, it has net a profit of $77 billion on revenue of nearly $149 billion. Given its impressive market position and huge profit margins, it seems unfathomable that the stock isn't in Berkshire's portfolio already. I can only assume that it's because Buffett may not want too much exposure to tech or that he's simply too unfamiliar with it. For Abel, however, this can be yet another opportunity for him to change up Berkshire's holdings with moregrowth-oriented businesses. While Apple may have performed well over the past decade, it may no longer make sense for it to be Berkshire's top holding. Nvidia could be a much better fit.",

        "header": "Could This High-Flying Artificial Intelligence Stock Be the Next Nvidia?",
        "content": "Nvidia(NVDA0.22%)is one of the most valuable companies in the world, with a market cap north of $3 trillion. It's a big name in artificial intelligence (AI) due to its high-powered chips, which are used in developing AI models and chatbots. They have proven to be essential for tech companies looking to capitalize on the latest AI trends and who don't want to fall behind their rivals. For investors, however, buying Nvidia may not seem as alluring anymore, given its high valuation. A more tantalizing option is to look at what may be thenextNvidia stock, which can have the potential to deliver significant returns. One stock that has been scorching hot this year and that may be able to benefit from the AI hype is a company that Nvidia has also invested in:CoreWeave(CRWV1.66%). Image source: Getty Images. CoreWeave went public back in March, and it has amassed gains of more than 300% since then, as of this week. But at a market cap of around $80 billion, it's still relatively modest in size, at least when compared to tech giants like Nvidia. What puts CoreWeave in the front and center of the AI revolution is that the company rents out GPU computing capacity. It gives customers access to Nvidia's chips and the resources and infrastructure they need to test and train AI models without having to make the costly infrastructure investments themselves. Its close ties with Nvidia give CoreWeave an advantage by providing customers with access to cutting-edge chips. That has resulted in some incredible growth for CoreWeave's business. During the first three months of 2025, CoreWeave's sales totaled $981.6 million, which was a 420% year-over-year increase from the $188.7 million it generated in the same period of 2024. That's an incredible rate of growth. CEO Michael Intrator said that \"demand for our platform is robust and accelerating as AI leaders seek the highly performant AI cloud infrastructure required for the most advanced applications.\" The problem is that with such a capital-intensive business, it's not going to be easy for CoreWeave to turn a profit. Amid all that recent growth, its net loss also jumped significantly -- from $129.2 million a year ago to $314.6 million this past quarter. Thetech company's operating expenses totaled more than $1 billion, and its interest costs were sizable at $263.8 million. There's plenty of growth here, but investors should look beyond just the top line, as there are some serious question marks about the company and its prospects for profitability and if staying out of the red can even be possible anytime soon. CoreWeave's incredible growth has made it a hot new AI stock to own. But that alone isn't going to make it the next Nvidia, as CoreWeave will also need to show a strong bottom line as well. Until that changes, this will be a risky investment, as a lot will depend on its growth rate and how strong it proves to be in future quarters. If there's a slowdown in the economy and tech companies scale back on AI-related spending, CoreWeave could be among the most vulnerable AI stocks to be holding, given its dependence on that strong growth. Although CoreWeave's stock is performing incredibly well in just its first few months as a public company, investors should temper expectations as this can be a highly volatile investment, even if you're bullish on AI's long-term growth. This is a stock that will primarily appeal to investors with a high risk tolerance, and it's not one I'd buy today as there are manycheaper AI companies to considerright now.",

        "header": "Prediction: Nvidia's Recent Unobtrusive Maneuver Could Signal a Big Growth Move Ahead.",
        "content": "Nvidia(NVDA-0.85%)has seen its earnings and share price soar over the past several years. This is as it built dominance in one of the world's most-watched hot technologies: artificial intelligence (AI). This tech player has become the leader in the area of AI chips, with its graphic processing units (GPUs) topping rivals in speed and general performance. The company offers a variety of other AI services too -- even building tools specifically for certain sectors, such as healthcare or the automobile industry. All this has made Nvidia a household name in the world of AI. Now, the questions investors often ask are: What will be Nvidia's next move? After the explosive growth of the past few years, will the pace now slow? We may answer those questions thanks to a clue from the company itself. Nvidia recently made an unobtrusive -- and what may even seem ordinary maneuver -- but my prediction is it could signal a big growth move ahead. Let's take a look. Image source: Getty Images. First, a quick look at what's happened so far. Nvidia surged onto the scene early in the AI boom with itsGPUs, and they rapidly emerged as the tool needed to power this revolution. As a result, Nvidia's revenue, which had gradually increased since the company's launch in the early 1990s, skyrocketed over just the past few years.  NVDA Revenue (Annual)data byYCharts Now here's what'sreallyimportant: Not only has revenue taken off, but Nvidia also is very profitable on sales, withgross marginconsistently topping 70% in recent quarters. (It dipped to 60% in the most recent quarter on a charge linked to export restrictions concerningthe Chinese market, but excluding this charge, gross margin met its above-70% target.) Nvidia hasn't reached this level of revenue by selling the same chip year after year -- the company has become an innovation powerhouse, updating its AI chips and/or architecture frequently, and as of its latest release, known as Blackwell, a few months ago, Nvidia says updates will come on an annual basis. It's already set out anagenda of annual releasesthrough 2028. On top of that, Nvidia has struck partnerships with major projects -- for instance, supplying chips tothe Stargate project-- has landed contracts around the world, and is investing in manufacturing in the U.S. So, Nvidia is firing on all cylinders, and this should help it to benefit as today's multibillion-dollar AI market reaches into the trillions, as analysts predict, in the years to come. And Nvidia's unobtrusive action -- one that didn't attract much attention -- in recent times suggests a major growth move could be around the corner. Late last month, the company filed a mixed-shelf registration with regulators, allowing it to raise capital through equity or debt at any point during the coming three years. Nvidia currently has about 24 billion common shares and zero preferred shares outstanding; it's authorized 80 billion common shares and 2 million preferred shares, suggesting it has plenty of room to launch future sales. The shelf registration allows Nvidia to quickly plan an offering during this time frame, making it easier to take advantage of favorable market conditions and get in on opportunities as they arise. That's clearly a positive point. The second big positive is this move suggests Nvidia aims to invest in the near future -- this could be in a variety of areas, from research and development to factory expansion or even potential acquisitions. This readiness to invest implies growth opportunities lie ahead, and Nvidia, with this flexibility to quickly raise cash, is well positioned to benefit from them. We've already seen evidence of Nvidia's focus on growth in recent times. For example, in April, the company announced investment in two U.S. factories for the eventual manufacturing of American-made supercomputers and says they should ramp up in 12 to 15 months. So, why is all of this important for investors? As I mentioned, one big concern has been about Nvidia's growth moving forward. But considering Nvidia's leadership in a market with strong growth forecasts, there's reason to be optimistic about the future. And my prediction is Nvidia's decision to initiate a mixed-shelf registration signals the company is ready to make a big growth move -- one that could pay off for this tech giant and investors over the long term.",

        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA,Financials) CEO Jensen Huang said Wednesdaythat quantum computing is at an inflection point,signaling a more optimistic stance toward the emerging technology. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. Speaking at the companys GTC Paris developer conference, Huang said quantum systems could soon be applied to solve complex problems across sectors like science, finance and medicine. We are within reach, he said, referring to practical applications in the next few years. Huang cited Nvidias own work on Cuda Q, a hybrid quantum-classical solution, as a key part of the companys push into quantum. He also acknowledged Europes growing role in the sector, referencing a recent meeting with French quantum startup Pasqal. The shift in tone comes after Huang previously downplayed near-term expectations, saying in 2023 that a 20-year timeline was more realistic. Those remarks had led to a decline in shares of companies like Rigetti (RGTI,Financials) and IonQ (IONQ,Financials), though both were up in U.S. premarket trading Monday following recent developments. IonQ, for example, acquired Oxford Ionics for $1.1 billion. The comments also follow Googles progress on error correction in quantum chips, announced last year with the rollout of its Willow processor. Investors may view Huangs revised stance as a sign that Nvidia could deepen its investment in quantum computing infrastructure and tools.

Huang noted that self-driving cars are becoming more common in the U.S. and China, while Europe still faces regulatory hurdles for widespread deployment. He highlighted Nvidia's dual role supplying both processors and software platforms for autonomous systems. The chipmaker is positioning its technology to power next-generation robotics across industries such as manufacturing, logistics and transportation. Huang described physical AI as a major growth area, where intelligent machines act independently using Nvidia's compute architecture. Investors may focus on whether these long-term bets translate into near-term revenue gains. While demand for AI chips remains strong, geopolitical tensions and regulatory shifts could affect rollout timelines. Analysts remain optimistic on Nvidia's market position but caution that stock volatility may persist amid wider economic headwinds. This article first appeared onGuruFocus.",

        "content": "NVIDIArecently announced various initiatives, such as plans to take minority stakes in Skild AI with Samsung and partnerships to enhance AI systems, which may relate to its 24% price increase over the last quarter. The company's M&A rumors, investment in AI and quantum computing, and growing strategic alliances likely added momentum to its share price. Broad market trends, including rising tech stocks and overall market optimism, also supported NVIDIA's upward trajectory, though Oracle's strong performance might have drawn some comparative attention. Nevertheless, NVIDIA remained aligned with broader tech-sector gains. You should learn about the 1 risk we've spotted with NVIDIA. Find companies with promising cash flow potential yet trading below their fair value. NVIDIA's recent initiatives, including minority stakes in Skild AI and strategic partnerships to enhance AI systems, could strengthen its position in AI markets. These efforts, aligned with momentum from its Blackwell architecture and expanded AI presence in the automotive sector, indicate potential growth in both data center and automotive revenues. The partnerships with Toyota and Uber could particularly boost NVIDIA's footprint in autonomous vehicles, adding new revenue streams. Over the past five years, NVIDIA's total return of a very large percent, including dividends, indicates significant value creation for shareholders, contrasting sharply with broader market movements. Notably, over the past year, NVIDIA outperformed its sector, outpacing the US Semiconductor industry's 8.3% return and surpassing the wider market's 11.2% return. This performance reflects the company's readiness to leverage key technological trends effectively. Furthermore, ongoing AI development and the rollout of new GPU products could enhance revenue and earnings forecasts, though U.S. regulatory challenges and China export controls remain potential obstacles. Analysts anticipate NVIDIA's revenues to grow significantly above US$288.5 billion by 2028, driving a PE ratio closer to the forecast 31.9x level. Given the current share price of US$113.54, it sits at a significant discount to the average analyst price target of US$163.12, suggesting room for potential appreciation if growth projections are realized.

        "header": "AMD unveils AI server as OpenAI taps its newest chips",
        "content": "By Max A. Cherney and Stephen Nellis SAN JOSE (Reuters) -Advanced Micro Devices CEO Lisa Su on Thursday unveiled a new artificial intelligence server for 2026 that aims to challenge Nvidia's flagship offerings as OpenAI's CEO said the ChatGPT creator would adopt AMD's latest chips. Su took the stage at a developer conference in San Jose, California, called \"Advancing AI\" to discuss the MI350 series and MI400 series AI chips that she said would compete with Nvidia's Blackwell line of processors The MI400 series of chips will be the basis of a new server called \"Helios\" that AMD plans to release next year. The move comes as the competition between Nvidia and other AI chip firms has shifted away from selling individual chips to selling servers packed with scores or even hundreds of processors, woven together with networking chips from the same company. The AMD Helios servers will have 72 of AMD's MI400 series chips, making them comparable to Nvidia's current NVL72 servers, AMD executives said. During its keynote presentation, AMD said that many aspects of the Helios servers - such as the networking standards - would be made openly available and shared with competitors such as Intel. The move was a direct swipe at market leader Nvidia, which uses proprietary technology called NVLink to string together its chips but has recently started to license that technology as pressure mounts from rivals. \"The future of AI is not going to be built by any one company or in a closed ecosystem. It's going to be shaped by open collaboration across the industry,\" Su said. Su was joined onstage by OpenAI's Sam Altman. The ChatGPT creator is working with AMD on the firm's MI450 chips to improve their design for AI work. \"Our infrastructure ramp-up over the last year, and what we're looking at over the next year, have just been a crazy, crazy thing to watch,\" Altman said. During her speech, executives from Elon Musk-owned xAI, Meta Platforms and Oracle took to the stage to discuss their respective uses of AMD processors. Crusoe, a cloud provider that specializes in AI, told Reuters it is planning to buy $400 million of AMD's new chips. AMD's Su reiterated the company's product plans for the next year, which will roughly match the annual release schedule that Nvidia began with its Blackwell chips. AMD shares ended 2.2% lower after the company's announcement. Kinngai Chan, an analyst at Summit Insights, said the chips announced on Thursday were not likely to immediately change AMD's competitive position. AMD has struggled to siphon off a portion of the quickly growing market for AI chips from the dominant Nvidia. But the company has made a concerted effort to improve its software and produce a line of chips that rival Nvidia's performance. AMD completed the acquisition of server builder ZT Systems in March. As a result, AMD is expected to launch new complete AI systems, similar to several of the server-rack-sized products Nvidia produces. Santa Clara, California-based AMD has made a series of small acquisitions in recent weeks and has added talent to its chip design and AI software teams. At the event, Su said the company has made 25 strategic investments in the past year that were related to the company's AI plans. Last week, AMD hired the team from chip startup Untether AI. On Wednesday, AMD said it had hired several employees from generative AI startup Lamini, including the co-founder and CEO. AMD's software called ROCm has struggled to gain traction against Nvidia's CUDA, which is seen by some industry insiders as a key part of protecting the company's dominance. When AMD reported earnings in May, Su said that despite increasingly aggressive curbs on AI chip exports to China, AMD still expected strong double-digit growth from AI chips. (Reporting by Max A.

        "content": "AMD (AMD) launched its MI350 line of AI chips and detailed its next-generation MI400 line of GPUs as part of its Advancing AI event in San Jose, Calif., on Thursday. The company also unveiled its AMD Developer Cloud, which gives developers access to the company's AI processors via its cloud computing infrastructure. The MI350 line includes both the MI350X and MI355X and is designed to go head-to-head with Nvidia's (NVDA) Blackwell line of AI chips. AMD says the processors offer up to four times the AI compute performance and a 35x increase in inferencing capabilities versus its prior-generation MI350 chips. Each chip offers 288GB of HBM3E memory, more than the 192GB of memory found in Nvidia's Blackwell GPU. But Nvidia pairs two Blackwell GPUs in its GB200 superchip, meaning it actually comes with 384GB of memory. AMD said users can opt for either individual MI350x and MI355X chips or its MI350X and MI355X platforms, which combine 8 GPUs each for up to 2.3TB of memory. MI350 systems with up to 64 GPUs can be air cooled, meaning they'll use fans to keep from burning up, while MI350 systems of 128 GPUs can use liquid cooling, which involves running a coolant through a series of pipes and radiators to cool the chips. In addition to the MI350 launch, AMD revealed more information about its MI400 line of chips, which it said will launch in 2026. According to the company, the GPUs will feature up to 432GB of HBM4 and memory speeds of up to 19.6TB per second. Those chips will compete with Nvidia's GB300 Blackwell Ultra processors and its upcoming Rubin AI GPU. AMD also showed off its new AMD Developer Cloud. The service will allow users to log into AMD's platform to quickly gain cloud access to its line of MI300 and MI350 GPUs. The option gives developers who need to use high-powered chips for AI training and inferencing the ability to take advantage of the hardware without having to purchase it themselves. Nvidia launched a similar service called Nvidia DGX Cloud Lepton last month. AMD's stock has struggled over the past year, falling roughly 24% in the past 12 months. Nvidia's stock rose more than 19% in the same period. Year to date, AMD is off 0.2%, while Nvidia is up 7%. AMD, like Nvidia, was stung by write-downs related to the Trump administration's export controls on AI chips destined for China. The company says it expects to take an $800 million hit from the ban. Nvidia, meanwhile, was forced towrite down $4.5 billion due to the controlsand said it expects to miss out on $8 billion in sales in its fiscal second quarter.

        "content": "By Juby Babu (Reuters) -Nvidia will no longer include the China market in its revenue and profit forecasts following stringent U.S. trade restrictions on chip sales to the region, CEO Jensen Huang told CNN on Thursday. When asked if the United States would lift the export controls after the trade discussions with China in London this week, Huang said he was not counting on it. \"But, if it happens, then it will be a great bonus. I've told all of our investors and shareholders that, going forward, our forecasts will not include the China market,\" he said. Huang reiterated his criticism of U.S. chip export curbs during his CNN interview, building on his earlier remarks about the restrictions from April that prevented Nvidia from selling its H20 chip made for China. \"The goals of the export controls are not being achieved,\" he said. \"And so I think, with all export controls, the goals have to be well-articulated and tested over time.\" \"Beyond next quarter, if Nvidia is not able to resume sales into China, we believe there may be some downside to expectations for calendar year 2026,\" said D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria. Nvidia was still evaluating its \"limited options for the China market\", it said on Thursday. \"Until we settle on a new product design and receive approval from the U.S. government, we are effectively foreclosed from China's $50 billion data center market,\" the company said. The export limits cost it $2.5 billion in sales during the first quarter and it expects an $8 billion sales hit in the second quarter. \"By zero-basing China, Nvidia removes a volatile variable that neither Wall Street nor the Commerce Department can reliably handicap,\" said Michael Ashley Schulman, CIO of Running Point Capital, adding that any China sales would come as an upside surprise. The company reported $4.6 billion in first-quarter revenue from H20 sales as customers stockpiled the chips before the export controls set in, with the China business accounting for 12.5% of overall revenue.

        "content": "By Max A. Cherney SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -Crusoe CEO Chase Lochmiller said on Thursday theartificial intelligencedata center builder planned to purchase roughly $400 million worth of AI chips from Advanced Micro Devices to add to its portfolio of computing power. The cloud computing startup is aiming to build a data center - or cluster - to house the AMD AI chips in the U.S. and will rent them to customers for building AI models and running applications. Crusoe plans to purchase roughly 13,000 MI355X chips and use a liquid cooling system. The chips will be housed in a single facility that will come online in the fall that can be divvied up to several customers, or a single customer if there is one that wants to use the entire cluster, Lochmiller told Reuters in an interview. Crusoe's data centers are purpose-built to house AI chips, which it says allows it to offer superior performance compared with older designs. The company has developed pre-fabricated components to speed data center construction, similar to how pre-fabricated homes reduce construction time. \"Where startups lack in scale and people and capital, compared to some of the hyperscalers, where we can compete is actually being nimble, fast and have a high density of engineering talent,\" Lochmiller said. AMD's AI chips offer an alternative to the hardware sold by Nvidia, which has dominated the market. The AMD MI355X chips Crusoe plans to purchase include a large amount of high-bandwidth memory, which makes them well suited for running AI applications, which is known as inference. Crusoe is among a crop of companies that are building cloud computing services specifically for AI companies, usually by amassing large numbers of Nvidia chips. Nvidia has armed this group of newer companies with AI chips, in part, because it allows them to diversify its revenue away from cloud computing giants such asMicrosoft. Now, AMD is attempting to execute a similar plan. \"I think it's reaffirming of the neocloud strategy,\" Lochmiller said. \"These new platforms have a lot of value to add to the ecosystem by providing infrastructure to big users of AI,\" Lochmiller said.

Why is his buoyancy about quantum computing worth noting, and should investors think about buyingD-Wave Quantum Inc. QBTS andIonQ, Inc.IONQ stocks? Let\u2019s see \u2013 On Wednesday, Jensen Huang said, \u201cquantum computing is reaching an inflection point\u201d. He sounded more bullish about the future of quantum computing and expects the new technology to address real-world issues in the near term. Huang is impressed with the quantum computing industry and highlighted NVIDIA\u2019s chip support. He added that NVIDIA would accelerate its quantum algorithm stack on the Grace Blackwell 200 chip (read more: Is NVIDIA's Rise in Value a Sign to Invest in NVDA Stock?). Huang\u2019s recent positive comments on quantum computing were well received, especially after his earlier pessimistic prediction of a 15 to 20-year timeline for realizing the full impact of quantum computing. Quantum computing employs \u201cqubits\u201d to handle substantial amounts of data across disciplines such as science, medicine and finance. Quantum computing is an emerging field that harnesses quantum mechanics for efficient problem-solving, with McKinsey predicting a $2 trillion market growth by 2035. The growth will be mainly fueled by quantum computing applications in pharmaceutical and material science advancements. Quantum computing stocks have been gaining this year, withDefiance Quantum ETFQTUM advancing 9.9% this year, outperforming the S&P 500\u2019s 1.1% gain. In reality, Huang\u2019s bullish comments about the emerging technology helped shares of some quantum computing stocks soar to their highest level on Wednesday. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Investors are attracted to Huang's optimistic view on quantum computing and its rising popularity. However, quantum computing is still in its nascent stages; therefore, investing in related stocks requires careful consideration. We recommend two enticing stock picks for special attention. First on the list is D-Wave Quantum. The company posted blowout first-quarter results, with revenues coming in at $15 million, up a staggering 509% year over year. D-Wave Quantum was able to sell its cutting-edge Advantage2 quantum system to the J\u00fclich Supercomputer Center in Germany. The company ended the quarter with $304.3 million in cash, which means the company is well-funded to bear its operational costs. D-Wave Quantum met customer obligations and reduced liabilities by excelling in real-world applications due to its quantum annealing approach over gate-based computing. Interest in D-Wave\u2019s technology has helped the company expand its customer base, which includes the likes ofLockheed Martin CorporationLMT (read more: Here's Why D-Wave Stock Promises High Growth and Is a Buy). The second is IonQ. The company\u2019s ion trap architecture offers scalability and a competitive advantage, which may help it reach profitability soon. In the first quarter, IonQ reduced its non-GAAP loss per share to $0.14 from $0.19 a year earlier. Most importantly, the company has posted revenues of $7.6 million in the quarter and expects 2025 revenues of $75-$95 million after acquiring Lightsynq. Its latest acquisition of UK-based quantum computing firm Oxford Ionics has also bolstered its business position. IonQ\u2019s unique linear ion chains enable it to surpass 100 qubits, expand its customer base, and reduce errors in quantum computing compared to its competitors (read more: Is IonQ a Better Quantum Computing Stock to Buy Than D-Wave?).

Speaking at the Founders Forum Global in Oxford, Haas said that forcing China to build alternative ecosystems doesn't just isolate themit shrinks the market opportunity for everyone. It makes the pie smaller, he said, adding that Arm's own exposure to China is quite significant. His view echoes recent remarks from Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang, who has been increasingly vocal about the consequences of these export bans. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with ARM. Nvidia is already seeing the fallout. The company expects to lose around $8 billion in Chinese revenue this quarter alone after the U.S. tightened curbs on data center chip exports. Huang said in an April interview that Chinese AI firms are stepping in fast to fill the gap. The Chinese competitors have evolved, he noted, calling Huawei a formidable player. With Nvidia no longer selling its top AI chips to China, homegrown rivals are gaining momentum. While Arm and Nvidia once explored a merger, they now compete head-to-head in high-performance computing, with Arm claiming a unique edge across both large-scale data centers and low-power edge devices like earbuds. Despite the escalating rhetoric, there may be a thaw underway. Washington and Beijing just concluded a new round of trade negotiations, and Donald Trump declared a deal was DONE to restore rare metal exports from China. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick added that some tech curbs could be rolled back in return. Behind the scenes, Haas said his time in Washington has surged in the past 18 months, as Arm works to ensure policymakers understand what's at stake. The current administration has a lot of smart people connected to our industry, he said, signaling a willingness to engagebut also a growing urgency to shift course.

The move comes as investors continue to digest the news thatNvidiais collaborating with Navitas to develop data center architecture for the next generation of data centers, due to launch in 2027. There's no doubt that the Nvidia connection is fueling the stock price appreciation this year. However, there is still a long way to go before Navitas develops solutions to work in next-generation 800-volt (V) high-voltage direct current (HVDC) data centers being developed to handle the surge in demand from artificial intelligence (AI) applications and high-performance computing. For the sake of brevity, it's challenging to go into too much detail on them here. Suffice to note that Nvidia believes they will be 5% more efficient and cut maintenance costs by 70%, while lowering cooling costs. Navitas CEO Gene Sheridan discussed the matter this week at a Rosenblatt Securities Summit and said that the power efficiency of older 12V data centers using silicon technology was about 70%, with newer 48V data centers using gallium nitride and silicon carbide (Navitas' focus) the efficiency went  up into the 80s, but with the new 800V data centers it can get into the 90s. They may sound like small gains, but they are a significant reduction in costs and power requirements. Image source: Getty Images. That would be a significant plus and help support Sheridan's belief that Navitas' total addressable market stands at \"hundreds of millions of dollars headed to $1 billion over the coming years.\" It's that kind of potential that's encouraging speculative investors into the stock this week.",

        "content": "Investing.com -- Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) made an aggressive bid for dominance in AI inference at its Advancing AI event Thursday, unveiling new chips that directly challenge NVIDIA Corporation\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) supremacy in the data center GPU market. AMD claims its latest Instinct MI355X accelerators surpass Nvidia\u2019s most advanced Blackwell GPUs in inference performance while offering a significant cost advantage, a critical selling point as hyperscalers look to scale generative AI services affordably. The MI355X, which has just begun volume shipments, delivers a 35-fold generational leap in inference performance and, according to AMD, up to 40% more tokens-per-dollar compared to Nvidia\u2019s flagship chips. That performance boost, coupled with lower power consumption, is designed to help AMD undercut Nvidia\u2019s offerings in total cost of ownership at a time when major AI customers are re-evaluating procurement strategies. \u201cWhat has really changed is the demand for inference has grown significantly,\u201d AMD CEO Lisa Su said at the event in San Jose. \u201cIt says that we have really strong hardware, which we always knew, but it also shows that the open software frameworks have made tremendous progress.\u201d AMD\u2019s argument hinges not just on silicon performance, but on architecture and economics. By pairing its GPUs with its own CPUs and networking chips inside open \u201crack-scale\u201d systems, branded Helios, AMD is building full-stack solutions to rival Nvidia\u2019s proprietary end-to-end ecosystem. These systems, launching next year with the MI400 series, were designed to enable hyperscale inference clusters while reducing energy and infrastructure costs. Su highlighted how companies like OpenAI, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) are now running inference workloads on AMD chips, with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman confirming a close partnership on infrastructure innovation. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be an amazing thing,\u201d Altman said during the event. \u201cWhen you first started telling me about the specs, I was like, there\u2019s no way, that just sounds totally crazy.\u201d Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) Cloud Infrastructure intends to offer massive clusters of AMD chips, with plans to deploy up to 131,072 MI355X GPUs, positioning AMD as a scalable alternative to Nvidia\u2019s tightly integrated, and often more expensive, solutions. AMD officials emphasized the cost benefits, asserting that customers could achieve double-digit percent savings on power and capital expenditures when compared with Nvidia\u2019s GPUs. Despite the positive news, AMD shares were down roughly 2% ahead of market close. Wall Street remains cautious, but AMD\u2019s moves suggest it is committed to challenging Nvidia\u2019s leadership not only with performance parity, but also with a differentiated value and systems strategy. While Nvidia still commands more than 90% of the data center AI chip market, AMD\u2019s targeted push into inference, where workloads demand high efficiency and lower costs, marks a strategic front in the battle for AI dominance. With generative AI models driving a surge in inference demand across enterprises, AMD is betting that performance per dollar will matter more than ever. Related articles AMD gains on Nvidia?

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Advanced Micro Devices Inc. Chief Executive Officer Lisa Su said her company\u2019s latest AI processors can challenge Nvidia Corp. chips in a market she now expects to soar past $500 billion in the next three years. Most Read from Bloomberg Shuttered NY College Has Alumni Fighting Over Its Future Trump\u2019s Military Parade Has Washington Bracing for Tanks and Weaponry NYC Renters Brace for Price Hikes After Broker-Fee Ban Do World\u2019s Fairs Still Matter? NY Long Island Rail Service Resumes After Grand Central Fire The new installments in AMD\u2019s MI350 chip series are faster than Nvidia counterparts and represent major gains over earlier versions, Su said at a company event Thursday in San Jose, California. The MI355 chips, which started shipping earlier this month, are 35 times faster than predecessors, she said. Though AMD remains a distant second to Nvidia in AI accelerators \u2014 the chips that help develop and run artificial intelligence tools \u2014 it aims to start catching up with these new products. The stakes are higher than ever: Su previously predicted $500 billion in market revenue by 2028, but she now sees it topping that number. \u201cPeople used to think that $500 billion was very large number,\u201d she said in a briefing following her presentation. \u201cNow it seems well within grasp.\u201d In February, AMD gave a forecast for its data center business that reflected slower growth than some analysts predicted. AMD believes the new update to its MI range will restore momentum and prove it can go toe to toe with a much bigger rival. AMD said that the MI355 outperforms Nvidia\u2019s B200 and GB200 products when it comes to running AI software and equals or exceeds them when creating the code. Purchasers will pay significantly less than they would versus Nvidia, AMD said. A representative for Nvidia didn\u2019t have an immediate comment. Investors gave a tepid response to AMD\u2019s latest presentation, with the shares falling 2.2% to $118.50 at the close Thursday in New York. That wiped out the small gains that the stock made this year. Nvidia and AMD are the leading providers of advanced computer graphics chips, which became the basis of components for developing AI. Demand has consistently outstripped supply as some of the world\u2019s largest companies have poured tens of billions of dollars into new infrastructure. That\u2019s forced up the price of chips, which can cost multiple tens of thousands of dollars each. For AMD, the accelerator business has helped it escape the shadow of Intel Corp., its longtime rival in personal computer processors. But Nvidia has eclipsed them both. While AMD is getting multiple billions of dollars from its AI accelerators, Nvidia is generating more than $100 billion a year. Su also previewed what\u2019s coming next, including the follow-up MI400 series that will hit the market next year. She said the product will achieve clear leadership over the Nvidia chips available at that time. AMD is adding more memory and components that can access information more quickly, an important advantage when running AI software, Su said. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman made an appearance on stage with Su, who explained that the MI400 was designed with input from the AI company\u2019s engineers. Altman said that when he\u2019d initially been told about the MI400\u2019s proposed specifications, he thought to himself, \u201cNo way.\u201d He said that the demands on computing infrastructure have accelerated this year as the use of AI services has graduated from an amusing curiosity to one with value to businesses. A key question is whether AMD will be able to sell its AI chips more widely. Like Nvidia, the company is restricted from shipping its most powerful components to China under US trade curbs. AMD is lobbying hard to try to get the Trump administration to allow them to freely offer AI components to other countries. A recent deal announced in Saudi Arabia was signed after consulting Washington to make sure that AMD would be allowed to supply the chips, Su said on Thursday. More freedom is needed to make sure that US technology remains central to the development of AI systems worldwide, she said. (Updates with additional CEO commentary starting in fourth paragraph.)

        "content": "Are robots the solution to China's growing aged care problem? The Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has announced a large-scale trial program to test whether intelligent machines can provide not just physical assistance, but also emotional support for its expanding senior population. What Happened:The ministry has invited private companies with proven track records in elder care to apply for the initiative. Firms must have robust environmental, credit, and safety records to qualify. Selected participants must develop at least 200 robots and deploy them across 20 test sites within two years of approval. Trending: Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing \u2014this is your last chance to become an investor for $0.80 per share. The robots will be evaluated on a wide range of abilities, including cooking, cleaning, and fall prevention, to feeding, lifting, and assisting with going to the toilet, and outdoor mobility. In addition to physical support, the Ministry has also called for building machines capable of \"anti-wandering and anti-falling\" features for dementia patients and tools that can identify early symptoms of cognitive decline. They are also looking for robots that can hold conversations in various dialects, read books and newspapers, and even place video calls to family members. Described as \"intelligent communication companion service robots,\" these machines are expected to counter loneliness and act as possible substitutes for pets. Why It Matters:While the ministry does not explicitly call for humanoid design, the features described are most closely associated with human caregiving. Tesla Inc.(NASDAQ:TSLA) CEOElon Musk, in an article for China's cyberspace authority in 2022, floated an idea somewhat similar to what the ministry is looking for: \u201cPerhaps in less than a decade, people will be able to buy a robot for their parents as a birthday gift,\u201d he wrote, referring to Tesla's humanoid robots currently in development. See Also: Invest where it hurts \u2014 and help millions heal:Invest in Cytonics and help disrupt a $390B Big Pharma stronghold. Last month, Musk shared his belief that humanoid robots will start impacting countries\u2019 GDPs in \"4-5 years.\" He weighed in on the massive amounts of power humanoid robots will require to function to the height of their capabilities. Musk has also asserted that Optimus, his company's humanoid robot, is capable of learning tasks simply by watching YouTube videos, much like humans can. Nvidia Corp.(NASDAQ:NVDA) CEOJensen Huanghas suggested that Optimus might be thefirst humanoid robot to reach both mass production and advanced technical capability. \"I think this is likely to be the next multi-trillion-dollar industry,\" he said.

        "content": "The S&P 500 has authorized record stock buybacks so far this year in what could be a lifeline for the stock market in turbulent times. As of June 5, directors of S&P 500 companies had given management permission to spend a cumulative $750 billion onshare repurchases, a big jump from the $600 billion authorized by the same time in 2023 and 2024, according to recent research from LPL Financial.Approximately 80% of this year\u2019s total buyback authorization is concentrated in three sectors: communication services ($210 billion), financials ($200 billion), and information technology ($196 billion). Record authorizations gave executives plenty of dry powder to use when the S&P 500slid into correction territoryin March. S&P 500 companies spent $283 billion on buybacks in the first quarter, a 24% increase from the fourth quarter and 27% above the same period last year. Tech giants were the most active buyers; Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Nvidia (NVDA) spent a cumulative $73 billion last quarter. Buybacks, by supplementing demand from individual and institutional investors, have the potential tosupport stock pricesduring drawdowns like those seen earlier this year. There\u2019s also evidence to suggest they lower trading costs for everyday investors. A 2021 U.S. Chamber of Commerce study found that theliquidityandprice discoverybenefits provided by corporate buybacks had saved retail investors between $2.1 billion and $4.2 billion since 2004. But a buyback authorization doesn\u2019t guarantee shares will be repurchased. Market conditions, valuations, and management teams\u2019 priorities together determine whether buybacks happen. Stock prices have rebounded from their mid-April lows, putting the S&P 500\u2019s P/E ratio about where it was at this time last year when threats to inflation and growth paled in comparison to today's.That, plus lingering uncertainty about the economic impacts of tariffs, could temper corporate America\u2019s appetite for buybacks. Plus, the companies that have spent the most on buybacks in recent years are also the ones dramatically increasing their business investments. Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet, and Meta plan to spend more than $300 billion on AI infrastructure and othercapital expendituresthis year, a 35% increase from 2024. Amazon is an illustrative example of the way business expenses and investments can preclude repurchases. The company\u2019s board approved a $10 billion buyback program in early 2022. Amazon spent about $4 billion of that shortly thereafter but hasn\u2019t purchased any shares since. Over the same period, capex spending has soared from about $63 billion to an estimated $104 billion.",

It would require the federal government to tax more than it spends\u2014the opposite of what congressional Republicans are proposing in thetax bill being consideredon Capitol Hill. Alternatively, de-dollarization could follow from bank, NBFI, and corporate balance sheets shrinking. But, if that were to happen, as in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, we\u2019d likely see the government increase its own spending, and thus the dollar supply, tostimulate the economy. The U.S. government\u2019s embrace of cryptocurrencies could also be a long-term \u201cdollarizing\u201d force. The Senate on Wednesday voted to advance the GENIUS Act, putting the bill, which establishes a legal framework forstablecoins, one step closer to becoming law. The bill\u2019s co-sponsor, Sen. Bill Hagerty (R-Tennessee), said on Wednesday the act would \u201ccement the dollar\u2019s status asthe world\u2019s reserve currency.\u201d BofA analysts agree that the mainstream adoption of Treasury-backed stablecoins, which they expect will eventually offer interest in some form, is likely to boost the demand for U.S. government debt and, thus, augment dollar demand. Wider stablecoin adoption, in turn, could allow the U.S. Treasury to lower its interest expenses by issuing moreshort-term Treasurys, which have lowercoupon ratesthan long-term debt.",
