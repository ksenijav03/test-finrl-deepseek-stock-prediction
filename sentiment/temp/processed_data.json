        "content": "The S&P 500 (SPX) surpassed the6,000-point mark last week for the first time since February, extending a rally for stocks that's been fueled by optimism about strong corporate earnings andeconomic data, as investors await further developments on the trade front. The benchmark index has rallied sharply from its early-April low to trade just 2.4% below the record high it established in mid-February. Last month, theS&P 500posted its biggest monthly gain since November 2023, as concerns about the Trump administration\u2019s \"Liberation Day\" tariffs have subsided. Below, we take a closer look at the S&P 500\u2019s chart and applytechnical analysisto identify key levels that investors will likely be watching. After climbing above a descendingbroadening formation, the S&P 500 trended sharply higher before consolidating within apennant. More recently, the index broke out from the pattern last week, indicating acontinuationof its recent move higher. Meanwhile, therelative strength indexconfirms bullish momentum, but remains below itsoverboughtthreshold, providing ample room for further upside. Let\u2019s identify two key overhead areas on the S&P 500\u2019s chart and also locate majorsupport levelsto watch during potential retracements. The first key overhead area to track sits around 6,100. This area may provideresistancenear a trendline that connects a series onpeaksthat formed on the chart between December and February just below the index\u2019s record high. Investors can project an upside target above the record high by using the bars pattern tool. When applying the analysis to the S&P 500\u2019s chart, we extract the steep move higher following thebreakoutfrom the descending broadening formation and reposition it from the pennant's breakout point. This projects a target of around 6,575, about 10% above Friday\u2019s close. During retracements, investors should initially watch the 5,770 level. The index could find support in this area near the low of the pennant pattern, which closely aligns with the200-day moving average (MA)and a range of corresponding trading activity on the chart extending back to September last year. Finally, a close below this level could see the S&P 500 revisit lower support around 5,650.

        "content": "By Sam Tabahriti LONDON (Reuters) -Britain lacks the computing infrastructure to deliver the full potential of its leading artificial intelligence research base, Nvidia's CEO said on Monday, as the UK partners with the U.S. chipmaker for a new AI testing environment. Jensen Huang's comments came as the Financial Conduct Authority announced a new framework to allow financial firms to experiment with AI tools in a controlled environment from October, part of a government strategy to support innovation and economic growth. \"The UK is the largest AI ecosystem in the world without its own infrastructure,\" Huang told an audience at London Tech Week alongside Prime Minister Keir Starmer, citing the country's top universities, startups and third-largest AI venture capital market. He praised Starmer's plan to boost Britain's domestic computing capabilities by 20 times and provide 1 billion pounds ($1.36 billion) of investment. \"The ability to build these AI supercomputers here in the UK will naturally attract more startups, it will naturally enable all of the rich ecosystem of researchers here,\" he added, saying Britain was \"an incredible place to invest\". The FCA has partnered with Nvidia to provide access to advanced computing power and bespoke AI. The programme is intended to help firms in the early stages of exploring AI, offering access to technical expertise, better datasets and regulatory support, the FCA said. It is open to all financial services companies experimenting with AI. Finance minister Rachel Reeves has urged Britain's regulators to remove barriers to economic growth, describing it as an \"absolute top priority\" for the government. In April, she said she was pleased with how the FCA and the Prudential Regulation Authority, part of the Bank of England, were responding to her call to cut red tape. Starmer also said in a speech opening London Tech Week that Israeli fintech firm Liquidity Group would open its European headquarters in London, representing an investment of 1.5 billion pounds.

        "header": "One of Jensen Huang's Ambitious Goals Might Make Nvidia Its Own Worst Enemy",
        "content": "The advent and proliferation of the internet in the mid-1990s was a can't-miss trend that captivated the attention of everyday investors. Since this moment, numerous other game-changing innovations have come along that have promised pie-in-the-sky addressable markets. This includes business-to-business e-commerce, genomics, 3D printing, and the metaverse, to name a few hot trends. But over the last three decades, no trend has come particularly close to rivaling what the internet did for corporate America... until now. The evolution ofartificial intelligence (AI)looks to be the next leap forward for the tech industry and society as a whole. The vastness of this game-changing opportunity, which allows AI-empowered software and systems to make split-second decisions without human intervention, is reflected in PwC's estimate that AI will add $15.7 trillion to the global economy in 2030. Image source: Nvidia. A $15.7 trillion addressable market means a lot of companies are going to be winners, from hardware to actual application. However,no company has been a bigger beneficiary of the AI revolutionthanNvidia(NVDA1.76%). The potential problem is that one of Nvidia's biggest perceived competitive advantages might also be its undoing. Since 2022 came to a close, shares of Nvidia have advanced by more than 870%, with the company tacking on over $3 trillion in market cap andcompleting a historic 10-for-1 forward split. Though Nvidia's aggregate percentage return has laggedPalantir Technologies, Nvidia's valuation soared quicker than any megacap stock in history. Nvidia's outperformance is directly reflective of its ideal positioning in AI-accelerated data centers. The company's Hopper (H100) graphics processing units (GPUs) and successor Blackwell GPU have been the preferred options in high-compute data centers. In other words, there's a very high probability that Nvidia's hardware is behind the latest generative AI solutions and the training of most large language models. Being at the leading edge of the hottest trend on Wall Street over the last three decadeshas its perks. With demand for AI-GPUs handily swamping supply, Wall Street's AI darling has been able to charge a veritable arm and a leg for its hardware. Last year, Nvidia's Hopper chip was flying off the shelves with a price tag north of $40,000. For the sake of comparison,Advanced Micro Deviceswas selling its Instinct MI300X series chips for between $10,000 and $15,000. The ability to charge a premium for its hardware sent Nvidia's gross margin soaring. After consistently producing a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) gross margin in the low-to-mid 60% range prior to the rise of AI,Nvidia saw its GAAP gross margin explode to as high as 78.4%in the fiscal first quarter one year ago (the company's fiscal year ends in late January). But it can be argued that Nvidia's greatest competitive advantage is its innovation, which is led by CEO Jensen Huang. Huang's aggressive ambition is to bring a next-generation AI chip to market on an annual basis. It began with the Hopper and Blackwell, and is expected to continue with the release of Blackwell Ultra in the latter-half of this year, Vera Rubin in the second-half of 2026, and Vera Rubin Ultra in the latter-half of 2027. As you might have surmised,Vera Rubin and Vera Rubin Ultra will be running on a new processor, known as \"Vera.\" This processor should be capable of doubling the processing performance of Blackwell Ultra, with considerably improved memory capacity and memory bandwidth than predecessor chips. The key point being that Huang wants to keep Nvidia in its decisive leadership position on the compute front, which in turn should help the company charge a premium price for its hardware, relative to external competitors like AMD and China-based Huawei. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang delivering his GTC Keynote address in 2025. Image source: Nvidia. For virtually all publicly traded companies, innovation is paramount to success. Huang's aggressive spending on research to develop faster and more-efficient AI-GPUs is something that Wall Street and investors would almost universally cheer. But there's a very real possibility that Jensen Huang's accelerated innovation timeline may do more harm than good for his company. While it does appear that Nvidia will hang onto its compute advantages for the foreseeable future, there are far more considerations businesses have to take into account than just compute ability. Imagine for a moment that you're a \"Magnificent Seven\" business and one of Nvidia's top customers that just dropped tens of billions of dollars on the company's hardware to cement your spot as an AI leader. Now imagine your AI-GPUs massively depreciating in value one or two years later because of Nvidia's accelerated innovation cycle. Are you really expected to drop $10 billion-plus every year or two for the latest chip?Highly unlikely. What's interesting is that many of Nvidia's leading customers by net sales within the Mag-7 areinternally developing AI-GPUs and solutions of their own. Though this hardware isn't going to externally compete against Hopper, Blackwell, or the company's successor chips, it'll be notably cheaper than Nvidia's GPUs. Further, since these internally developed chips aren't backlogged like Nvidia's chips, they'll be far more accessible. This points to Nvidia's largest customers by net sales delaying their upgrade cycles.  Nvidia's GAAP gross margin has come under pressure over the last year.NVDA Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly)data byYCharts. We might also see Nvidia's largest revenue customersopt for older chips as they depreciate. Though Huang's entire premise of introducing a new GPU annually is to sustain his company's pricing power, his own accelerated development timeline could crater Nvidia's GAAP gross margin as businesses purchasing their own hardware -- not those leasing data center space -- trade down to less-costly but still quick alternatives. Jensen Huang's aggressive innovation cycle is alsopotentially damaging to data-center leasing models, such as the newly publicCoreWeave(CRWV4.88%). Between 2022 and 2024, CoreWeave used extensive debt financing to acquire approximately 250,000 GPUs, many of which are Nvidia's Hopper chip. The value of these chips will likely depreciate rapidly with Wall Street's AI darling introducing an advanced GPU annually. Businesses wanting cutting-edge compute capabilities might pass on CoreWeave's data centers faster than investors might realize. While there's no question that Nvidia's AI-GPUs are superior to the competition in compute ability, there's far more that goes into a business's purchasing decision. There's a very real possibility that Huang's own ambitious GPU innovation timeline acts as his company's own worst enemy in the years to come.",

        "header": "AMD's Shopping Spree Continues. Is the AI Stock a Buy?",
        "content": "AMD(AMD3.75%)might be the biggest sleeper stock in theartificial intelligence (AI)chip business right now. The stock is down nearly 50% from its peak last year. It seems investors got ahead of themselves in betting on AMD to break through in AI chips and challengeNvidia. However, while the stock has tumbled, AMD's data center business is gaining traction. Revenue in the AI-focused segment jumped 57% in its first quarter to $3.7 billion, driven by growth in its EPYC central processing unit (CPU) and Instinct graphics processing unit (GPU) franchises. In addition to that momentum, AMD has also been making a number of moves to rearrange its portfolio to position it better for the AI era. In the first quarter, AMD acquired ZT Systems for $4.9 billion to help provide rack-scale solutions and high-performance systems, scaling up from its semiconductor business. After making that move, AMD turned around and said it would sell the server manufacturing business to Sanmina for $3 billion and continue to focus on design, rather than manufacturing. AMD is retaining ZT Systems' \"rack-scale AI solutions design and customer enablement expertise.\" However, that's not the only deal AMD has made to advance its AI ambitions. It just announced the acquisition of Brium, a technology company that helps make AI software work across various hardware platforms. The move should help AMD better compete with Nvidia, as AI workloads are typically optimized for Nvidia'sCUDA programming ecosystem. The deal was AMD's fourth AI acquisition in the last two years (the others being Silo AI, Nod.AI, and Mipsology). Silo AI was the largest private AI lab in Europe before AMD acquired it for $665 million, giving the company a team of world-class AI scientists and engineers. Nod.ai, an AI software company, gave AMD a similar boost in AI software for products like the Instinct data center GPUs,  and Mipsology helped beef up AMD's inference software capabilities. Image source: Getty Images. None of these acquisitions have had a significant impact on AMD's share price, but combined, the moves show the company is clearly being aggressive with its AI strategy and that it understands the assignment. It needs to beef up its AI ecosystem to go beyond chips, which the ZT Systems deals help accomplish, and it needs to challenge the supremacy of CUDA or find a way around it. AMD has a similar programming software platform called ROCm, but it hasn't gained nearly as much adoption as CUDA. AMD's success in the future will be determined in large part by how it competes in AI and whether it can close the gap with Nvidia in programming software and other capabilities. The company is likely to continue making acquisitions. For a company with as much upside potential asAMD, the stock looks surprisingly affordable at a forward P/E of less than 30. In its first quarter, AMD reported revenue growth of 36% to $7.44 billion and a 55% increase in adjusted earnings per share to $0.96. Hyperscalers likeOracleand Google Cloud are expanding deployments of EPYC CPUs. AMD's client segment delivered strong growth in the quarter with revenue up 68% to $2.3 billion. For the second quarter, the company expects revenue growth of 27% to $7.4 billion, though that includes an $800 million impairment related to Chinese export restrictions. AMD isn't a sure thing in AI, but the company has a history of success under CEO Lisa Su, and the acquisitions are enhancing its position and improving its prospects. At the current valuation, AMD looks like a smart buy based on its current growth rate and its potential in the large and expanding AI market.",

        "header": "3 Leading Tech Stocks to Buy in 2025",
        "content": "The technology sector has helped lead the market higher over the past decade, and with new technologies such asartificial intelligence (AI)and autonomous driving continuing to emerge, there is every reason to believe it can do the same over the next decade. Let's look at three leading tech companies to buy this year. Image source: Getty Images. Graphics processing units (GPUs)makerNvidia(NVDA1.26%)has established itself as the leading semiconductor company in the world. The strength of GPUs lies in their parallel processing capabilities, which allow them to perform many calculations at the same time. This capability makes these powerful chips ideal for running AI workloads in the data center. The real secret to Nvidia's successes, though, is itsCUDAsoftware program. Created to expand the market for GPUs beyond their original intent of speeding up graphics rendering in video games, Nvidia aggressively pushed the software platform into universities and research labs in its early days, which helped make it the platform upon which developers learned to program GPUs for various tasks. In the years since, the company has built a collection of tools and libraries that help improve the performance of its GPU for use in running AI workloads. This has helped give the company a dominant market share in the GPU space of more than 80%. As the AI infrastructure market continues to grow, Nvidia continues to be the biggest beneficiary. However, that's not its only growth market, and the company also sees a big future opportunity in the automobile and autonomous driving sector. After all, autonomous vehicles need to perform quick calculations, which is the strength of GPUs, so they don't crash. Since Nvidia doesn't have a recurring revenue stream, any slowdown in its end markets is a risk, but right now these markets still appear to be in the early days of their growth cycles. Alphabet(GOOGL3.24%)(GOOG3.02%)is certainly not without its risks, as some investors fret over AI disrupting its search business, while at the same time, it faces legal remedies from the U.S. government after losing an antitrust trial. However, the company has a collection of very attractive businesses and investors have largely ignored the advantages in search the company has. Alphabet is about much more than Google search. Its YouTube business is not only the most-watched streaming platform, but it is also one of the largest digital advertising platforms in the world. Meanwhile, its cloud computing unit, Google Cloud, is Alphabet's fastest-growing business, as it helps customers build out and run AI models and apps on its platform. Also not to be overlooked is its robotaxi business, Waymo, which has a first-mover advantage in the U.S. and is expanding rapidly. That said, Google is still Alphabet's bread and butter, but it's not time to write this dominant search engine off just yet. Google has a large distribution and ad network advantage that should not be overlooked. Its distribution advantage comes from its popular Android smartphone operating system and Chrome browser, which use its Google search engine as a default. Meanwhile, it has a revenue-sharing agreement withAppleand browser companies likeOperato run their search queries, as well. In addition, it has spent decades building one of the largest ad markets on the planet, with an ability to serve not only national advertisers, but also local businesses. Alphabet also knows how to monetize search better than any company, and as the world moves toward AI search and chatbots, it's focused on profiting from queries that have commercial intent. That's why when it recently launched its new AI search mode, it included several commerce-focused features aimed at enhancing monetization, such as \"Shop by AI,\" which allows users to find products simply by describing them, virtually try on clothes using a photo, and even track prices. With unmatched distribution, a massive ad network, and a focus on commerce monetization, Alphabet is well situated to be an AI search winner. Salesforce(CRM-0.62%)has long been the leader in customer relationship management software, and now it's setting its sights on becoming a leader in AI agents through its new Agentforce platform. The company's core value proposition has always been about unifying customer data, and it has expanded this concept into the data center with its Data Cloud offering. Through acquisitions, it's also established a leadership position in employee and customer-facing apps, such as Slack and Tableau. This type of ecosystem is an ideal environment for AI agents to interact with this data and use it to automatically perform tasks. Agentforce includes pre-built AI agents that can help businesses streamline tasks, as well as low-code and no-code tools that let customers design their own custom AI agents with little technical expertise. It has also established an Agentforce marketplace with more than 200 partners to offer more templates and broaden use cases. Thus far, Agentforce has seen solid momentum, with it already having more than 4,000 paying customers since its October launch and many more in pilots. Salesforce is looking to lead a digital labor revolution. It plans to accomplish this through its ADAM framework that combines agents, data, apps, and metadata into one platform. It recently introduced a new consumption-based model that better aligns agent costs with business outcomes to help improve customer satisfaction and increase adoption. Agentic AI is a competitive space, but Salesforce looks like it has the platform to be a winner.",

        "content": "It's clear thatNvidia(NVDA1.26%)has been the biggest winner of theartificial intelligence (AI)infrastructure boom. Itsgraphics processing units (GPUs)have become the go-to chips for running AI workloads in data centers, thanks to their parallel processing capabilities. Parallel processing allows chips to perform many calculations all at once, which is essential for both traininglarge language models (LLMs)and running AIinference. Just as important is Nvidia's CUDA software platform, which makes it easy for developers to build and optimize AI models on its hardware. The combination of best-in-class GPU performance along with a sticky software platform has helped cement the company's lead in the data center space. At the same time, this has been an explosive market. Over the past two years, its data center revenue has gone from $4.3 billion in the fiscal first quarter of 2024 (ended April 30, 2023) to $39.1 billion in fiscal Q1 of 2026 (ended April 27, 2025). That's a nearly 10 times increase in just two years. Nvidia sees data centercapital expenditures (capex)rising to more than $1 trillion by 2028. Not all that spending will go toward GPUs, but with its more than 80% market share in the GPU space, Nvidia is well positioned to capture a sizable chunk of that overall data center spending growth. However, that is not the only potential huge market that Nvidia is eyeing. While AI data center spending is Nvidia's largest market by far, it's certainly not the only end market it participates in. The GPU was originally created to speed up graphics rendering in video games. The company later created CUDA as a way to expand beyond this market, giving developers an easy way to program its GPUs for other tasks. However, the market for GPUs outside of video games was slow to develop. Around the same time CUDA was introduced,Advanced Micro Devicesbought rival GPU maker ATI Technologies. With integration a top priority and not a lot of early traction outside of video games for GPUs, AMD was in no rush to create a competing software platform. Despite the slow uptake, Nvidia smartly began pushing CUDA for use in universities and research labs, which helped make it the default software program that developers were taught to program GPUs. Today, that is why Nvidia's GPUs have a dominant place in the data center. At this same time, though, Nvidia was also edging into another market: automobiles. In fact, Audi was one of its first big customers outside of the video game space. The German luxury carmaker began using Nvidia's GPUs in its infotainment and navigation systems, and Nvidia later built a full automotive platform called DRIVE, which is a family of hardware and software tools developers need for advanced driver-assistance and autonomous vehicle development. Image source: Getty Images. While long promised, autonomous driving is finally here.Alphabet'sWaymo, for example, is now providing more than 250,000 paid robotaxi rides per week in the U.S. It's currently only in a few cities, but it's expanding rapidly. According to reports, Waymo uses Nvidia's GPUs in its vehicles. Waymo is not Nvidia's only automobile customer -- far from it.Mercedes,Volvo,andHyundaiall use Nvidia's DRIVE platform and GPUs to power self-driving technologies, whileToyotaannounced it would use Nvidia's platform and chips for advanced driver assistance features in its next-generation vehicles. Meanwhile,General Motorsand Hyundai will use Nvidia technologies to improve their manufacturing with \"smart factory\" initiatives. Last quarter, Nvidia saw its automobile revenue surge 72% to $567 million. However, more growth is in store, with the company forecasting its auto revenue to rise to approximately $5 billion this fiscal year. The growth will come as new vehicles using its technology begin to hit the roads. Mercedes' new CLA sedan is the latest vehicle with its technology. It's easy to dismiss a segment that was only a fraction of its data center revenue last quarter, but with the data center, Nvidia showed how quickly end markets can ramp up. The autonomous driving market is still in its infancy, so the opportunity is just massive. With Waymo having just around 1,500 robotaxis now, it's easy to see that this could scale to 100x or more vehicles when it reaches scale. Meanwhile, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has predicted that every car on the road will eventually be robotic. With more than 1 billion cars on the road, that's a huge opportunity. At its investor day in 2022, Nvidia estimated the auto market could be a $300 billion opportunity. With Nvidia's stock trading at aforward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E)of 33 times this year's analyst estimates and a 0.7price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio, with numbers below 1 considered undervalued, the stock is currently not pricing in any potential upside from its next big potential market opportunity.",

        "header": "3 Hot Tech Stocks With More Potential Than Any Cryptocurrency",
        "content": "Cryptocurrencies might be worthwhile plays for investors who have a high tolerance for risk. However, they're also notoriously volatile and difficult to value since they often trade on market hype or murky future expectations regrading their scarcity or utility. So instead of chasing the market's hottest cryptocurrencies right now, it might be smarter to invest in three speculative tech stocks:CoreWeave(CRWV3.90%),D-Wave Quantum(QBTS13.05%), andQuantumScape(QS3.64%). These stocks are also undeniably risky, but they're built on firmer businesses with clearer roadmaps for the future. Image source: Getty Images. CoreWeave, which was once anEthereummining operation, abandoned the crypto market in 2018 and leveraged its big inventory of graphics processing units (GPUs) to build an artificial intelligence (AI)-orientedcloud-infrastructure business. After spending about $100 million onNvidia's\u00a0H100 data center GPUs in 2022, it carved out a niche with a dedicated AI platform which was about 35 times faster and 80% cheaper than bigger cloud-infrastructure platforms. It used its own GPUs as collateral to secure more financing, and it attracted some investments from big investors like Nvidia,Cisco, andPureStorage. Its total number of data centers rose from just three in 2022 to 33 at the end of its latest quarter. Its revenue soared from $16 million in 2022 to $1.92 billion in 2024, and it expects that figure to more than double to about $5 billion in 2025. It isn't cheap at 15 times that sales estimate, and its stock has already more than quadrupled since its initial public offering (IPO) just two months ago. But it could have plenty of room to grow as the AI market expands. CoreWeave's lack of profits, high debt, and plans to accelerate its spending on Nvidia's latest Blackwell GPUs could compress its near-term valuations and cool off its stock, but it could head a lot higher over the next few years if it successfully scales up its business and narrows its losses. D-Wave Computing develops quantum annealing tools which can help companies optimize their schedules, workflows, and supply chains. Through quantum computing, which stores zeros and ones simultaneously in qubits, it operates more efficiently than traditional computers which store that data in separate binary bits. D-Wave's core Leap platform, which can be integrated into bigger public cloud platforms, is essentially a quantum-powered efficiency expert. It runs an organization's processes through its systems in various ways, and it identifies the one which consumes the least power as the most efficient. As a quantum-powered platform, D-Wave can map out all of those potential outcomes at a much faster rate than traditional computers. More than 100 companies -- including Deloitte,Mastercard,Lockheed Martin, andAccenture-- already use its services. That makes it a more practical play on the nascent quantum-computing market than its other niche research-oriented peers. From 2024 to 2027, analysts expect D-Wave's revenue to surge from $9 million to $74 million. It's not expected to turn profitable anytime soon, and it might seem absurdly overvalued at 70 times its projected sales for 2027. But it could grow a lot bigger as the quantum-computing market expands over the next few decades. QuantumScape is another speculative stock which could skyrocket over the long run. It develops solid-state lithium metal batteries which have better thermal resistance, faster charging times, and last longer than traditional lithium ion batteries. That makes them well suited for electric vehicles (EV), but it hasn't commercialized any of its batteries yet. QuantumScape is backed byVolkswagen, and its first QSE-5 batteries will have a fast charging time of less than 15 minutes with an EV range of up to 500 miles. Most EVs currently have a range of roughly 300 miles with an average charging time of 30 minutes. It's only shipped a few low-volume samples so far, and it doesn't expect to mass produce any batteries or generate any revenue until 2026. But this year, the company is transitioning from its older Raptor separator process to its newer Cobra process. That long-awaited upgrade should boost its stability and yields to pave the way toward the mass production of its batteries. QuantumScape is worth $2.4 billion right now, but it's tough to value because it's unprofitable, isn't generating any revenue yet, and still faces competition from other battery makers and automakers. But if it successfully scales up its business, it might just attract a stampede of bulls and outperform any of the market's top cryptocurrencies.",

        "content": "When it comes to investing in artificial intelligence (AI) stocks, some of the most common opportunities reside in software platforms and semiconductors. But one pocket of the AI realm that is steadily starting to gain some traction is infrastructure. Think of it this way: When cloud hyperscalers such asAmazon,Microsoft, orAlphabeteach say they are spending tens of billions of dollars on AI capital expenditures (capex), only some of this spend is allocated toward chipsets and network equipment supplied by the likes ofNvidia,Advanced Micro Devices, orBroadcom. In the background, there are companies that are actually building the data centers and graphics processing unit (GPU) clusters in which they reside. This is whereNebius Group(NBIS4.45%)comes into play. Let's explore what Nebius does and how the company is riding the tailwinds of rising AI infrastructure investment. Could Nebius be an under-the-radar opportunity for growth investors right now? Nebius operates across four segments. The company's core business is an infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) business -- essentially offering customers the ability to access high-performance compute architecture via the cloud. In addition, Nebius has three subsidiaries: Avride, Toloka, and TripleTen. Avride is an emerging force in the autonomous vehicle industry, and recently struck a partnership with global car manufacturerHyundai. Toloka serves as a data partner for large language models (LLMs) and AI developers includingAnthropic, Microsoft, andShopify. TripleTen is a software platform marketed toward the education industry, which is another budding area where AI could lead to some transformative changes. Image source: Getty Images. While Nebius is a diversified business and positioned to benefit from AI in many different ways, most investors tend to focus on the company's infrastructure segment. The company works closely with Nvidia, allowing its customers to access a series of different GPU architectures. At the end of the first quarter, Nebius' IaaS business was operating at a $249 million annual recurring revenue (ARR)run rate. While this might not seem like much at first, consider this: Management is guiding toward an ARR run rate between $750 million and $1 billion by year-end, as well as positive adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA). How is Nebius going to increase its core infrastructure segment by nearly fourfold over the next six months? For starters, the company's data center footprint is expanding rapidly. In addition to existing projects in France and Finland, the company is also building out new infrastructure in Iceland, Kansas City, and New Jersey. Moreover, these new data centers will be equipped with the most in-demand GPUs on the market -- of course, I'm talking about Nvidia Blackwell, Grace Blackwell, and Blackwell Ultra architectures. When you consider that major hyperscalers are on pace to spend more than $300 billion on AI capex just this year, coupled with industry forecasts calling for$6.7 trillion of infrastructure spendby next decade, Nebius appears to have strong secular tailwinds fueling its long-run growth narrative. When it comes to investing in Nebius, valuation is a little bit challenging, given the company's corporate history. Toward the end of 2024, Nebius was actually spun out of a Russian internet conglomerate called Yandex. As part of the deal structure, Nebius become an independent entity and listed on theNasdaqexchange. Given the limited financial picture available to investors, I don't find traditional valuation metrics such as price-to-sales (P/S) or other ratios entirely helpful when looking at Nebius. Rather, I'd like to look at the company relative to some peers.  NBIS Market Capdata byYCharts One of the closest comparable public companies to Nebius is AI cloud infrastructure providerCoreWeave, which went public earlier this year. As the graph makes clear, not only does CoreWeave boast a much larger market capitalization than Nebius, but its value is actually expanding. Granted, there are reasons for this. CoreWeave is a much larger company than Nebius on the sales front, and the company continues to strike lucrative partnerships with AI's biggest developers. But even so, it's hard to deny CoreWeave's valuation momentum right now compared to the mundane price action in Nebius. To me, Nebius is flying under the radar -- completely overshadowed by CoreWeave's popularity. I see robust growth ahead for Nebius both in the short and long run, and I think the company's relationships with Nvidia and others in the AI landscape could lead to larger, more strategic deals over time. For these reasons, I would encourage investors looking for new growth opportunities in the AI space to consider a position in the infrastructure services pocket -- and particularly in Nebius.",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The latest earnings period brought what might be an early warning sign about credit quality for high-grade US companies. Most Read from Bloomberg Next Stop: Rancho Cucamonga! Where Public Transit Systems Are Bouncing Back Around the World ICE Moves to DNA-Test Families Targeted for Deportation with New Contract US Housing Agency Vulnerable to Fraud After DOGE Cuts, Documents Warn Trump Said He Fired the National Portrait Gallery Director. She\u2019s Still There. Cash levels at blue-chip companies are shrinking, when excluding results from the most-cash-rich corporations. Among members of the S&P 500 that have posted results, cash levels for the latest quarter fell nearly 1% compared with the last three months of 2024. That\u2019s according to a Bloomberg News analysis that focuses on non-financial companies with less than $30 billion of cash. The group\u2019s cash holdings, now at $1.14 trillion, have broadly been declining since the third quarter of 2023, when they peaked at $1.21 trillion. While companies are still generally performing well, shrinking cash levels can be a sign of business slowing and profits falling. That\u2019s a particular concern now as escalating trade wars potentially boost the cost of foreign inputs, weigh on profits, and increase inflation. Bond prices for many US companies leave little room for error. Spreads, or risk premiums, on US high-grade corporate debt averaged just 0.85 percentage point on Friday, the tightest level since March. The average level for the last two decades is closer to 1.5 percentage point. \u201cIt\u2019s actually a dangerous position to be in,\u201d said Michael Contopoulos, deputy chief investment officer at Richard Bernstein Advisors. \u201cIf you bring down cash balances and you find yourself having to deal with higher inflation and higher volatility, your debt is going to get punished.\u201d For the biggest cash generators, the story is different. Giants from Meta Platforms Inc. to Microsoft Corp. and Nvidia Corp. generally posted strong earnings this quarter. The top 12 biggest holders of cash saw their holdings rise about 1.4%, to around $756.7 billion. The dozen companies, which also include companies outside of the technology industry like Johnson & Johnson, each have more than $30 billion of cash and marketable securities on their books, and hold in total about 40% of the S&P 500\u2019s cash. The biggest companies can distort averages, and by some measures many high-grade companies aren\u2019t looking great. Leverage levels, for example, have been better about 80% of the time over the last two decades, a UBS Group AG analysis found. But by other measures companies are still performing well. Investment-grade firms are holding more cash as a share of their assets than they have on average over the past decade, according to data from S&P that analyzed North American companies. It\u2019s likely the behavior that has contributed to the declines in cash \u2014 such as boosting share buybacks \u2014 has reversed this quarter as companies prepare for a slowdown, Bank of America credit strategist Yuri Seliger said. That\u2019s why some money managers are stopping short of saying that it\u2019s time to prepare for the worst. \u201cYou still want to be positioned in companies that have the ability to weather a range of scenarios, but at the same time, I don\u2019t think you want to price your entire portfolio to the worst possible outcome,\u201d said Maulik Bhansali, senior portfolio manager at Allspring Global Investments. If any credit weakness were to hit, it would likely start with smaller companies, and in leveraged finance or even private credit, said Matthew Mish, UBS\u2019 head of credit strategy. A close look does show some signs of weakness, at least in the smaller firms. Corporate profits for domestic, non-financial companies declined by about 3% in the first quarter compared to the previous period, Bureau of Economic Analysis data shows. \u201cThe large liquid megacaps have certainly outperformed,\u201d Mish said. \u201cUnder the hood, there certainly is a little bit more weakness.\u201d Week In Review Elon Musk is selling $5 billion of debt to help fund his artificial intelligence startup xAI Corp., the latest in a series of fundraising efforts across his business empire as the billionaire pivots away from politics and returns to running his companies. As part of that bond and loan sale, xAI opened its books to investors, showing the company generated about $52 million of gross revenue in the first quarter, and lost $341 million before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization. The sale may be complicated by a very public feud between Trump and Musk.

        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is sweeping across every industry. Researcher IDC forecasts that AI will contribute a total of nearly $20 trillion to the global economy over the next five years. By 2045, AI could drive enormous returns for investors who invest in the right stocks. Here are two stocks that could deliver tremendous returns over the next 20 years. Image source: Getty Images. Nvidia's(NVDA1.26%)dominance in the market forgraphics processing units (GPU)-- vital hardware for handlingAIworkloads -- has placed it in a lucrative position. Even after its meteoric rise over the last few years, the chipmaker still has plenty of growth ahead. Two years ago, on the company's fiscal Q4 2023 earnings call, CEO Jensen Huang stated, \"I believe the number of AI infrastructures is going to grow all over the world.\" He expected to see more AI data centers built, and that Nvidia's chips, networking products, and software systems would help accelerate AI computing by a factor of 1 million times over the coming 10 years. Nvidia's latest quarterly report shows that Huang's prediction is continuing to play out. In a quarter where its revenue grew 69% year-over-year, Nvidia saw accelerating deployments of AI-purposed data centers, aka AI factories. There are nearly 100 Nvidia-powered AI factories in progress right now -- twice as many as there were a year ago. These specialized data centers are being built across every industry and geography. Nvidia is in a solid competitive position with its in-demand full-stack solutions that cover hardware, networking components, software, and systems. Its networking revenue alone jumped 64% over the previous quarter, reflecting a massive jump in demand for networking components to handle the massive growth in data processing and AI workloads that's happening now. Industry estimates pointing to a $1 trillion data center opportunity could be underestimating the actual long-term opportunity for Nvidia. Nvidia has generated more than $148 billion in trailing 12-month revenue and its top line is still growing by more than 50% year over year. That trajectory for a company of this size indicates an enormous opportunity. Nvidiais playing a vital role in meeting the demand for AI. While at some point there could be a slowdown in data center spending that saps Nvidia's momentum, the combination of its powerful GPUs and its popular networking and software solutions provides it with a wide competitive moat. The stock should continue to deliver long-term growth, as it has over the last quarter of a century. Facebook and Instagram ownerMeta Platforms(META1.95%)could be a sleeper AI beneficiary over the long term. When AI ushers in time-saving services like fully autonomous robotaxis, people will have a lot more time to do other things, such as browsing social media. That's just one way AI could benefit Meta's business over the next 20 years that is not reflected in the stock's valuation. Investors can get a hint of the impact that AI could have on Meta's business by looking at how much the company is investing in the technology. It is planning forcapital expendituresof at least $64 billion in 2025, and those investments will go primarily toward data centers. (Investors should note that this rising spending on hardware is also ringing the cash register for Nvidia.) Meta's highreturns on capitalshow that it doesn't spend money like this unless management sees attractive returns down the road. The company is investing in AI for a number of initiatives, including new experiences to drive more useful and immersive experiences across its family of apps. One of the ways it brings more useful content is by showing its users more relevant ads. Over the last few years, Meta has benefited from a growing digital ad market that has started to implement AI technology for improved ad targeting. Revenue grew 22% in 2024, and much of this momentum continued in Q1 2025, when revenue rose by 16% year over year. Meta could also benefit from the launch of new devices powered by AI, such as its Meta AI glasses. More than 1 billion people wear glasses, and Meta believes that in the future, AI will be integrated into a large number of these glasses. So far, it seems to be tapping into a big opportunity, as sales of Meta's Ray-Ban AI glasses have tripled over the last year. More than 3.4 billion people useMeta Platforms'apps every day. That's a huge built-in audience for it to leverage AI technology to grow the value of the business. Its current valuation of 27times forward earningsestimates is a reasonable price, and leaves plenty of potential for the company's growth to drive healthy stock price gains over the long term.",

Nvidia wasnt far behind, trading up 1.3% on Friday with a market cap of $3.47 trillion, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) also breached the $3 trillion mark with a 1% gain to reach $3.02 trillion. Microsofts stock has outpaced the broader Nasdaq (IND), rising 11% year-to-date compared to the indexs modest sub-1% gain. The software giant has been powered by robust growth in its cloud unit, Azure, where revenue jumped 28% year-over-year in Q3 FY25, and by its deepening partnership with OpenAI, which has driven strong demand for AI-powered services. Bernstein Societe Generale Group raised its price target on Microsoft to $540 from $520, citing significant upside potential as Azure continues to scale and AI integration expands across enterprise offerings. Bernstein analysts retained their Outperform rating, noting that Microsofts diversified revenue streamsfrom Office 365 subscriptions to LinkedIn and gamingprovide a hedge against macro uncertainties. Nvidias gains have been fueled by surging demand for its H100 and H200 GPUs, which dominate the AI data-center market, helping it close the gap with Microsoft. Apples performance, meanwhile, reflects resilient iPhone sales and growing services revenue, which has climbed 17% year-over-year to $21 billion in Q2 FY25. Why It Matters: Microsofts $3.5 trillion valuation underscores the escalating AI and cloud war between the tech titans, where gains in enterprise adoption and AI partnerships can translate directly into market-cap milestones.

        "content": "The U.S. equity market made a strong recovery in May 2025, fueled by robust earnings, decreasing trade tensions, and rising investor confidence in the U.S. economy -- a significant improvement compared to the market's performance in April 2025. Now,Deutsche Bankanalysts have raised the target for the benchmarkS&P 500index from 6,150 to 6,550 by the end of 2025. Given this renewed market optimism, artificial intelligence (AI) stocks are poised to be key beneficiaries of the next wave of capital inflows. Long-term investors can benefit from this trend by investing in these high-quality, artificial intelligence (AI)-powered companies that offer significant growth potential in the evolving market landscape. June is a good time to take a closer look at these three top AI stocks. Image source: Getty Images. Nvidia(NVDA1.26%)has reported stellar results for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 (ended April 27, 2025). The company reported revenue of $44.1 billion, representing a 69% year-over-year increase. Nvidia also generated a solid $26 billion in free cash flow. Nvidia currently accounts for nearly 80% of the AI accelerator market. While a dominant presence in AI training workloads, the company is also focused on inference (real-time deployment of pre-trained models) workloads. The company is at the forefront of handling reasoning workloads (computationally intense and complex inference workloads) with its Blackwell architecture systems. Major cloud providers are already deploying these chips at a massive scale -- almost 72,000 GPUs weekly -- and plan to ramp up even more in the coming quarter. Hence, Blackwell is powering the next phase of AI where technology is thinking longer, solving problems, and giving better answers than just responding with pre-written answers. Besides hardware leadership, Nvidia's robust software ecosystem has ensured developer lock-in and a sticky customer base. With theCUDA parallel programming platform, TensorRT for deployment, and NIM microservices for inference, clients find it extremely costly and time-consuming to switch to competitors. The company has also built a healthy networking business, with this segment's revenue growing 64% quarter over quarter to $5 billion in the first quarter. Thanks to the technological superiority of its comprehensive ecosystem, Nvidia managed to provide a healthy outlook for fiscal 2026's Q2, despite its revenue being negatively affected by nearly $8 billion due to export restrictions for the Chinese market. Nvidia stock trades at 31.8 times forward earnings, which is not a particularly cheap valuation. But considering its growth trajectory and competitive advantages, Nvidia is a smart AI pick now, even at elevated valuation levels. Broadcom(AVGO-4.99%)has emerged as a prominent AI infrastructure player in 2025. The company's custom AI chips and networking solutions are being increasingly used by three prominent hyperscaler clients -- rumored to beAlphabet,Meta Platforms, and Chinese company ByteDance -- to optimize the execution of their specific workloads. CEO Hock Tan expects the three hyperscalers to generate a serviceable addressable market (SAM) of $60 billion to $90 billion in fiscal 2027. Additionally, the company is engaging with four additional hyperscalers to develop custom chips, underscoring the even larger market potential. Beyond custom chips, Broadcom is building the critical networking infrastructure that enables the training and deployment of large and powerful frontier AI models. The company's recent $69 billion acquisition of VMware positioned it as a key player in the enterprise software and hybrid cloud infrastructure space. With VMware's cloud orchestration and virtualization technologies, Broadcom can offer full-stack AI infrastructure solutions to its clients. Broadcom stock currently trades at 37.8 times forward earnings. However, considering its critical role in building global AI infrastructure, the company is an excellent pick, despite the rich valuation. Previously a cryptocurrency mining operator,CoreWeave(CRWV3.90%)has now positioned itself as a prominent \"AI Hyperscaler.\" Unlike traditional hyperscalers such asAmazon's AWS,Microsoft's Azure, or Alphabet's Google Cloud Platform, which are primarily designed for general-purpose applications, CoreWeave's cloud infrastructure has been specifically designed for AI and machine-learning workloads. The company has established an extensive network of 33 purpose-built AI data centers across the United States and Europe. Solid demand for CoreWeave's specialized AI-first cloud infrastructure is directly driving its exceptional financial performance. The company reported $982 million in revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, up 420% year over year. At the same time, the company's adjusted operating income rose 550% year over year to $163 million. This highlights that the company is on its way to becoming profitable, despite the high level of capital expenditures typical in the AI data center business. The company had a massive $25.9 billion revenue backlog from multi-year contracts at end of the first quarter. CoreWeave's strategic partnership with Nvidia is proving to be a significant competitive advantage. The deep relationship has given the company preferential access to Nvidia's cutting-edge GPUs and advanced networking technologies. With Nvidia having more than a$2.5 billionequity stake in CoreWeave (at current prices), the latter is practically assured of continued access to next-generation GPUs in the coming years. CoreWeave stock currently trades at 37.5 times sales, which seems quite rich. However, the elevated valuation is justified considering the company's huge addressable market, robust contract backlog, and impressive financial performance, making it a buy now.",

        "content": "At the end of this year, Warren Buffett will be stepping down asBerkshire Hathaway's CEO. Buffett has built an incredible track record of success since taking over the business in 1965 and using it as the foundation for an investment conglomerate that would go on to become one of the world's largest and most successful companies. Buffett mostly made his name and delivered fantastic returns for shareholders through the principles of value investing, but Berkshire has also come to have a larger exposure to technology trends and growth stocks in recent years. And in the tech space, no trend is bigger or more important than artificial intelligence (AI) right now. With that in mind, read on for a look at two stocks that account for roughly 22% of Berkshire Hathaway's $282 billion stock portfolio. Image source: The Motley Fool. Keith Noonan(Apple):With a market capitalization of $3 trillion,Apple(AAPL1.79%)stands as the world's third-largest company, trailing onlyMicrosoftandNvidia. Coming in at 21.6% of Berkshire's total stock portfolio, it's also the investment conglomerate's single largest publicly traded company. It retains that distinction even though Buffett's company sold more than 600 million shares of Apple stock last year. In general, Berkshire Hathaway has been reducing its stock holdings and building up its cash position recently. The move likely reflects concerns that the market at large has become expensive relative to the level of macroeconomic and geopolitical risks that Berkshire's analysts see on the horizon. On the other hand, the move to significantly reduce its Apple holdings likely reflects some specific concerns facing the business. While Apple's leading position in mobile hardware gives it a strong foundation to build out its artificial intelligence (AI) business, the company also seems to be behind leading players including Microsoft,Alphabet, andMeta Platformsin some key respects. For example, Apple has reportedly had significant trouble getting its next-gen, AI-powered Siri platform up to the performance levels that developers were targeting. Additionally, Apple is facing some significant challenges in the Chinese market. The rollout of the company's Apple Intelligence platform was delayed last year because Apple had not found a Chinese company to partner with to roll out the software locally. As a result, sales for the iPhone 16 were relatively soft in the market. The mobile hardware giant has now partnered withAlibaba Group Holdingto make its AI software available, but Chinese customers are still showing increased preference for domestic technology brands -- and geopolitical dynamics could create continued headwinds. Berkshire's move to reduce its position in Apple has meant that Buffett's company has also actually reduced its investment exposure to the overall AI trend. On the other hand, Apple has still retained its status as Berkshire's largest stock holding -- and it seems clear that Buffett remains a big fan of the business. Apple has yet to match the AI successes of some other top tech players, but the company's many strengths suggest it still has many opportunities to be a big winner in the space. Jennifer Saibil(Amazon):Amazon(AMZN2.77%)makes up a small percentage of the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio, and Buffett didn't even buy it. He said that one of the portfolio's investing managers, Todd Combs or Ted Weschler, pushed the button on Amazon stock, because tech isn't really in his wheelhouse. However, he's also said that he made a mistake by not buying it earlier. Amazon is so much more than AI, but generative AI is leading it forward today, representing its greatest growth opportunities. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is Amazon's cloud computing business, where much of the generative AI is taking place. It's the largest cloud services business in the world, with 30% of the market, according to Statista. CEO Andy Jassy believes that very soon all apps will be built with a generative AI component, like databases and storage today. Most of that is going to be built on the cloud, and as the leader, Amazon will account for a vast amount of it. \"Before this generation of AI, we thought AWS had the chance to ultimately be a multi-hundred-billion dollar revenue run rate business,\" Jassy said on a recent earnings call. \"We now think it could be even larger.\" To make that happen, Amazon offers the largest assortment of generative AI tools and services throughout the three layers of its program. The bottom layer is complete customization for its largest clients to build their own large language models (LLMs), the foundation of generative AI. The middle layer is semi-custom solutions through theAmazon Bedrock program, and Amazon offers several tools in the top layer for small businesses that need ready-made programs. These are tools like the ability to create full product descriptions based on prompts. AWS already pulls more than its own weight for Amazon. Sales increased 17% year over year in the first quarter, making it the second-fastest-growing segment behind advertising, and it accounted for 63% of operating income. Will Berkshire Hathaway buy more Amazon stock after Buffett steps down as CEO at the end of the year? It will be interesting to see whether or not the equity positions change without Buffett in the top spot.",

        "header": "why GOOGL (Alphabet) is a great buy right now",
        "content": "With WWDC and the Robotaxi event next week, I'd like to discuss Google and its parent company Alphabet, they have been in trouble for a while now regarding some bullshit anti-trust cases, and I want to tell you why its pure FUD.  Google has really caught up with the rest of the Mag 7 giants in their AI advancements if you haven't noticed.  They have been doing AI machine learning since 2001.  Bard was unimpressive, but that was only little over a year ago.  The speed at which they have been making new advancements is almost hard to track (even across other LLM's).  Have you tried Gemini?  VEO 3 costs 250/m and people are loving it. (the rev. from that will be great as well) and the new AI mode for search seems to finally have been embraced and I think they can actually leverage AI to better serve people the right business ads / referrals.  ***Either way they are monetizing AI***\\*...\\*  Regarding all the FUD, I dont believe the judge can make them sell chrome, EU case is just stupid, the whole thing is about them having monopoly on search and ads...  well there is Bing, Yahoo, DuckDuckGo, Perplexity, Meta / Instagram business Ads, etc..  they have no monopoly anymore if there was one...  I dont believe the cases will result in anything materially bad for the stock but nobody can be sure, so that is why I want to dig into the Fundmental and Technical Analysis.  # ----------- Fundamentals -----------  Alphabet is a massive conglomerate with many subsidiaries.  Lets talk about how they are competing and kicking ass in so many different industries.  \\-  **AI:**    *VEO 3, AI Mode, Gemini, DeepMind* \\- Competing with GPT pro, Microsoft, etc.  (note VEO 3 is still the only model that does text to video PLUS audio.  I think they leveraged youtube for it.  **Data Centers / Internet Provider:**  \\-----*Google Cloud, TPU's, Google Fiber* \\-Competing with many, but their TPU's are very good for AI data centers, and google Fiber competes with internet / service providers like AT&T / Comcast / T-Mobile, etc..  **Quantum Computing:**  \\------Competing with Microsoft, IBM, Rigetti, etc.  **Smart Phones:**  \\------*Android, Pixel Phone* (with Gemini that kicks Siri's ass) - competing with Apple big-time  **Streaming / Ads:**  \\------*Youtube & Google Ads* \\- Competing with Meta and Netflix  **Smart Home / Wearables:**  \\------*Nest, Fitbit,* & ***XR Glasses*** \\- Competing with Amazon, Apple's announced glasses and their 'watch', Microsoft, etc.  **Autonomous Driving / UAV Delivery:**  \\------***Waymo, Wing*** \\- Competing with Tesla (been kicking their ass on it for a while now), GM, and yes, Amazon Air delivery.  *They also just announced another partnership with Walmart to bring more drones to over 100 stores for deliveries!*  **AI in Healthcare / Biotech:**  \\------*Verily, & Calico* \\- working on aging / genetics and ai in healthcare.  \\-*and probably a few others i've missed..*.  but the scope of their work is clear.  \\-  When you buy GOOGL you are buying the entirety of Alphabets investments.  And they are so well positioned from a fundamental and financial perspective as seen in this group of charts.  They make double nearly double the revenue of Nvidia...  [Google makes more revenue than the rest of the Mag 7, nearly double Nvidia's earnings!  the only exception of Apple which could be in jeopardy too if they dont continue to innovate.](https://preview.redd.it/i61ok3bywl5f1.png?width=1183&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab383da02f61b9d5fdc7bb71ce2bde6c7d453ac2)  \\-  Yet oddly, Google has the lowest P/E (price to earnings) ratio than the rest of the Mag 7!  That seems off if you ask me.  I believe they can take plenty of market share back in the future based on these 2 figures.  https://preview.redd.it/a61jyxhzwl5f1.png?width=1125&format=png&auto=webp&s=6b85188b91cd7b2b6b95516e18513586d86d630b  \\-  # -------- Technical Analysis --------  so now lets look at the Chart!  Because Price Action Speaks more than anything else...  I like to use Multiple Timeframes for analysis so here I have the 4 hour, daily, and weekly charts.  I know there are a lot of lines and colors, dont be scared.  The indicators I use are patterns combined with price action, fib levels, TTM squeeze, RSI and some other factors such as price gaps.  \\- With RSI, above/below the 50 line tells you if momentum is bullish or bearish.  All the higher timeframes are above that 50 line indicating a potential bullish reversal.  \\- With TTM it makes it easier to visualize these momentum shifts.  Right now my focus is on that Weekly chart on the bottom right - higher time frames are usually more important and it appears to be on the verge of a weekly breakout.  Now with a stock like this it could take months to reach that earnings Gap and make a new all time high.  When or If this happens depends on a lot of factors, but I am only focusing on the chart.  \\- The Fibonacci Retracements I mostly use for the 50% line to determine if the price has had a change of trend.  Right now the price is attempting a breakout above this retracement and if it can break over 175 then there is plenty of room up.  \\- Ive also illustrated some patterns and concepts on the chart.  Inverted Head and Shoulders, Trendline Break, Higher Highs and Higher Lows, potentially an even larger inverted H&S on the daily chart to the top right.  https://preview.redd.it/d2fprue33m5f1.jpg?width=3676&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=77f0a1e390e7b81ec6f893f6f38220ffc3fde21f  Ok so what does this technical analysis mumbo jumbo mean?  Its hard to say because of Trump, Tarrifs, Deals, Interest Rates, Bonds, Geopolitics, the fact that the market has already just about reached all time highs and this is lagging...  it is concerning.  It could also just be setting up for a massive (bearish) head and shoulders as you might notice on the bottom right weekly chart.  But with WWDC, RoboTaxi, and several trump deals supposedly taking place next week, we could be setup for some bullish continuation if these tech events impress.  Either way, Long Term I believe Google / Alphabet stock will get back to 200.  From a technical and fundamental perspective they are in great shape.  I would even bet that if the market pulls back, that institutions may rotate their Mag 7 holdings into the laggards such as this and Amazon.  While they are aggressively competing with so many different companies and industries, their earnings are expected to continue to grow and as you saw earlier, they earn double what Nvidia earns... Pelosi still has calls, and lets face it, you still use some kind of google product in your life whether its youtube, your android based phone, ai / gemini research, waymo, etc...  I believe Google is well positioned to be a winner this year in AI and many of its subsidiary company products.  \\--------------  # TLDR:  **Alphabet is a great Bet !**  I currently am selling put credit spreads on GOOGL, and have several 180 calls for 7/18 that I only plan to hold through next week before I re-enter as there is going to be a lot going on next week for the markets.  Their earnings are on 7/22 I believe, so August may be a better strike date.  Shares or LEAPS (calls dated atleast for 2026) are also a good idea IMO, you can sell calls against them to hedge when there are large spikes.  **Anyway, I am highly regarded** ***and this is not financial advice,*** but I am very bullish on Google long term.  Its not an easy one to trade if you like short dated options, you need patience, but the chart, the p/e ratios, the incredible amount of subsidiaries competing with more than other Mag 7 companies makes this thing a highly undervalued growth & value stock.  *Price Target short term - 180*  *Price Target long term - 200+*  thanks for getting this far into my regarded ted talk, give it a chance!",

        "content": "A million dollars is enough to change most people's lives. For example, putting that money into relatively low-risk assets like 30-year Treasury bonds would earn you more than the U.S.'s median annual income without reducing the principal. But while investing a million dollars is easy, making it is significantly harder. To earn multibagger returns in the stock market, you typically have to bet on innovative companies with strongeconomic moatsand massive addressable markets.Nvidia(NVDA1.26%)has historically fit this bill with its industry-leading artificial intelligence (AI) chips. That said, past returns don't guarantee future success. Let's dig deeper to see if this megacap technology leader is still a long-term winner. Many analysts were optimistic about Nvidia's first-quarter results, which saw its sales jump by 69% year over year to $44.1 billion while net income increased by 31% to $22.1 billion. Big tech companies continue to pour billions into Nvidia's hardware to run and train theirgenerative AIworkloads. And Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, continues to strike an optimistic tone, claiming that entire countries are beginning to realize that AI is an \"essential infrastructure\" alongside electricity, water, and the internet. However, behind the hype, there are some signs that Nvidia's business is slowing. While sales grew 69% this year, that represents a deceleration from last quarter when they grew by 78% compared to the prior-year period. Furthermore, Nvidia'sgross marginsare also shrinking (down from 73% last quarter to 60.5% this quarter). Net income actually fell by 15% from the previous quarter -- an undeniable sign that things are changing. Some of the weakness is due to recent regulatory challenges in China, where the Trump administration made it harder for Nvidia to sell its H20 chips, leading to a $4.5 billion impairment charge based on losses on excess inventory and failed purchase obligations. And while Nvidia plans to reenter the market with new products, investors should keep in mind the risk of continued regulatory setbacks. Over the long term, Nvidia will face competition from homegrown Chinese rivals such asHuawei, which aims to take its market share with advanced AI chips of its own. And it is unclear if Chinese consumers will be comfortable building their businesses around Nvidia hardware that can be taken away at the whim of the U.S. government. Nvidia also faces challenges in the U.S., where major customers like OpenAI are investing in their own custom chip design capacity to reduce their reliance on Nvidia and other third-party hardware suppliers. Image source: Getty Images. Nvidia has historically been a growth stock capable of multibagger returns. However, with its currentmarket capof $3.4 trillion, this is becoming less likely. If Nvidia were to repeat the 1,500% return it has enjoyed since 2020, its market cap would swell to $51 trillion. That would be more than the combined value of all companies on theNASDAQ stock exchange, which currently totals approximately $30 trillion. While this level of expansion is technically possible, it looks doubtful, even in the best-case scenario. Even though Nvidia has a strong moat, free-market capitalism typically leads to competition and falling margins, which already begins to show up in Nvidia's most recent earnings report. That said, although Nvidia might be too big to be a typical millionaire-maker stock, that doesn't mean it can't return value to investors in other ways. With a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 32.4, shares are still reasonably affordable, considering the company's growth rate. Investors should expect Nvidia to eventually start returning some of its massive profits to shareholders through dividends andbuybacks, which can help support slow and steady stock price appreciation.",

Apple'sannual Worldwide Developers Conferenceopens the week with a keynote session from CEO Tim Cook scheduled for Monday. Cook will likely use the event to address the company's new products, services, and partnerships. GameStop could clarify its cryptocurrency strategy on the company's earnings call, set for Tuesday. Key companies in the growingartificial intelligence (AI)market are also scheduled to update investors on their financials during the week. A U.S. inflation report scheduled for Wednesday could indicate whether President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs are beginning to have an effect on the economy. The news follows ahealthy jobs reportFriday. After markets shook off trade tensions last week to bring the S&P 500back above 6000, investors will keep an eye on tariffs asTrump\u2019s deadline on trade deals approaches. At the same time, the Senate will continue to work toward passage of Trump\u2019s \u201cBig, Beautiful\u201d budget bill amidincreasing criticismfrom Tesla CEO andformer Department of Government Efficiency Chief Elon Musk. Read to the bottom for our calendar of key events\u2014and one more thing. Wednesday\u2019s expected release of theConsumer Price Index (CPI)will be the first look at inflation from May. With a Federal Reserve meeting around the corner, the report could set the tone for the central bank as it faces pressure from Trump to lower interest rates. Fed officials are in their blackout period ahead of their next two-day meeting, which begins June 17. Trump\u2019s tariffswill be a key topic in Friday\u2019s consumer sentiment report, which dropped for four straight months beforeleveling out in May. Consumers areconsistently worriedthat tariffs will drive inflation higher, sending the closely watched survey to some of its lowest readings since the pandemic. As inflation has lately appeared in check, the freefall in sentiment may have hit bottom. GameStop\u2019s (GME) earnings report comes as the video-game retailer dips its toe in the cryptocurrency pool.

        "header": "Catching Falling Knives? Smart Strategies for Buying Stocks in a Downturn.",
        "content": "As stock prices decline, you may feel as if you're at the world's biggest sale. Suddenly, stocks that seemed expensive weeks ago are trading at bargain valuations. You may be tempted to jump in and catch that falling knife, hoping you're buying at the best price. Of course, it's nearly impossible to time the market, so you're unlikely to buy a stock at its lowest and sell at its highest. If you're a short-term investor, this could be a problem. In this case, it's risky to buy a stock as it's dropping because it may take a while for it to recover and go on to gain. Meanwhile, if you aim to sell in a few days or weeks, you may have caught the knife by the blade and find yourself recording a loss. However, if you're a long-term investor, the picture looks much different. You can buy stocks during a downturn because, by holding on for five years or more, you're giving those companies time to recover and grow and the share price an opportunity to reflect that progress. Now, let's check out some smart strategies for buying stocks during a downturn. Image source: Getty Images. Although on the one hand, those bargain stock prices may have caught your eye, you might still worry about investing when the general environment seems uncertain. What if current problems persist? What if stocks fall even further? Those questions could be running through your mind. This is when it's a good time to consider what history has to say. My colleagueAdam Levy recently wroteabout what has generally happened after stocks fall into a correction, and this offers us reason to invest with confidence during these periods. TheS&P 500index(^GSPC1.03%)has slid into the correction zone 15 times since 2008, Adam wrote, citing Dow Jones Market Data, and in all but two of those times, the index was higher a year later. This means that corrections offer us a fantastic buying opportunity, one that will generally start delivering in the not-too-distant future. It doesn't matter when you buy during the correction; even if stocks continue to decline, your gain may still be significant once shares recover and travel through stronger market environments. So, the message here is not to hesitate to buy stocks during a correction. History shows that it's been a great bet for long-term investors. Finally, it's also a smart idea to look atbuyback activityin the recent past. In the fourth quarter of last year, for example, S&P 500 buybacks increased by more than 7% to about $243 billion, suggesting companies are confident about the future. So, growth in share repurchases supports the idea of investing regardless of what the market is doing at the moment. It's impossible to know when the market will enter its next negative phase, but we know it will occur at some point. Markets go through bull and bear markets, as well as many other periods of gains and declines, from rallies to market downturns. Some are short, and some are long. But the good news is that difficult periods don't last forever, and certain types of stocks can help you weather the storm. Generally, the sort of stock that will help your portfolio during a downturn is a value stock. These stocks are in well-established industries, such as energy, healthcare, or financials, and they generate a considerable amount of cash and pay dividends. They are strong, steady, and reliable, and that's why they tend to outperform during tough times. And, of course, investors are especially appreciative of their dividend payments when markets are down. TheMSCI World Value Indexclimbed 6.1% in 2022, a down year for the overall market, outperforming theMSCI World Growth Indexby more than 26%, according to a report by Quilter Investors. All this means that when markets are rallying and growth stocks are soaring, stock up on value stocks that may support your portfolio during the next tough period. Image source: Getty Images. If you have a certain amount of money to invest, you could deploy it all at once ina lump sumor use cost averaging, which involves investing the same amount of money in a particular asset on a regular schedule for a set period. So, for example, in lump-sum investing, you might invest $1,000 right now inNvidia. In cost averaging, you might invest $100 in Nvidia every Monday for 10 weeks. Which strategy will produce the best return? A study by Vanguard shows that lump-sum investing beats cost averaging 68% of the time. That said, the study also showed that in the worst market environments, lump-sum investing resulted in bigger losses. So, which option should you choose? It depends on your relationship with risk. If you're a very cautious investor, you might try cost averaging, at least with certain investments, while aggressive investors may opt for deploying a lump sum right away. In either case, though, investing is a better idea than just holding onto cash. The Vanguard study also found that both techniques outperformed cash at least 69% of the time. This means that, even in the most difficult of environments, if you're willing to hold on for the long term, you're better off investing than staying out of the market.",

        "content": "Stocks and the 10-year US Treasury yield rose after the solid monthly payrolls report on Friday. ... More Market performance has been closely tied to economic data since the early April stock lows.getty Stocks have marched higher since their early April low as the fear of an impending recession has receded. The S&P 500 is 2.3% below its mid-February high, having declined by almost 20%. The Magnificent 7, comprising Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has recovered to only 8.9% below its mid-December level. With many crosscurrents remaining, it seems appropriate to revisit the status of some timely recession indicators.  Market PerformanceGlenview Trust, Bloomberg Recession Indicators Accurately forecasting an economic downturn in advance with any accuracy is exceptionally challenging. However, in an environment with tariff threats, monitoring specific high-frequency data can provide an early warning about increased recession risks. These indicators are updated weekly or daily and have shown a strong correlation with economic activity. Indeed, other indicators are crucial, but they are typically only available on a monthly basis, sometimes with a significant time lag. Despite the economic data remaining resilient, consensus estimates of 2025 US GDP growth remain well below the levels seen earlier in the year. Economists generally expect the drag from tariffs to slow economic growth in the second half of the year.  Consensus US GDP Growth ForecastsGlenview Trust, Bloomberg Credit Spreads Baa corporate bond data has a long history and provides a look at the \u201ctypical\u201d credit quality of companies, as Baa credit rating is the lowest level of investment-grade bonds. The spread is the yield that investors demand beyond US Treasury bond rates to compensate for the default risk associated with buying corporate bonds. These spreads expand when investors worry that more bond defaults could be on the horizon, typically driven by deteriorating economic conditions. Spreads on Baa corporate debt are below the highs hit as stocks bottomed in early April. The narrowing of spreads is consistent with a lower risk of economic downturn.  Corporate Bond SpreadsGlenview Trust, Bloomberg Financial Conditions The Chicago Fed produces the National Financial Conditions Index (NFCI) on a weekly basis. It looks at 105 measures across three categories, risk, credit, and leverage, to create a measure of financial conditions. According to the Chicago Fed, \u201cPositive values of the NFCI have been historically associated with tighter-than-average financial conditions, while negative values have been historically associated with looser-than-average financial conditions.\u201d The chart indicates that periods of tighter-than-normal financial conditions have frequently been correlated with recessions. Similar to credit spreads, the tightness of financial conditions has eased from the early-April highs.  Financial ConditionsGlenview Trust, Bloomberg   Cyclical Stock Performance The more economically sensitive cyclical stocks have recently been outperforming the less economically sensitive defensive stocks. The improved performance of cyclical stocks suggests that the economic growth scare is waning.Cyclical Versus Defensive StocksGlenview Trust, Bloomberg MORE FOR YOUGoogle Confirms Most Gmail Users Must Upgrade AccountsFBI Warns iPhone And Android Users\u2014Do Not Answer These CallsSamsung Confirms Upgrade Choice\u2014Galaxy Users Must Now Decide Yield Curve The 10-year Treasury minus 2-year yield is arguably the most well-known predictor of recession. Historically, when the yield on the US 10-year Treasury falls below the 2-year yield, also known as yield curve inversion, a recession is likely to follow. Since the 1970s, a yield curve inversion has occurred before every recession. The only blemishes on its record are the 1998 and mid-2022 inversions, which did not produce subsequent economic recessions. The US economy did see a significant slowdown in the first half of 2022 but rebounded in the second half. Unfortunately, even when the signal is correct, it has widely variable lead and lag times. The yield curve still has a better predictive track record than economists and is used in nearly every Federal Reserve model; therefore, it is worth watching despite its flaws. The curve is not currently inverted and has generally been steepening instead.Yield CurveGlenview Trust, Bloomberg Jobs The labor market is the most crucial part of the economy since consumer spending eventually wanes without wages to fund the purchases. Initial claims for unemployment benefits are reported weekly, but the four-week moving average of claims is used here to reduce volatility. Initial claims are ticking higher, but the level is not exhibiting a strong uptrend or one consistent with economic woes.Initial Jobless ClaimsGlenview Trust, Bloomberg The other weekly job data is ongoing claims for unemployment benefits, which are also off its lows and show a slow uptrend. The uptrend suggests that it is taking longer for those losing their jobs to find new ones. Recall that the number of employees in the US has more than doubled since 1970, so even though the current roster of those receiving unemployment benefits is as high as it was during the 1969-1970 recession, the numbers aren\u2019t comparable. The labor market is softening, but it has not yet reached the tipping point.Continuing ClaimsGlenview Trust, Bloomberg The closely watched monthly jobs report was released on Friday. Payroll job growth was slightly better than expected at 139,000, but the previous two months were revised lower. The household survey reported job losses of 696,000, but the labor force contracted by a similar amount, leaving the unemployment rate unchanged at 4.2%.Monthly Job GrowthGlenview Trust, Bloomberg Examining the employment of prime working-age people, aged 25 to 54, can provide a good indicator of the labor market\u2019s condition. In addition to being a crucial group, the measure also avoids some of the demographic distortions associated with other methods. Prime-age employment to population ratio fell month-over-month, but using the three-month average to remove volatility, it held steady. The trend appears to be flat to lower, which adds some concern to the outlook.Prime-Age Employment-To-Population RatioGlenview Trust, Bloomberg Overall, job growth is adequate, with the labor market bending lower but not yet breaking. Markets reacted favorably to the monthly jobs report on Friday, indicating less worry about the economic outlook, with US Treasury yields and stocks moving higher. Betting Odds Lastly, the betting market has seen a steep drop in the odds of a recession in 2025. Betting odds move much more quickly than consensus estimates and should be considered more accurate since real dollars are at stake regarding the outcome.2025 US Recession Betting OddsGlenview Trust, Bloomberg What To Watch This Week Wednesday\u2019s May consumer inflation (CPI) reading will be closely watched as some tariff-related price increases are expected to be reflected. On the other hand, some other price decreases should keep the headline inflation growth in check. Consensus expects a 2.5% year-over-year rate, up from 2.3% last month. The Cleveland Fed\u2019s estimate for May CPI is a bit lower at 2.4%.US CPI Inflation EstimateGlenview Trust, Bloomberg The University of Michigan consumer sentiment reading on Friday will be notable. Consumer sentiment plummeted with the announcement of the wide-ranging tariffs on Liberation Day. While economic activity has not followed suit, the sharp plunge in sentiment has raised concerns about an eventual downturn. A rebound in sentiment would be welcome and could help alleviate those concerns. Conclusions Stocks have rebounded as the odds of a recession have fallen. There is still room for the odds to fall further, but the risk remains that they could rise again in the event of a reignition of a hotter trade war. Additionally, the pull forward in activity from and the weights of the tariffs will likely be seen in slower economic growth in the second half of the year.Stocks & Recession OddsGlenview Trust, Bloomberg While much of the existing US tariffs could be struck down by the courts, President Trump has other methods to implement tariffs, even if they take more time and effort. The possible headwinds from the tax-like impact of tariffs remain a threat. On the other hand, the US and China are meeting in London on Monday to negotiate trade matters, which always has the potential to de-escalate the conflict. Successful trade negotiations would help offset the tariff drag. The House of Representatives passed the \u201cbig beautiful tax bill,\u201d so the Senate is now working on it. The final bill is almost certain to include significant growth provisions, such as the extension of expiring tax cuts, additional consumer tax cuts, and the expensing of business investments. If passed, these growth initiatives could provide some sweet dessert to make the tariff vegetables more palatable to economic growth. Investors should note that stocks are pricing in a relatively low risk of recession in 2025 and perhaps looking beyond a possible second-half soft patch to a brighter 2026. This rosy outlook could be correct, and there are potential upsides, as noted previously. However, the labor market appears to be fraying at the edges, so dodging an economic downturn is no sure thing. A host of high-frequency indicators still point to no sign of imminent recession, however.

        "content": "There will prove to be many winners as artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure continues to grow and AI end-uses expand.Nvidia(NVDA1.26%)has been the Wall Street darling surrounding everything AI for the past two years. CoreWeave(CRWV3.90%)has been getting the love most recently, though. Shares of the AI hyperscaler providing cloud services have soared about 185% in just the past month as of this writing. Nvidia stock has increased 24% in that time. CoreWeave just went public in late March, and the shares have jumped about 270% since that initial public offering (IPO). Investors may wonder if Nvidia's shine is fading, and it's time to buy CoreWeave instead. I'd argue that is flawed thinking, however. Image source: Getty Images. Investors may be taking a breather after the early exponential gains in Nvidia stock. Growth in the business itself has also slowed, though that was inevitable. Sales of its advanced chips in the data center segment had been growing like a weed. Revenue in that segment has been increasing in each consecutive quarter for the last two years. In the most recent fiscal quarter, that growth rate slowed to 10%, though, as seen below. Data source: Nvidia. Chart by author. Despite that trend, it's clear AI demand hasn't yet peaked. Remember, these are still sequential quarterly increases in data center sales. For perspective, thatfiscal first-quarter revenuewas a 73% jump compared to the prior year period. Management also guided investors to expect further revenue growth in the current quarter. So, while an unsustainable growthrateslows, the company is stillsolidly in growth mode. That's because it's not just Nvidia's advanced GPU andCPU chipsdriving sales and expanding AI infrastructure. Its AI ecosystem includes interconnect technologies, theCUDA (compute unified device architecture) software platform, and artificial intelligence processors that are part of many different types of architectures. CEO Jensen Huang recently toutedNintendo's new Switch 2 gaming console, for example. The unit includes Nvidia's AI processors that Huang claims \"sharpen, animate, and enhance gameplay in real time.\" Nvidia has a broad array of customers. As AI factories and data centers are built, it will continue to be a major supplier and one that investors should benefit from owning.Nvidia also investsin the AI sector. It makes sense to look at where the AI leader itself sees future gains. One of the AI companies in which Nvidia holds a stake is CoreWeave. Nvidia should know CoreWeave well, too, as an important customer. CoreWeave leases data center space to companies needing the scalable, on-demand compute power it has control of from the 250,000 Nvidia chips it has purchased. It's a desirable option for enterprises that require significant computational power to process large amounts of data efficiently. There appears to be plenty of demand. But there is plenty of risk for investors, too. It just announced a new lease agreement to further increase capacity. Applied Digital, a builder and operator of purpose-built data centers, has agreed to deliver CoreWeave 250 megawatts (MW) of power load on a 15-year term lease at its recently built North Dakota data center campus. CoreWeave has the option to expand the load by an additional 150 MW in the future. Demand is quickly driving growth for CoreWeave. That's led investors to jump in and drive the stock higher in recent months. Valuation is just one major risk with CoreWeave. Customer concentration is another. Last year,Microsoftaccounted for nearly two-thirds of revenue. CoreWeave also disclosed that 77% of 2024 revenue came from just its top two customers. CoreWeave is also spending massive amounts of capital to grow AI cloud capacity. It had about $5.4 billion of liquidity available as of March 31 and raised another $2 billion from a late May debt offering. That's approximately itslevel of capital expenditurein just the first quarter alone, though. That spending may pay off. But there are risks there as well. Customers could develop their own AI infrastructure or could redesign systems that don't require its services. CoreWeave stock also trades at a high valuation after the stock has soared. It recently hada price-to-sales (P/S) ratioof about 30. That could be cut in half this year with its strong sales growth, but it isn't earning any money yet. At the same time, Nvidia sports a price-to-earnings(P/E) ratio of about 30 based on this year's expected profits. Remember, too, that as CoreWeave grows, so do Nvidia's profits. Applied Digital CEO Wes Cummins said that its leased North Dakota data center campus will be full of Nvidia Blackwell class servers. I think the risk profile, financial picture, and massive potential for Nvidia make it the better AI stock to buy now.",

        "content": "Everyone\u2019s watching the Musk vs. Trump drama like it\u2019s the main event, but markets should probably be paying more attention to what\u2019s actually in Trump\u2019s $3T \u201cbig beautiful bill\u201d  because it\u2019s very much alive and moving forward  Despite Musk calling out GOP lawmakers, threatening primaries, and warning about the deficit (which, by the way, multiple analyses say will balloon by $2.4T+), the bill\u2019s still on track. Thune and Senate leadership basically shrugged him off. They\u2019re pushing this thing through  and fast  Here\u2019s where it gets interesting from a market angle:  They're talking about cutting back the $40K SALT deduction to save money. But whatever they save might immediately get canceled out because there's also strong pressure to make temporary business tax breaks permanent  stuff like R&D deductions, bonus depreciation, and interest expensing  That\u2019s a huge deal if you're long big-cap tech, industrials, or healthcare. These tax breaks boost reported earnings pretty directly. If they go permanent, EPS estimates probably move higher without companies having to do anything operationally. Think MSFT, LMT, UNH  names like that  But here\u2019s the tradeoff: the bill\u2019s already inflationary. If they don\u2019t pay for it, bond yields are going to feel it. So while stocks might get an earnings tailwind, valuations could stay capped or even compress further if the 10Y starts creeping above 5% again  And the AI provision buried in the bill? Wild. Originally it said states couldn\u2019t regulate AI for 10 years \u2014 a total federal preemption. Now they\u2019re walking that back to a softer \u201cyou lose broadband funding if you pass certain laws\u201d version. Doesn\u2019t matter much fiscally, but for megacaps like NVDA and GOOG, this is one less regulatory headache. The moat just got a little deeper  One curveball that could raise the cost: Section 899.

        "content": "Investing in today's stock market can be tricky given the volatilemacroeconomic climate, fueled by the Trump administration's ever-shiftingtariff policies. But the artificial intelligence sector remains a robust investment opportunity as organizations around the world race to build artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities. Consequently, AI stocks provide the potential for great gains. One example isCoreWeave(CRWV3.90%). The companywent publicin March at $40 per share. Since then, CoreWeave stock soared to a 52-week high of $166.63 in June. This hot stock remains more than triple its IPO price at the time of this writing. Can it go higher? Evaluating whether now is the time to grab CoreWeave shares requires digging into the company and unpacking its potential as a good investment for the long haul. Image source: Getty Images. CoreWeave deliverscloud computinginfrastructure to businesses hungry for more computing capacity for their AI systems. The company operates over 30 data centers housing servers and other hardware used by customers to train their AI and develop inference, which is an AI's ability to apply what it learned in training to real-world situations. AI juggernauts such asMicrosoft,IBM, and OpenAI, theowner of ChatGPT, are among its roster of customers. The insatiable appetite for AI computing power propelled CoreWeave's business. The company's first-quarter revenue rose a whopping 420% year over year to $981.6 million. Sales growth shows no sign of slowing down. CoreWeave expects Q2 revenue to reach about $1.1 billion. That would represent a strong year-over-year increase of nearly 170% from the prior year's $395 million. The company signs long-term, committed contracts, and as a result, it has visibility into its future revenue potential. At the end of Q1, CoreWeave had amassed a revenue backlog of $25.9 billion, up 63% year over year thanks to a deal with OpenAI. The company forecasts 2025 full-year revenue to come in between $4.9 billion and $5.1 billion, a substantial jump up from 2024's $1.9 billion. Although CoreWeave has enjoyed massive sales success, there are some potential pitfalls with the company. For starters, it isn't profitable. Its Q1operating expensestotaled $1 billion compared to revenue of $981.6 million, resulting in an operating loss of $27.5 million. Even worse, its costs are accelerating faster than sales, which means the company is moving further away from reaching profitability. CoreWeave's $1 billion in operating expenses represented a 487% increase over the prior year, eclipsing its 420% year-over-year revenue growth. Another area of concern is the company's significant debt load. CoreWeave exited Q1 with $18.8 billion in total liabilities on itsbalance sheet, and $8.7 billion of that was debt. To keep up with customer demand for computing power, CoreWeave has to spend on expanding and upgrading AI-optimized hardware, and that's not cheap. As it adds customers, the company must expand its data centers to keep pace. Debt is one way it's funding thesecapital expenditures. Among the risks of buying its stock, CoreWeave admitted, \"Our substantial indebtedness could materially adversely affect our financial condition\" and that the company \"may still incur substantially more indebtedness in the future.\" In fact, its Q1 debt total of $8.7 billion was a 10% increase from the prior quarter's $7.9 billion in debt. Seeing an increase in both expenses and debt is a concern, but because CoreWeave is a newly public company, there's not much history to know how well it can manage its finances over the long term. Q1 is the only quarter of financial results it's released since its initial public offering. If subsequent quarters reveal a trend toward getting costs and debt under control while continuing to show strong sales growth, CoreWeave stock may prove to be a worthwhile investment over the long run. But for now, only investors with a highrisk toleranceshould consider buying shares. Even then, another consideration is CoreWeave's stock valuation. This can be assessed by comparing itsprice-to-sales(P/S) ratio to other AI companies, such as its customer and fellow cloud provider Microsoft and AI leaderNvidia.  Data byYCharts. CoreWeave's share price surged over recent weeks, causing its P/S multiple to skyrocket past that of Nvidia and Microsoft. The valuation suggests CoreWeave stock is overpriced at this time. Although CoreWeave's sales are strong, given its pricey stock and shaky financials, the ideal approach is to put CoreWeave on your watch list. See how it performs over the next few quarters, and wait for its high valuation to drop before considering an investment.",

        "content": "Shareholder perks offered by wine companies are on the rise, with a growing number of wine producers rewarding investors not only with potential financial returns but also withdiscounts on wine, access to exclusive tastings and events, and other nontraditional benefits. Knowing which wine companies offer these kinds of perks isn\u2019t exactly straightforward. The vast majority of wine producers are private companies, especially small\u2014to medium-sized operations, meaning public disclosures are scarce. Even for publicly traded wine companies, information aboutshareholder perksprograms can be hard to find, either hidden in investor relations sections or communicated only directly to shareholders. There are a handful of operations, however, that make their perks programs clear and well-advertised. Here are four publicly traded wine companies offering shareholder perks, their benefits, and the stock ownership requirements to qualify. Willamette Valley Vineyards(WVVI,WVVIP) offers a 25% discount on wine bottle purchases for shareholders owning at least 300 shares of its company. Additionally, qualifying shareholders can enjoy complimentary VIP winery tours, alongside monthly complimentarywine tastings, and access to exclusive events and private wine selections. Crimson Wine Group(CWGL) offers shareholders a 20% discount on select wines and two complimentary tastings at any of its tasting rooms. The minimum number of shares one must hold to access these benefits is not publicly disclosed; Crimson Wine Group did not respond to Investopedia\u2019s queries. French luxury conglomerateLVMH(MC.PA) runs theLVMH Shareholders\u2019 Club. Shareholders need only own a single share, though, given that, as of June 3, 2025, shares trade near \u20ac475 (about $540), that doesn\u2019t mean the program is easily accessible. Memberships give individuals access to an exclusive selection of wines and spirits; invitations to shareholder-only events, such as visits to Veuve-Clicquot\u2019s historic,\u00a0UNESCO World Heritage-listed cellars; and a subscription to a dedicated shareholder magazine. Finally,Andrew Peller Ltd.(ADW.A) offers shareholders discounts with free delivery on select wine bundles on a varying basis. In 2024, for example, the company offered its exclusive collections at a 15% discount for investors ordering both six- and 12-bottle collections. This offer came with free delivery on orders of 12 bottles or more. Therising popularity of shareholder perks programsis not unique to the wine industry\u2014in fact, across consumer-facing industries, companies are looking to transform their growing number of retail investors into repeat customers, as studies show investors tend to buy more from companies that they are invested in. Investing in wine stocks can come with more than just financial returns. Some publicly traded wine companies offer shareholder perks like discounts, tastings, and VIP access. However, requirements and benefits vary considerably, programs evolve, and the exact number of wine shareholder benefits programs is unknown. Therefore, investors looking to pair their portfolios with their palettes are encouraged to contact companies directly to understand eligibility requirements and share minimums.",

        "header": "If I Could Only Buy and Hold a Single Stock, This Would Be It.",
        "content": "Let's make this clear from the start: I would never recommend owning just one stock for the long haul. A proper nest egg needs some variety, either in a carefully assembled basket of diverse stocks or focused on a broad market-tracking exchange-traded fund (ETF). For the sake of argument, however, I could imagine buying someBerkshire Hathaway(BRK.A0.95%)(BRK.B1.11%)stock and just letting it roll. I know, I know. You wanted me to double down onAmazon(AMZN2.77%), whose stock has absolutely crushed the general market in the long run. Or I could have pickedNetflix(NFLX-0.67%), the media-streaming pioneer that's created most of my wealth so far and that might join the trillion-dollar market cap club in a few years. Perhaps you expectedNvidia(NVDA1.26%), with its unmatched five-year returns and huge long-term future in the artificial intelligence (AI) industry. These stocks sure tick a few of the right boxes, but none of them are as naturally diversified as Berkshire Hathaway. That's really what I'm looking for in a \"single stock for all ages.\" I own all three of the suggested Berkshire alternatives above, by the way. Netflix was an early name in my portfolio, inspired by fellow Fool Rick Munarriz's in-depth analysis of the company in the mid-2000s. When Netflix went through the Qwikster-branded separation of DVD and streaming services, I doubled down on my investment at a fantastic price. That particular Netflix stake has gained 10,350% in less than 14 years. But that's just my favorite play on the future of digital media services. I would never dare to make Netflix my only holding, just in case somebody builds a better media-streaming mousetrap. I wish I had pounced on Amazon much earlier, like Motley Fool co-founders Tom and David Gardner did. But I dragged my feet, and watched the online bookstore become an e-commerce buffet with a highly profitable side of cloud computing services. My oldest Amazon investment is only up by 430% since January 2017. Still, Amazon only operates in a couple of business sectors. The company (and stock) could be vulnerable to a sudden sea change in cloud computing, possibly led byMicrosoft's(MSFT0.58%)Windows Azure. And how well would Amazon's dominant e-commerce business perform if global rivals such asAlibaba(BABA-0.38%)orMercadoLibre(MELI-3.98%)found some traction in the American market? Amazon is not a one-trick pony, but the company should pick up a few more skills before entering this single-stock discussion. I'm especially worried about Nvidia's long-term tenacity. The early leader in AI accelerator hardware could very well run into a superior alternative in the next few years. The risk only grows larger if you stretch the timeline out over decades. Rivals likeAdvanced Micro Devices(AMD0.46%)andIntel(INTC0.33%)control tiny slices of the AI chip opportunity so far, but that could change. The next market-defining AI winner could be some upstart I haven't heard of yet. Moreover, leading cloud computing experts such as Microsoft and Amazon already design AI accelerators of their own, hoping to meet their exact needs at a lower cost. Nvidia's big growth spurt might have a few years left in it. I'm just not convinced that the stock will continue to rise after that. My largest Nvidia purchase has posted a 780% gain since June 2022, but I cashed in on those paper gains and sold most of my Nvidia shares earlier this year. This pony needs to learn a few more tricks, too. Image source: Getty Images. So diversity sets Berkshire apart from the biggest success stories of this era. Sure, Warren Buffett's stock-picking and wealth management expertise deserves tons of respect. But he is also known as a great mentor, and many of Berkshire's top-performing picks in recent years were added by Buffett's lieutenants. I expect the company to continue doing wellwhen the Oracle of Omaha retires at the end of 2025. The stock is kind of like a carefully curated ETF. Berkshire Hathaway owns and operates 68 distinct companies these days. The names range from GEICO car insurance and Duracell batteries to Business Wire information services and the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad. Berkshire dabbles in e-commerce (Oriental Trading Company) and clothing (Fruit of the Loom), not to mention home construction (Clayton Homes) and fast food (Dairy Queen). This business list is almost as diverse as theS&P 500(^GSPC1.03%)market index. And that's just Berkshire's in-house brands. The company also owns stock in about 40 public companies. The largest investments include a $60.7 billion stake inApple(AAPL1.79%), a $45.1 billion position inAmerican Express(AXP2.29%), and a $28.5 billion holding ofCoca-Cola(KO0.64%). That's consumer electronics, financial services, and beverage distribution. Apple's gigantic presence may look risky, but the danger looks smaller when you also consider Berkshire's epic collection of fully owned businesses. Do you see a theme here? I do, but it's not a single industry. Berkshire is all about diversity, shielding the company and its investors against the temporary ups and downs in any one particular industry. I don't actually own any Berkshire Hathaway stock yet. I getmy portfolio diversification kicksin other ways, with several dozen hand-picked stocks and a couple of broad index funds serving this purpose. That's arguably a mistake, since Berkshire's stock tends to outperform the S&P 500 in the long run, and I can't compete withthe Buffett team's stock-picking skill. So if you're starting a new portfolio today, or just looking for an alternative to the common S&P 500 index funds,you should give Berkshire Hathaway a serious look. It's definitely a safer long-term bet than Nvidia, Netflix, or even Amazon.",

        "header": "Where Will Nvidia Stock Be in 5 Years?",
        "content": "Nvidia(NVDA1.26%)stock has been under pressure this year on account of various factors, such as the tariff-fueled trade war, concerns about rising competition in the market for artificial intelligence (AI) accelerator chips, U.S. restrictions on chip exports, and fears of a potential slowdown in spending on AI infrastructure. However, the company's latest quarterly results show that it's continuing to grow nicely. Nvidia released its results for its fiscal 2026 first quarter (which ended April 27) on May 28. The company's revenue and earningswere better than Wall Street's expectations, despite its business taking a hit due to the export controls that blocked sales of its H20 processors to China. The data center business was once again the driving force behind Nvidia's impressive results, growing 73% year over year and accounting for 89% of its top line. But at the same time, the company also benefited from the growing adoption of its chips in two other areas. In fact, a closer look at the semiconductor specialist's growth drivers suggests that it is set to benefit from the proliferation of AI in multiple end markets, which could help the stock sustain its solid momentum over the next five years. Image source: Getty Images. The data center business is the cornerstone of Nvidia's growth. Worth noting is that it is growing at a healthy pace despite restrictions on sales of the company's chips to China, whichcost Nvidia several billions of dollars in lost revenuelast quarter. CEO Jensen Huang pointed out that those export controls have effectively closed the $50 billion AI chip market in China to Nvidia. But that shouldn't matter a lot in the long run, as global investment in AI infrastructure is expected to hit a humongous $7 trillion by 2030, according to a forecast by McKinsey, with nearly three-fourths of that directed toward data centers. This huge outlay on AI infrastructure will be driven by multiple factors, such as an increase ininferenceand training workloads, the adoption of AI applications across various industries and applications, and investments by governments around the globe to enhance economic growth and security. So even if Nvidia remains locked out of the Chinese market, it still has a lot of room for growth in AI hardware. The good part is that the company is building AI infrastructure for several countries such as Japan, India, Korea, Spain, Italy, Germany, and the U.K. Huang believes that sovereign AI is set to become the next big growth driver for Nvidia. Importantly, Nvidia is witnessing robust growth in other markets, such as gaming and automotive as well. Its revenue from the gaming and AI PC segment shot up 48% from the year-ago period to a record $3.8 billion. Meanwhile, the year-over-year growth of its automotive and robotics revenue nearly matched that of the data center business. Both these segments can keep growing at elevated levels over the next five years thanks to AI. For instance, IDC projects that shipments of AI-capable PCs will grow at an annualized rate of 42% through 2028. It's also forecasting that shipments of 100-plus TOPSgraphics processing units (GPUs)for PCs will grow from 23 million units in 2023 to more than 36 million units in 2028. Nvidia is the leader in the PC GPU market, with an estimated share of more than 80%, putting the company in a solid position to capitalize on this opportunity. Meanwhile, the company is alsobenefiting from its multiple partnershipsin the automotive market, where its clients are using its platform to develop self-driving features. The automotive GPU market's revenue is expected to grow at an annualized rate of 33% through 2030, generating $45 billion in revenue at the end of the forecast period. This should prove another outstanding growth opportunity for the company. In the end, Nvidia seems well equipped to sustain solid growth rates over the next five years on account of its dominant presence in these multibillion-dollar markets, and that could help the stock deliver more upside. Analysts' consensus estimates are for Nvidia's earnings to increase by 43% in the current fiscal year to $4.28 per share, followed by healthy double-digit percentage gains over the next couple of years as well.  NVDA EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Yeardata byYCharts. The chart above also tells us that analysts have raised their earnings growth expectations for Nvidia for fiscal years 2027 and 2028. Its lucrative growth drivers suggest that it may be able to outpace those forecasts in the long run. But even if we assume that the company's bottom line will grow at an annual rate of just 20% in the two years following fiscal 2028, its earnings could hit $9.50 per share after five years. Nvidia is currently trading at 31 times forward earnings, a discount to its five-year average multiple of 40. Assuming that the stock trades at a discounted forward earnings multiple of 25 in five years, its stock price at that point would be about $237. That points toward a potential gain of 73% from current levels. However, stronger gains cannot be ruled out if the company continues to command a richer valuation on account of its elevated growth rates. That makes thisAI stockworth buying and holding for the long run.",

        "content": "During the month of May, stocks started exhibiting some much-needed resilience. TheS&P 500andNasdaq Compositeindexes rose by 5% and 8%, respectively. After bearing the brunt of precipitous sell-offs early this year, semiconductor stocks have started to stage a comeback. Last month, shares ofNvidiaandBroadcomclimbed by more than 20%, whileAdvanced Micro Devicessurged by roughly 15%. Lagging behind the usual suspects, however, wasTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(TSM0.84%). While the stock's 12% gains beat the broader market, they still trail the chip industry's leading names. Below, I'll delve into why Taiwan Semi looks like a great buy right now. From there, I'll illustrate how a $1,000 investment could wind up being amultibaggerfor patient, disciplined investors. Nvidia and AMD design chipsets known as graphics processing units (GPU). GPUs have the capability to run sophisticated calculations at fast speeds, which gives them an edge over traditional compute processes when it comes to developinggenerative AIapplications. Cloud hyperscalers such asMicrosoft,Alphabet, andAmazon, as well as big tech giantsMeta PlatformsandOracle, have been buying GPUs in droves over the last few years in an effort to build out data centers and infrastructure services. While the robust demand for chips directly benefits Nvidia and AMD, Taiwan Semi has been an indirect beneficiary of these tailwinds. The reason? Because Taiwan Semi specializes in foundry services that actually manufacture the chip designs from Nvidia, AMD, and many others. In other words, the largest data center businesses in the world rely heavily on Taiwan Semi's fabrication business. Image source: Getty Images. In the chart below, I've illustrated Taiwan Semi's revenue, gross profit, and net income over the last three years. As the slopes of the lines indicate, TSMC's sales and profitability profile are both steepening.  TSM Revenue (TTM)data byYCharts To me, this signals two things. First, demand for chips is on the rise -- hence the revenue line is rising. However, the more lucrative trend is that gross margin and net income are accelerating in parallel with sales. This suggests that Taiwan Semi has achieved a fair degree ofpricing powerrelative to competitors such asIntel. Considering AI infrastructure spend isexpected to eclipse multiple trillionsover the next five years, I don't see Taiwan Semi's growth prospects decelerating anytime soon. It's worth noting that technology investors Cathie Wood and Stanley Druckenmiller eachrecently added Taiwan Semi stockto their firms' respective portfolios. While blindly following institutional capital flows isn't necessarily a prudent strategy, I do think TSMC's long-term prospects earn some more credibility thanks to the recent buys by such prominent investors. In the chart below, I've illustrated how a $1,000 investment in Taiwan Semi stock 10 years ago is now worth approximately $8,500. Achieving almost a tenfold return in 10 years is impressive -- even for a growth stock.  TSMdata byYCharts There are a couple of important ideas to take away from the chart above. First, the trends clearly show that like many of its peers, TSMC stock has kicked into a new gear over the last couple of years thanks to a bullish AI narrative. Hence, the share price gains following the sell-off in 2022 appear overly pronounced. Here's the thing, though: Had you invested $1,000 in Taiwan Semi stock on Nov. 30, 2022 (the dayChatGPTwas commercially launched), you would have doubled your money. This underscores the idea that holding on to a stock for long-term periods (i.e. 10 years or more) can lead to outsized gains compared to shorter-term, volatile periods. I think now is a great time to invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semi stock. The company's future growth prospects are arguably far more robust than they were 10 years ago, making now an interesting time to begin accumulating shares for a long-run position.",

While it has gotten a ton of press and attention already,Nvidia(NVDA1.26%)remains a must-own stock for every investor looking to capitalize on the rise of AI. The story here is simple. AI spending has been skyrocketing in recent years, with most forecasts calling for double-digit percentage growth throughout the next decade and beyond. Nearly all of this growth will depend on GPUs and other specialized AI accelerator chips: high-powered parallel processors that provide the specific types of computational muscle to make training and running complex AI models possible. Because it already held the leading position in the GPU space when the AI revolution took off, Nvidia now controls roughly 90% of the market for GPUs destined to support AI applications. So at least right now, if AI innovation and spending continue to rise, Nvidia will directly benefit due to rising demand for its GPUs. Nvidia's dominance in GPUs is no joke. When it unveiled its latest GPU architecture, dubbed Blackwell, last year, the next-gen chips quickly sold out for the next 12 months. According to one report from October, \"Customers who have not yet placed an order with the company won't receive any Blackwell products until late 2025.\" Just to make it clear, Nvidia is by no means competing on price. In fact, it has the highest gross margin by far in the industry, reflecting both its superior offerings and its strong pricing power. There are some long-term concerns. Nvidia may not be able to maintain its high market share, technological superiority, or high gross margins forever. But even if it does cede some market share and profitability, there's a good chance the company can continue to grow at double-digit percentage rates for far longer than its current valuation of 44 times earnings suggests. Image source: Getty Images. Nvidia is now worth more than $3.4 trillion -- in the past week, it has been neck and neck with Microsoft for the title of world's largest company. As such, its long-term growth from here may be limited to a degree by its sheer size. If you're looking to maximize your upside potential in exchange for a little more risk, take a look atSoundHound AI(SOUN6.71%). Most investors haven't heard of this company. Even many AI investors aren't aware of it. That's because SoundHound's market cap is just $4 billion. But if you're looking for big gains, relatively small players like this can deliver, even if the investments carry more risk. As its name suggests, SoundHound AI's business involves AI technologies within the audio arena. Think drive-thru windows where your order is taken by an AI agent, customer support lines operated by AI agents, or even in-vehicle AI assistants that can chat with you about the weather or your car's upcoming maintenance needs. SoundHound already has customers piloting its technology in all of these areas. And similar to the rest of the AI industry, the voice AI segment of the market is expected to grow by 30% to 40% per year over the long term. SoundHound faces heavy long-term competition from big tech competitors that have much deeper pockets from which to fund their research and development budgets. But the potential is there. You'll have to get comfortable with the stock's premium valuation though: Shares trade at nearly 40 times sales. And you'll have to monitor customer growth and competitive pressures. But if you're looking for a company that can deliver 20% annual returns over the next decade and beyond, SoundHound certainly has all the right pieces in place. Just know that shares are for risk-tolerant, long-term investors only.",

        "content": "Buying stocks of companies benefiting from long-term industry trends can help you identify rewarding investment opportunities. The following companies are serving growing demand in the semiconductor and software industries. Here's whyAdvanced Micro Devices(AMD0.46%)andConstellation Software(CNSWF-0.39%)are two stocks I'd consider buying now and holding for the long term. Image source: Getty Images. Shares of Advanced Micro Devices look very attractive right now. The stock is down 50% from its previous high and trades at 29 times forward earnings estimates. This valuation seems too low for a company that just posted a 55% year-over-year increase in adjusted earnings in the first quarter. AMD is the No. 2 supplier ofgraphics processing units (GPUs)behindNvidia. Nvidia has led the GPU market for 20 years, but AMD is poised to gain back some market share as data center operators look for cost-effective chip solutions. Data centerrevenue grew 57% year over year last quarter, but that's before AMD completed the acquisition of ZT Systems. This deal will allow AMD to supply data centers with rack-level AI computing systems combining AMD's GPUs,central processing units (CPUs), networking chips, and software. This should attract more business from top cloud providers that operate massive data centers. Amazondisclosed a new stake in AMD stock worth $84 million in Q1. Amazon Web Services rolled out new AI workloads running on its Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) in the first quarter. Amazon EC2 is using AMD's EPYC processors and Xilinx field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), which AMD acquired in 2022. AMD reported on its Q1earnings callthat every major cloud provider is deep in development in integrating its EPYC Turin processors. This also points to more growth for its data center business. WhileAMDfaces competition from Nvidia and othersemiconductor companies, Amazon's investment signals that AMD still has a valuable role to play in the chip supply chain. With AMD also gaining share againstIntelin the PC market with its Ryzen CPUs, there are enough catalysts here to justify buying a position in the stock right now. Canada-based Constellation Software is one of the best-performing growth stocks that doesn't get much attention on Wall Street. The company has delivered impressive growth over the last decade operating in the vertical software industry. These are companies that focus on providing software products for niche markets like payment scheduling and recordkeeping. This is a large and growing industry, which has sent Constellation shares soaring over 200% in the last five years. Most of the stock's return is the result of savvy deal-making by management. The company's growth strategy is similar to how Warren Buffett grewBerkshire Hathaway, in that Constellation takes the free cash flow from its current software businesses and allocates it to new acquisitions that grow revenue and generate more cash flows. Constellation focuses on acquiring software companies with above-average growth, profitability, and excellent management. Once acquired, Constellation improves their performance, which increases returns for shareholders. Vertical software is a good investment. Companies in this industry are well insulated from competition from big software providers likeMicrosoft. Constellation is focusing on businesses that sell niche software products that are tailored to each industry's needs. These arewide-moatcompanies that can grow for many years. The results speak for themselves. Revenue and free cash flow have grown at a compound annual rate of about 20% over the last 10 years. The company's Q1 revenue grew 13% year over year, withfree cash flowup 14%. The vertical software industry is valued at over $150 billion and expected to grow at an annualized rate of 13%, according to Future Market Insights. This would bring the industry to over $500 billion by 2034. Constellation's annual revenue is just over $10 billion, indicating plenty of long-term upside for investors buying shares today.",

        "content": "IfPalantir Technologies(PLTR6.56%)andNvidia(NVDA1.26%)were in the stock equivalent of a boxing match, we'd have a technical knockout so far this year. Palantir has crushed Nvidia, with its shares skyrocketing close to 70%, while Nvidia's stock is up by only a single-digit percentage. However, the match isn't over. Will Palantir stock trounce Nvidia in the second half of 2025? Image source: Getty Images. Palantir's tremendous momentum in the first five or so months of 2025 has been the result of several factors. The company's rapidly growing commercial revenue is one of its biggest tailwinds. Palantir reported commercial revenue of $255 million in the first quarter, up 71% year over year and 19% quarter over quarter. Its U.S. commercial total contract booking value soared 183% year over year to $810 million, the highest quarterly number in Palantir's history. Of course, Palantir still relies heavily on government contracts. That business is also booming, with the company's U.S. government revenue jumping 45% year over year in Q1 to $373 million. The prospects of congressional passage of President Trump's \"Big, Beautiful Bill\" have also excited Palantir shareholders. Palantir is one of several companies viewed as front-runners in developing the Golden Dome missile defense system included in the legislation. What about Nvidia? Instead of momentum, the tech stock has mainly experienced malaise. The Trump administration's export restrictions on artificial intelligence (AI) chips have created a dark cloud that's hovering over Nvidia's head. The company wrote off $4.5 billion in Q1 because of excess inventory and lower demand for its H20GPUsas a result of those export restrictions. That wasn't the only example of President Trump's trade policies that are hurting Nvidia.Tariffsare having an impact, too. CFO Colette Kress acknowledged in the company's recent earnings call that \"tariff-related uncertainty temporarily impacted\" systems revenue in the first quarter. What's in store for Palantir and Nvidia in the second half of 2025? I'll do my best to peer into the crystal ball to predict the near-future for the two companies. For Palantir, I think continued commercial success is highly likely. Within three days after reporting its Q1 results, the software maker announced a new commercial collaboration with Elon Musk's AI company xAI and investment holding company TWG Global, as well as a partnership with nonprofit healthcare standards organization The Joint Commission. I expect Palantir's commercial revenue will keep growing robustly in the second half of the year. With Nvidia, I predict that its new Blackwell GPUs will remain a smashing commercial success. Blackwell is already the company's fastest ramp-up in its history. I look for Blackwell's profit margins to improve as the year progresses, boosting Nvidia's earnings. My crystal ball gets cloudy on two fronts, though. I'm not sure about whether the \"Big, Beautiful Bill\" will pass the Senate in its current form. And while I think Palantir has a good shot at winning part of the Golden Dome contract if the bill does become law, it's not a slam dunk. I'm also not confident predicting how the Trump administration's trade policies will affect Nvidia in the second half of the year. President Trump's plans change too frequently. It's also possible that the federal courts will ultimately pull the rug from underneath his efforts to levy steep across-the-board tariffs. Let's return to our original question: Will Palantir stock trounce Nvidia in the second half of 2025? I think the uncertainties surrounding Nvidia make it more likely than not that Palantir will outperform Nvidia through the end of the year. However, I wouldn't go as far as saying that Palantir will trounce Nvidia. There's also one key factor that could make Nvidia the better pick in the back half of the year: valuation. Palantir'sforward earnings multipleis nearly 244. If the company's growth were accelerating, that nosebleed valuation might not be so alarming. However, Palantir's growth isslowing. Nvidia's growth is slowing, too. But the GPU maker's shares trade at 32 times forward earnings. That's still high. It isn't in the stratosphere like Palantir's, though. Maybe valuation won't matter over the next few months. However, valuation always matters over the long term. Because of this, I think Nvidia is a better stock to own over the long term than Palantir.",

        "content": "Tesla (TSLA) is expected to launch its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, as soon as this week, with the electric vehicle maker's stock in need of a lift after a week marked bypolitical strifebetween CEO Elon Musk and President Trump. The stock rebounded nearly 4% to close just above $295 Friday, aftertumbling 14% on Thursday. They've lost roughly one-quarter of their value since the start of the year. Tesla bulls believe a robotaxi program could drive substantial upside in the company's stock.Bloomberglast month reported that Tesla was targeting a June 12 launch, citing a person familiar with the matter, adding that the date could change. The company has not confirmed that date, and Tesla did not respond toInvestopedia'srequest for comment in time for publication. Musk said inlast month's earnings calland a May 20interview withCNBCthat the company was still on track to launch the program by the end of the month. The start of the program, Musk toldCNBC,will likely be about 10 Model Y vehicles operating autonomously, with the company later expanding to more vehicles and cities. Tesla owners will eventually be able to add their vehicle to the available fleet of Teslas to rent for a ride, Musk has said, which could help Tesla scale the project before the Cybercab goes into production next year. Oppenheimer analysts recently wrote that the company's ability to get its software to drive fully autonomously with its current suite of cameras could be \"key to its technology leadership and stock performance,\" but added they believe it might take at least one or two more hardware and software updates before Tesla can deliver reliable autonomous performance. More bullish analysts, like Wedbush's Dan Ives, have said they think successful autonomous driving software will be the start of technology that will eventually add $1 trillion in value to the company. Overall, analysts are somewhatdivided on Tesla's stock, with 10 of the brokers tracked by Visible Alpha giving the stock a \"buy\" rating, with four \"hold\" and four \"sell\" ratings. Their average price target is about $304, slightly above Friday's closing level, but their price targets range from as low as $120 to as high as $500.",

        "content": "Netflix(NFLX-0.67%)stock has recently blown past $1,200 per share, making it hard to believe that shares traded at levels below $200 as recently as May of 2022. And the stock's momentum is strong this year, too. Shares are up about 40% this year alone, defying the market's sluggish return of less than 2% as of this writing. With a combination of a strong business, impressive stock price momentum, and a share price in the thousands, a stock split could be in the cards for the streaming giant soon. Image source: Getty Images. Netflix's performance has been stellar. In the first quarter of 2025, revenue rose 12.5% year over year to about $10.5 billion, and earnings per share soared 25.2%. Helping the company achieve such strong earnings-per-share growth is Netflix's widening operating margin. The key profitability metric hit 31.7% in the quarter, up from 28.1% in the year-ago period. The company also reported free cash flow of $2.7 billion, up 25% year over year. Netflix's business growth has been fueled primarily by three key tailwinds: membership growth, price increases, and a fast-growing advertising business. Importantly, the company believes all three of these catalysts have room to run. In its first-quarter update, management reaffirmed its guidance for full-year revenue to increase 11.5% to 14.1% year over year. This growth, management explained, \"assumes healthy member growth, higher subscription pricing and a rough doubling of our ad revenue ... \" Additionally, management continues to forecast a full-year operating margin of 29%, up substantially from 26.7% in 2024. Netflix hasn't split its shares since 2015. Back then, a 7-for-1 split lowered the stock price from about $700 to $100. Today, the share price is nearly double its pre-split peak. That alone doesn't guarantee a stock split. But historically, splits are more likely when a stock becomes expensive (in terms of the share price) relative to other megacaps and the company is on solid footing. Netflix checks both boxes. There's a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu with Netflix today. Just as has been the case recently for the company, it was experiencing strong subscriber growth, record earnings, and benefiting from strategic catalysts the last time it split its stock. Also strengthening the case for a stock split, Netflix shares currently trade far higher than other tech leaders likeMicrosoft,Meta Platforms,Apple, andNvidia. Of course, a stock split would not affect the company's fundamentals, but it would lower the price per share and make Netflix more accessible to retail investors. But it's worth emphasizing that a stock split, in and of itself, isn't a reason to buy a stock. It is, however, often a symptom of strong underlying business momentum -- momentum strong enough to cause investors to bid up the share price to a level worthy of a stock split. It's also worth noting that even though Netflix's business is doing extraordinarily well, investors seem to already be pricing in this momentum. Shares trade at 59 times earnings. All else equal, thisvaluation multiplewill likely come down meaningfully if the company delivers on its revenue growth and operating margin expansion targets for the full year. A combination of double-digit revenue growth and margin expansion should help earnings per share grow dramatically. But with a price-to-earnings multiple well in excess of even fast-growing tech giant Nvidia's, investors seem to be already betting on more staggering growth from the streaming giant. With a surging stock price, impressive revenue growth, and a nascent and fast-growing advertising business, Netflix is a top contender for the next big tech stock split. Though the company hasn't announced plans to split its shares, it's starting to look overdue.",

        "content": "Nvidia(NVDA1.26%)has been a cornerstone of the artificial intelligence (AI) trade for several years. Its share price has increased 850% since January 2023, a period that roughly coincides with the launch of ChatGPT. But Wall Street is still overwhelmingly bullish on the semiconductor company. Angelo Zino at CFRA Research thinks Nvidia \"will be the most important company to our civilization over the next decade.\" More broadly, among 73 analysts following Nvidia, the median 12-month target price is $175 per share. That implies 25% upside from its current share price of $140. Could Nvidia stock turn $50,000 into $1 million over the next decade? Here are my thoughts. Image source: Getty Images. What sets Nvidia apart isvertical integration. The company has over 90% market share in data centergraphics processing units(GPUs), chips that accelerate complex workloads such asartificial intelligence(AI). But the company supplements its GPUs with adjacent hardware likeCPUs, interconnects, and networking equipment. Nvidia also develops software products. AI Enterprise is a suite of tools, code libraries, and pretrained models that streamline the development of AI applications for use cases like autonomous robots, conversational agents, and optimization systems.CrowdStrikeuses those tools to power threat detection capabilities on its cybersecurity platform. Similarly, Omniverse is a software platform that supports 3D application development. It also serves as a simulation engine that lets engineers generate synthetic data for developing machine learning models.Amazonuses the Omniverse platform to optimize warehouse design and train fulfillment center robots. Nvidia frequently sets performance records at the MLPerf benchmarks, objective tests that evaluate AI systems ontrainingandinferenceworkloads. That is an important competitive advantage: Nvidia builds the best AI accelerators on the market. But vertical integration reinforces that advantage by letting the company design entire data center systems with the \"lowest total cost of ownership,\" according toCEOJensen Huang. Grand View Research says spending on AI hardware, software, and services will increase at 35.9% annually through 2030. Nvidia has a good shot at matching that growth rate. Indeed, Wall Street expects earnings to grow at 40% annually through the fiscal year ending January 2027. That makes the current valuation of 44 times earnings seem fair. Nvidia shares would need to increase 1,900% (20-fold) in the next decade to turn $50,000 into $1 million. Returns of that magnitude are theoretically possible in that time frame. In fact, seven stocks currently inS&P 500(^GSPC1.03%)hit that mark in the last decade, as listed: However, while 20-fold returns are theoretically possible, Nvidia has virtually no chance of hitting that mark in the next decade. The company is already worth $3.4 trillion, meaning its market value would hit $68 trillion if the stock increased 20 times. That seems highly unlikely when the entire S&P 500 is only worth $48 trillion today. Nevertheless, Nvidia is still a worthwhile investment. AI will likely be the most transformative technology in history, and the company is well positioned to benefit as demand for AI infrastructure increases. Potential catalysts include generative AI, autonomous vehicles, and humanoid robots. Also, Nvidia has a burgeoning software business that may evolve into a significant source of revenue as those catalysts take shape.",

        "header": "Billionaire Stanley Druckenmiller Has Unloaded Shares of Last Year's 2 Top Performing AI Stocks and Is Piling Into a Growth Stock That Has Climbed 150% in 3 Years",
        "content": "You don't have to be a billionaire to invest like one -- and reap the rewards. Any of us can look at the moves made by the world's most successful investors and follow those that also fit into our investment strategy. Billionaire fund managers have proven their strengths as investors over time, making them excellent guides for novices on the wealth-building path. With that in mind, let's consider the recent moves made by Stanley Druckenmiller, founder of the Duquesne Family Office. Over the past few quarters, he closed his position in last year's two top-performingS&P 500andDow Jones Industrial Averageartificial intelligence (AI) stocks, and just recently, he increased his position in a growth stock that has soared by 150% over the past three years. Could taking those cues be a smart move for you? Image source: Getty Images. So, first, a bit about why Druckenmiller is a billionaire worth watching and potentially following. He founded Duquesne Capital Management in the early 1980s and ran the fund for 30 years. Over that time period, he delivered a truly remarkable annualized average return of 30% -- and importantly, never had a money-losing year. Since then, he has shifted his focus to his family office, where he invests in stocks across industries and oversees $3 billion in securities. Now, let's consider his recent moves, starting with a major one. In the third quarter, Druckenmiller closed out his position in AI chip market leaderNvidia(NVDA1.24%), a company that climbed a bit further from there, becoming the Dow Jones Industrial Average component that delivered the biggest annual gain of 2024. The investor originally bought Nvidia shares in the fourth quarter of 2022, and from the end of that quarter through the end of last year's third quarter, they climbed by more than 700%. So this clearly was a winning investment for Druckenmiller, though in aBloomberginterview, he expressed regret about the timing of the sale, and said he would consider buying Nvidia stock again at the right price. Druckenmiller's second big sale came in the first quarter of this year: He closed out his position inPalantir Technologies(PLTR6.56%), a stock he bought a year earlier. Last year, the AI software company generated the biggest gain in the S&P 500, climbing by 340%. Meanwhile, Druckenmiller increased his position inanother growth stock: pharma giantEli Lilly(LLY0.55%), which in recent quarters has delivered double-digit percentage revenue gains. That growth came largely thanks to its position in a high-growth market with solid long-term potential: weight loss drugs. Druckenmiller increased his Lilly holding by 52% in the first quarter and now owns 94,830 shares worth about $73 million as of the close of trading Friday. Lilly represents nearly 2.6% of the billionaire's portfolio, up from about 1.3% in the previous quarter. He initially bought the stock in 2024's fourth quarter, so he clearly is building a position in it, and sees opportunity for growth ahead. Lilly sells a wide variety of medicines, but investors have focused on its GLP-1 agonist tirzepatide in recent quarters -- and for good reason. Tirzepatide is sold under the name Mounjaro for type 2 diabetes and Zepbound for weight loss, and both drugs are generatingblockbuster revenues. Doctors have prescribed either one for weight loss, and demand has been so high that last year, both were on the Food and Drug Administration's shortage list. These drugs should continue to generate sales growth due to ongoing high demand; analysts at Goldman Sachs forecast that the weight loss drug market will be about $95 billion annually by 2030. One more element may supercharge Lilly's growth in this market. Mounjaro, Zepbound, and the competing GLP-1 drugs on the market today all must be administered via injection, but Lilly has been developing a new weight loss candidate in pill form. Phase 3 trials have produced strong data for the pill, dubbed orforglipron, and Lilly says it will apply for regulatory review in the weight loss indication by the end of this year. The convenience of a weight loss pill that is as effective as the injectables could help orforglipron (and Lilly) take a leading share of the market in the years to come. So the drugmaker's growth may be far from over. Should you follow Druckenmiller's lead, exit Nvidia and Palantir (if you own them), and get in on Lilly shares? All three of these companies are leaders in exciting growth markets and could gain over the long term, so your decisions should depend on your investment strategy. If you're a cautious investor and likepassive income, Eli Lilly is a great choice to own because, while it does offer share price growth potential, it also offers the safety and steady dividends of an established pharma player. If you're an aggressive investor, though, you may want to favor the AI story and continue along with Nvidia and/or Palantir over the long term.",

        "header": "Prediction: This Hot Artificial Intelligence (AI) Semiconductor Stock Will Skyrocket After June 25",
        "content": "Micron Technology(MU2.16%)stock has made a sharp move higher over the past couple of months -- gaining an impressive 37% as of this writing -- driven by the broader recovery in technology stocks. And it won't be surprising to see this semiconductor stock getting a big shot in the arm when it releases its fiscal 2025 third-quarter results after the market closes on June 25. Micron is heading into its quarterly report with a major catalyst in the form ofartificial intelligence (AI)on its side, which could allow the company to deliver better-than-expected numbers and guidance and send its stock even higher. Let's look at the reasons why that may be the case. Image source: Getty Images. Micron's fiscal Q3 guidance calls for $8.8 billion in revenue at the midpoint of its guidance range. That would be a massive increase over the year-ago period's revenue of $6.8 billion. Meanwhile, the company's adjusted earnings are forecast to jump by just over 2.5 times on a year-over-year basis. Investors, however, shouldn't forget that the booming demand for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) that goes into AIgraphics processing units (GPUs)manufactured by the likes ofNvidiaandAMDcould allow Micron to exceed its guidance. Micron's HBM has been selected for powering Nvidia's GB200 and GB300 Blackwell systems, and the good news is that the latter reported solid numbers recently. Nvidia's data center revenue shot up 73% year over year to $39 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2026, with the Blackwell AI GPUs accounting for 70% of the segment's revenue. Nvidia pointed out that it has almost completed its transition from the previous-generation Hopper platform to GPUs based on the latest Blackwell architecture. What's worth noting here is that the company's Blackwell GPUs are equipped with larger HBM chips to enable higher bandwidth and data transmission. Specifically, Nvidia's Hopper H200 GPU was equipped with 141 gigabytes (GB) of HBM. That has been upgraded to 192 GB on Nvidia's B200 Blackwell processor, while the more powerful B300 packs a whopping 288 GB of HBM3e memory. Micron management remarked on the company's March earnings conference call that it started volume shipments of HBM3e memory to its third large customer, suggesting that it could indeed be supplying memory chips for Nvidia's latest generation processors. Importantly, the terrific demand for HBM has created a favorable pricing scenario for the likes of Micron. The company is reportedly looking to hike the price of its HBM chips by 11% this year. It has sold out its entire HBM capacity for 2025 and is negotiating contracts for next year, and it won't be surprising to see customers paying more for HBM considering its scarcity. This combination of higher HBM volumes and the potential increase in price explains why Micron's top and bottom lines are set to witness remarkable growth when it releases its earnings later this month. Additionally, even more chipmakers are set to integrate HBM into their AI accelerators.BroadcomandMarvell Technology, which are known for designing custom AI processors for major cloud computing companies, have recently developed architectures supporting the integration of HBM into their platforms. So, Marvell's addressable market is likely to get bigger thanks to AI, setting the stage for a potential acceleration in the company's growth. Micron stock has rallied impressively in the past couple of months. The good part is that the company is still trading at just 23 times earnings despite this surge. The forward earnings multiple of 9 is even more attractive, indicating that Micron's earnings growth is set to take off. Consensus estimates are projecting a whopping 437% increase in Micron's earnings this year, followed by another solid jump of 57% in the next fiscal year. All this indicates why the stock's median 12-month price target of $130 points toward a 27% jump from current levels. However, thisAI stockcould do much better than that on account of the phenomenal earnings growth that it is projected to clock, which is why investors can consider buying it hand over fist before its June 25 report that could supercharge its recent rally.",

        "header": "Prediction: This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Could Hit a $6 Trillion Valuation by 2030",
        "content": "Nvidia(NVDA1.26%)is the most valuable company in the world as of this writing, with a market cap of $3.4 trillion, and it has reached this position thanks to a tremendous rally of more than 1,500% in its stock price in the past five years. Investors will now be wondering if Nvidia has the potential to deliver more upside over the next five years following this phenomenal run. However, don't be surprised to see this semiconductor giant's shares jump higher and attain a $6 trillion valuation by the end of the decade. Let's take a closer look at the factors that could help Nvidia hit that milestone by 2030. Image source: Getty Images. Robust demand for Nvidia's AI chips has been the biggest reason behind the stock's terrific surge in recent years. The good part is that Nvidia continues to generate a massive amount of revenue from its AI chip business despite tackling headwinds such as export restrictions to key markets like China. This was evident from Nvidia's latest results for the first quarter of fiscal 2026 (which ended on April 27). The company's revenue shot up 69% year over year to $44.1 billion during the quarter, even though it lost $2.5 billion in revenue in fiscal Q1, owing to the restrictions on sales of its chips to China. The chipmaker also incurred a $4.5 billion inventory charge to write down the value of chips that were intended for the Chinese market. Moreover, Nvidia's fiscal Q2 revenue would take an $8 billion hit on account of the China-related restrictions. But the good part is that the company's guidance for the current quarter still calls for a 50% year-over-year increase in revenue, while its earnings areexpected to increase by 44%despite anticipated loss in Chinese revenue. CEO Jensen Huang admitted on Nvidia's latest earnings conference call that the $50 billion Chinese market is now effectively closed to U.S. players such as Nvidia. Even then, analysts have increased their revenue estimates.  NVDA Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Yeardata byYCharts That's not surprising, as Nvidia still has a massive sales opportunity in AI chips beyond the Chinese market. It is now entering new markets such as Saudi Arabia to build AI factories \"powered by several hundred thousand of Nvidia's most advanced GPUs over the next five years,\" according to the company. Additionally, massive AI infrastructure projects such as Stargate, from whichNvidia has started benefiting already, could help it mitigate the lost opportunity in China. Management consulting firm McKinsey & Company predicts that AI-capable data centers could require investments worth a whopping $5.2 trillion by 2030 to build enough computing power to handle training andinferenceworkloads. So investors would do well to look past the China-related problems that Nvidia is currently facing, as the broader opportunity in the AI data center market should be lucrative enough to help the chipmaker keep growing at a healthy pace for the next five years. Moreover, Nvidia is showing no signs of losing its grip over the AI chip market. Its data center revenue shot up an impressive 73% year over year to $39 billion in the previous quarter. That was miles ahead ofBroadcom's $4 billion AI revenue andAMD's $3.7 billion data center sales in the previous quarter, the two chipmakers that are considered to be the closest to Nvidia in the AI chip race. Nvidia's data center growth was higher than the 57% growth recorded by AMD in this segment and close to the 77% growth in Broadcom's AI revenue, even though it has a much larger revenue base. This is a testament to just how popular Nvidia's AI chips are, with the company's latest generation of Blackwell processors already a major hit among cloud computing giants within two quarters of hitting the market. Even better, Nvidia has moved past just selling AI hardware. It also offers access to models that help customers train and deploy AI agents, along with other enterprise AI applications that allow customers to improve the efficiency of theirlarge language models (LLMs). Its enterprise platforms are gaining traction in diverse industries such as cybersecurity and restaurants where companies are deploying Nvidia's solutions to streamline their operations or to build agentic AI applications. All this indicates that investors shouldn't miss the forest for the trees, as Nvidia's long-term prospects aren't dependent on just China. There is still a lot of room for growth in the AI chip market, and the company's diversification into other areas such as enterprise AI applications andautomotive should be enoughto power remarkable growth over the next five years. Nvidia is currently trading at 23 times sales. While that's three times the U.S. technology sector's average price-to-sales ratio, the company's dominant position in AI chips, the prospects of this market, and the other catalysts that are coming into play help justify that valuation. We have already seen in the chart that Nvidia's top line is expected to jump to $292 billion in three years. If it maintains its sales multiple at that time, it will be able to easily surpass a $6 trillion valuation in just three years, representing a big jump from current levels. However, if we assume Nvidia's top-line growth slows after fiscal 2028 to an annual rate of 15% in fiscal 2029 and 2030 from the 31% compound annual growth rate that it is forecast to clock between fiscal 2026 and 2028 (using fiscal 2025 revenue of $130.5 billion as the base), its annual revenue could jump to $386 billion after five years. If Nvidia trades at a discounted 15 times sales at that time, it could still hit a $6 trillion valuation by 2030. So, investors can still consider buying thisAI stockin anticipation of more upside in the long run, as it seems capable of maintaining its healthy growth rate over the next five years.",

        "header": "Got $1,000? Super Micro Computer Stock Is a Brilliant Backdoor AI Play",
        "content": "There are many ways to play the AI investment trend. Hardware companies likeNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA)are powering the training of AI models, suppliers likeTaiwan Semiconductor(NYSE: TSM)are building the chips for Nvidia, and software companies likePalantir(NASDAQ: PLTR)are providing platforms to deploy AI for real-world use. I tend to prefer neutral options in the AI space. That way, I can benefit from the general buildout of AI rather than having one company succeed. While Nvidia is an excellent choice in this realm, so isSuper Micro Computer(SMCI2.46%). Super Micro Computer, often called Supermicro, builds server racks and cooling solutions for data centers to house high-powered computing devices like Nvidia's GPUs. Supermicro has seen impressive growth over the past few years, but what's ahead could make investors even more money. Image source: Getty Images. Server racks are fairly commoditized, so there isn't much to separate one competitor from another. However, one area where a company can make a name for itself is customizability and cooling technology. Supermicro's racks are highly modular, allowing clients of all sizes to find a server rack that fits their workload size and application. Another advantage of Supermicro's solutions is its direct liquid-cooling (DLC) technology. Traditionally, computing hardware is cooled by moving air across the unit, which isn't the most efficient way to cool these units. Supermicro's DLC technology moves liquid across the surface (contained in tubes), which is a far more efficient way to cool them. Furthermore, because these units don't have to account for airflow, Supermicro's clients can pack more server racks into a given space, which helps decrease building costs. Supermicro estimates that this provides up to 40% energy savings and 80% space savings. Supermicro also has key partnerships in the industry, most notably with Nvidia. Nvidia's most powerful chip, based on Blackwell architecture, can be placed in servers purpose-built to hold those exact GPUs, helping users squeeze out every last bit of performance from these chips. In Supermicro's third quarter of fiscal year 2025 (ended March 31), sales rose 19% year over year to $4.6 billion. While that's solid growth, the company faces someheadwinds due to tariffs. Supermicro also faces some headwinds moving into next quarter, with revenue expected to be about $6 billion at the midpoint of guidance, indicating 13% growth. However, one area where Supermicro shines is its valuation, as shares can be scooped up for a dirt-cheap level. Supermicro's stock trades for just15.2 times fiscal year 2026's earnings, which is far cheaper than most of the AI stocks in the market, which commonly trade in the high-20s to the low-30s range.  SMCI PE Ratio (Forward 1y)data byYCharts As Supermicro figures out tariffs and shifts supply chains around, it could see its growth start to reaccelerate, as AI demand is still massive. Nvidia forecast, using third-party data, that data center capital expenditures would reach $400 billion in 2024 but could rise to $1 trillion by 2028. Should this occur, Supermicro will see its business rapidly expand due to the field in which it's playing. That kind of growth could send Supermicro's stock soaring if it can capture the bulk of server infrastructure, making Supermicroa potentially fantastic buy to capitalize on the AI arms race that's still heating up.",

There are some surprises in the mix. I'm Jared Blikre, host of Stocks and Translation. First, a quick setup on these charts. We're showing three time periods, all related to Trump and the markets. White bars at the left show the election-to-inauguration period. Green bars track from inauguration to April 8th. That was the market low. And then the blue bars, they tell the story from that April 8th low through right now. And that's where we're focused. So behind me are the biggest market cap gainers led by Nvidia's blue bar run of over $1 trillion. This week, it reclaimed the title of world's most valuable company thanks to the unrelenting AI boom. By the way, it just lost that title to Microsoft, again. The winners are the usual mega-cap suspects, but don't miss out on Oracle and Netflix at the far right. Both quietly adding over $100 billion each. Oracle is cashing in as the AI landlord, while Netflix, the stealth Fang member, remember them? It just hit a record high this week on analyst upgrades. And let's also pause for Tesla, the ultimate story arc here. A huge run-up post-election, a devastating collapse into the April 8th low, and just this week, a one-day, $150 billion plunge, courtesy of that Musk-Trump dust-up. Now, let's talk about the best stock returns since April 8th. So returns instead of market cap. And at the far right on the top, it is storage chip giant Seagate. It is up an impressive 92% thanks to its signature drives feeding the data-hungry AI servers. But this isn't just a tech story. Look at the industrial and power trio here: GE Vernova Energy, Energy, and Vistra, all up over 65%. Data centers need power, and these utilities are supplying the megawatts. Also, the industrial sector, by the way, just hit a record high this week, showing that the rally is broadening out just beyond the chip stocks. Now, let's take a look at the flip side and see who's getting crushed since that April 8th bottom. Healthcare is definitely in the doghouse, led by UnitedHealth. A Medicare fraud probe and CEO exit erased nearly half of its value, $238 billion in market cap gone recently. And then you have Fastenal. A surprise 95% winner post-election has given back over 40% of those gains with industrial demand weakening. And then there's Enphase, the residential solar darling now down 36% on weak sales. Also note Brown-Forman, yes, that's Jack Daniels whiskey. It is down 22% on dismal earnings. And then there's Regeneron, slipping 18% on drug pipeline worries. So here's the bottom line: since April 8th, AI and chip stocks definitely leading the way. No surprise there, but don't miss the new kids on the block. We got the power producers supplying the AI energy boom, and meanwhile, the market's old guard, that would be healthcare, solar, industrial suppliers, it is stuck in the mud. New economy versus old, and right now the new economy is winning. But how long can that last? Stay tuned.",

        "header": "The Best ETF to Invest in the AI Boom Without Betting on Just One Stock",
        "content": "The AI revolution is here. Over the next decade, many experts believe that the artificial intelligence market will grow from a few hundred billion dollars in value to nearly $5 trillion. Fortunes will be made throughout this growth journey, and one new ETF from popular analyst Dan Ives seeks to give investors a one-stop shop for investing in AI. Looking to add AI exposure to your portfolio? There are three reasons to consider theDan IVES Wedbush AI Revolution ETF(NYSE:IVES). Many investors love to do their own research and select their own individual investments. But when it comes to investing inAI stocks, having some experts along for the ride can help a lot. Right now, there are many popular AI stocks that growth investors are flocking to. But the winners during the next phase or two of these cycles may not be the winners of today. \"I've started this ETF because it's about the second, third, fourth derivatives of AI playing out, and that's the important thing for investors,\" Ives recently explained. \"The AI revolution is the biggest tech theme we've ever seen,\" he added.\"There are plenty of other great vehicles out there, but there's only one that encompasses my investing team and the research that investors have trusted me to deliver.\" There are several new AI ETFs out there, but many invest in companies that aren't directly tied to AI.Amazon, for example, is exposed to AI through its AWS cloud infrastructure division. But that division contributes less than half of its total revenue. The movement of Amazon's stock, therefore, may be unduly influenced by its e-commerce division, not its AWS division, which provides it with its most direct AI exposure. The IVES ETF, meanwhile, aims to maximize your AI exposure by investing in just 30 companies handpicked from Ives's \"AI Revolution Theme,\" which only aggregates stocks with meaningful exposure to AI infrastructure, deployment, and monetization. That includes AI stalwarts likeNvidia, which produces most of the industry's GPUs, andMicrosoft, which has a much higher raw AI exposure than Amazon. Image source: Getty Images. The beauty of ETFs like this is that they let you scale up your exposure quickly. Yes, you are getting expert stock selection. You're also making sure your invested capital is as exposed as possible to the actual AI themes you're attempting to target. But by outsourcing your picks to an ETF, you also give yourself the ability to scale up your exposure at a moment's notice without needing to do a bunch of research on individual selections. In short, vehicles like the IVES ETF let you get quick exposureearlierthan you would have if you needed to complete all of your own research and allocation decisions. \"Two trillion dollars is going to be spent over the next three years,\" Ives estimates. \"Now, I believe we're still in the bottom of the first inning in terms of this non-inning game for AI. And the second, third derivative beneficiaries of tech are just starting to focus on AI.\" If you agree with Ives -- that is, if you think that we are still in the very early innings of the AI revolution -- then getting your money to work today rather than tomorrow may give you a chance to lock in early cycle valuations before the rest of the market catches on. The IVES ETF isn't perfect. It comes with a very high 0.75% expense ratio, which will cut into your profits. It also has no historical track record, adding some level of uncertainty for its performance potential. Plus, Ives himself has said that he doesn't care much for valuations. \"I've never been too focused on valuations,\" Ives recently said. \"It's about the themes, the best places, and the disruptors. That's all the work we do in the field.\" Investors looking to do their own research, limit fees, and focus on valuation should likely look elsewhere. But for those willing to get instant exposure to expert AI stock selections, the IVES ETF is a promising new investment vehicle for aggressive growth investors.",

        "header": "Broadcom, Nvidia, and AMD Could Help This Unstoppable ETF Turn $250,000 Into $1 Million in 10 Years",
        "content": "Nvidia(NVDA1.26%)CEO Jensen Huang thinks that data center operators will spend $1 trillion every year on chips and infrastructure by 2028 to meet growing demand for computing capacity from next-generation artificial intelligence (AI) models. That spending will be an enormous tailwind for Nvidia, which supplies the world's most powerful data center chips for AI development. But the benefits will also flow through to the company's competitors, not to mention suppliers of other data center hardware components. There is an opportunity for investors to profit from this tech revolution, and buying an exchange-traded fund (ETF) might be the simplest way to do so. TheiShares Semiconductor ETF(SOXX1.29%)invests exclusively in suppliers of chips and components, and its top holdings happen to be three of the biggest names in AI: Nvidia,Broadcom(AVGO-1.47%), andAdvanced Micro Devices(AMD0.46%). The ETF has outperformed the broader stock market since its establishment in 2001, and here's how it could turn an investment of $250,000 into $1 million within the coming decade. Image source: Getty Images. SomeETFshold thousands of different stocks, but the iShares Semiconductor ETF holds just 30. It aims to offer investors exposure to companies that design, manufacture, and distribute semiconductors, primarily those that stand to benefit from megatrends such asAI. Since the ETF was established in 2001, it has helped investors successfully navigate several tech revolutions driven by the internet, enterprise software, smartphones, andcloud computing. It's now heavily geared toward AI, and its top five holdings are among the biggest names in the hardware side of the industry: Stock iShares ETF Portfolio Weighting 1. Broadcom 10.07% 2. Nvidia 8.74% 3. Texas Instruments 7.49% 4. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) 7.30% 5. Qualcomm 5.83% Data source: iShares. Portfolio weightings are accurate as of June 4, 2025, and are subject to change. ETF = exchange-traded fund. Nvidia'sgraphics processing units (GPUs)are the most popular data center chips among AI developers. The company's latest GPU architectures, Blackwell and Blackwell Ultra, are designed for a new generation of AI models capable of 'reasoning,' which means they spend time thinking in the background to generate the most accurate responses. Jensen Huang says some of these models consume up to 1,000 times more computing capacity than traditional one-shotlarge language models (LMs), hence his lofty spending forecast mentioned earlier. Amazon,Microsoft, andAlphabetare three of Nvidia's biggest customers. They are seasoned data center operators because of their industry-leading cloud platforms, but they are now racing to build AI infrastructure to meet surging demand from developers. But these companies are also trying to diversify their hardware portfolios by designing their own chips in collaboration with suppliers like Broadcom, which helps with the design and manufacturing processes.Broadcomis targeting a $90 billion market opportunity for its custom AI accelerator chips by 2027, with just three customers already on board and more in the pipeline. Plus, the company is a leading supplier of networking equipment, which helps to extract the most performance from AI chips. Then there is AMD, which released aline of GPUs to compete directly with Nvidiain the data center. This year, the company will start shipping its latest chips based on its CNA (Compute DNA) 4 architecture, which was designed to rival Blackwell. AMD is also already a leader in AI chips for personal computers, which could be a major growth area in the future. Investors will also find other leading AI chip stocks, such asMicron Technology,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, andArm Holdings, outside the top five holdings in the iShares ETF. The iShares Semiconductor ETF has delivered a compound annual return of 10.4% since its establishment in 2001, outperforming the average annual gain of 7.9% in theS&P 500over the same period. But the ETF has delivered an accelerated annual return of 20.9% over the past decade, driven by the accelerating adoption of technologies like cloud computing and AI. If the iShares ETF continues to deliver annual gains of 20.9%, it could turn a $250,000 investment into over $1.6 million in the next decade. It won't be easy, but if AI infrastructure spending grows to $1 trillion per year by 2028, as Jensen Huang expects, it certainly isn't out of the question. However, even if the ETF averages an annual gain of 15.6% over the next 10 years, that would be enough to turn $250,000 into $1 million: Starting Balance Compound Annual Return Balance in 10 Years $250,000 10.4% $672,404 $250,000 15.6% (midpoint) $1,065,413 $250,000 20.9% $1,668,026 Calculations by author. Last year, Huang saiddata centeroperators could earn $5 over four years for every $1 they spend on Nvidia's AI chips and infrastructure by renting the computing capacity to AI developers. If those economics are accurate, data center operators like Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet are likely to continue investing heavily in new infrastructure long into the future. Plus, every new generation of AI models typically requires even more computing capacity than the last, so it's possible that Huang's spending forecasts will prove to be conservative when we look back on this moment. In any case, the iShares ETF could be a great addition to a diversified portfolio.",

        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA,Financials)provided new clarityon key investor concerns during a private investor dinner hosted by Bank of America in San Francisco, reinforcing its long-term AI strategy and execution roadmap. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. The event featured Nvidia CFO Colette Kress, VP of Investor Relations Toshiya Hari, and VP Ian Buck, who addressed three core concerns: the rollout of the Blackwell rack systems, global AI diffusion including sovereign demand, and the impact of U.S. export restrictions on Chinese AI chip shipments. Blackwell NVL rack systems were said to be fully ramped as of June 5, with roughly 70% of Nvidia's compute sales in fiscal Q1 tied to the platform. The firm also confirmed that production of Blackwell Ultra will begin in the current quarter, with volume expected to rise in the second half. The next-generation Rubin and Feynman architectures remain on schedule, supporting Nvidia's annual product cadence. Bank of America estimated Nvidia's total addressable data center market opportunity between $250 billion and $350 billion, based on third-party projections of 5 to 7 gigawatts of new capacity in 2025. Nvidia's current pipeline stands at roughly $175 billion, supported by what the analyst called a symbiotic relationship with hyperscalers. The analyst added that the company has fully de-risked China in its latest data center forecasts, removing any projected sales tied to the H20 AI chip, which was subject to export licensing restrictions during the first quarter. Nvidia previously disclosed a $2.5 billion sales hit related to those restrictions in its May 28 earnings. The easing of sovereign AI restrictions was also seen as a tailwind, with Nvidia now able to serve government-backed AI demand either directly or through cloud and enterprise intermediaries. Bank of America reiterated a Buy rating and a $180 price objective for Nvidia, citing the company's multi-year lead in performance, pipeline, incumbency, scale, and developer support as key reasons for sustained upside in the AI cycle. Nvidia previously reported fiscal Q1 revenue of $44.1 billion, up 69% year over year. This article first appeared onGuruFocus.",

        "content": "June 9 -NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) board member Mark A. Stevens sold more than$149 millionworth of company shares earlier last week, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The transaction involved the sale of over 1.06 million shares, totaling $149.1 million. The filing did not specify the reason for the disposal. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. Stevens, a longtime board director and tech investor, has previously reduced his stake in the chipmaker. Insider activity is often watched for signals on company valuation or timing, though sales can be due to various personal or financial planning reasons. NVIDIA remains a leading supplier of graphics processors used in gaming, artificial intelligence, and data centers. The company posted revenue growth of 69% year-over-year for the quarter ended April 30, supported by expanding demand for AI chips. Its gross margin stands at about 60.5%, outpacing peers in the information technology sector. While earnings per share have come under pressure, NVIDIA maintains a conservative debt position, with a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.12, below the sector average. While Stevens' sizable share sale may raise eyebrows among investors, it doesn't necessarily signal trouble for NVIDIA's fundamentals. The company remains firmly positioned at the center of the AI hardware boom, with strong margins, accelerating top-line growth, and minimal debt. Still, insider transactions of this scale can serve as a reminder for investors to reassess valuation risks, especially after the stock's sharp rally. This article first appeared onGuruFocus.",

        "content": "Just when some were thinking the artificial intelligence (AI) trade was dead,Nvidia(NVDA1.26%)and other big tech stocks knocked their earnings reports out of the park. The fact is that investment in AI technology, data centers, and other infrastructure is booming with no end in sight. Just last week,Amazon(AMZN2.77%)announced plans to invest another $10 billion in new data centers in North Carolina. Big Tech companies are expected to spend $325 billion this year, a significant increase over the $223 billion invested in 2024. Far from being over, investment in AI is just getting started. As you can see below, the AI market is poised to experience significant growth through the end of the decade, and likely well beyond. Statista Here are two companies every tech investor should have on their radar. Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are critical infrastructure for data centers, and the big tech companies are battling to acquire as many as possible. For example, Elon Musk's xAI supercomputer initially started with 100,000 units, doubled this number to 200,000, and rumors suggest it plans to grow to 1,000,000 units in the future. Projects like the one mentioned above for Amazon also require untold thousands of GPUs, and there are many of these projects in progress across the U.S. and the world. The incredible demand is not slacking and is the reason that Nvidia's results continue to dazzle. Image source: Getty Images. Nvidia's data center revenue grew 73% year over year in the recently announced fiscal first quarter of 2026, reaching $39 billion, while total sales increased to $44 billion, representing 69% growth. As shown below, Nvidia's revenue andcash flowgrowth over the last few years is nothing short of incredible.  NVDA Revenue (TTM)data byYCharts There is no indication that the growth won't continue in earnest. Nvidia expects $45 billion in sales for Q2 of fiscal 2026, representing a 50% year-over-year increase. The percentages decrease due to the laws of larger numbers; however, Nvidia will add $15 billion in total sales from Q2 of fiscal 2025 to Q2 of fiscal 2026 by achieving its target. Nvidia stock currently trades with a price-to-earnings ratio of 46, well below its three-year average of 80. This drops to just 34 on a forward basis. While the exponential gains of the last few years may be over, Nvidia stock will still likely outpace the market, given the high demand for its products and its superior growth rate. Pop quiz, investors. What is the biggest challenge that AI faces? If you said managing, processing, and securing data, you are correct! In fact, as shown below, all of the largest challenges center around data in one form or another. Statista This means that cloud providers, like Amazon Web Services (AWS), the largest cloud services provider on Earth, have massive growth runways as AI adopters seek data services. AWS is the straw that stirs Amazon's drink, as it accounts for the majority of its profits. In Q1, AWS provided 63% of Amazon's $18.4 billion in operating profits. Sales reached $29 billion, driven by robust 17% year-over-year growth, and the operating margin was impressive at 39%, demonstrating that AWS has excellent pricing power. Amazon's other revenue streams also posted strong results. Digital advertising stood out with 19% year-over-year growth to $14 billion in Q1 sales. Overall, Amazon achieved 9% total sales growth, with total revenue reaching $156 billion. Net income increased to $17 billion from $10 billion in the same period last year. The results are simply too good to be ignored. Amazon stock is historically undervalued, despite its stock price being on a general upward trajectory, as shown below.

        "content": "Jensen Huang, the CEO of chipmaking giant Nvidia (NVDA), has said that the UK is in a \"Goldilocks\" situation when it comes to artificial intelligence (AI). Huang made the comments on a panel with UK prime minister Keir Starmer and minister for investment Poppy Gustafsson at the start of London Tech Week on Monday morning. When asked by Gustafsson how the UK could create an AI ecosystem and drive the opportunities presented by the technology, Huang said that the country was in a \"goldilocks circumstance\". He was implying that the UK had the right ingredients to be successful with AI. Huang said the UK has \"one of the richest AI communities anywhere on the planet\", adding that it has the \"best universities, amazing start-ups and incredible thinkers in computer science\". London-founded AI research lab DeepMind, which is also headquartered in the UK capital and is now owned by Google (GOOG,GOOGL), was among the start-ups highlighted by Huang. Autonomous driving systems start-up Wayve, AI video generation company Synthesia and AI voice generator start-up ElevenLabs, were among the other names Huang mentioned. In addition, Huang said the UK has the \"third largest AI venture capital (VC) investment anywhere in the world\". \"And so between these two ideas that you're rich with computer scientists, it's a fantastic place for VCs to invest, the ecosystem is really perfect for takeoff,\" he said.

It will naturally enable all of the rich ecosystem of researchers here to be able to do their life's work and I think it's just such an incredible, incredible place to invest: I'm gonna invest here. \"The UK is such a great place to invest because of all the things I've just said \u2013 we're gonna start our AI lab that you mentioned, prime minister, and we're going to partner with the UK to upskill the ecosystem of developers into AI.\" In addition to ramping up the UK's computing capacity, Starmer unveiled a government partnership with 11 major companies to train 7.5 million workers in AI by 2030. The prime minister also shared the government's plans to embed learning around AI in the education system with a \"tech-first training programme\". He said that this \u00a3185m investment would train up to a million young people in tech skills. Read more: Will the UK spending review lead to autumn tax rises?

        "content": "June 9 -A multi-billion-dollar plan to build a massiveAI datacenter hub in the UAE using U.S. technology remains far from finalized due to unresolved security concerns, according to a Friday report by Reuters. The project, dubbed Stargate UAE, brings together Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), OpenAI, Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), SoftBank Group (SFTBY) and Abu Dhabi's G42 to construct a 1-gigawatt compute cluster. In reality, the entire 10-square-mile site will eventually host up to 5 gigawatts worth of data centers. The first 200-megawatt phase of Stargate UAE is slated to go live in 2026, with subsequent capacity added in stages. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. U.S. officials have yet to settle on security conditions for exporting advanced AI chips or agree on enforcement measures, leaving the deal's framework in limbo. Under the U.S.-UAE AI Acceleration Partnership, Abu Dhabi pledged to align its security protocols with Washington's standards. However, lingering concerns about the UAE's close ties to China and past use of Huawei technology continue to stall progress. Despite the delays, participants view Stargate UAE as a strategic move to anchor high-performance compute in the Middle East. G42 executives have emphasized that, once fully operational, the 5 gigawatts of compute capacity will support both local AI research and global cloud services. Yet until Washington finalizes export controls and enforcement guidelines, construction timelines beyond the initial 200 megawatts remain uncertain. Based on the one year price targets offered by 52 analysts, the average target price for NVIDIA Corp is $174.71 with a high estimate of $372.87 and a low estimate of $100.00. The average target implies a upside of +23.28% from the current price of $141.72.

        "header": "Interest in Annuities Is Soaring: Understanding the 2025 Trend",
        "content": "The annuity industry is having a moment. After years of mixed opinions and confusion around how they work, annuities surged in popularity in recent years, with total U.S. sales reaching a record-high $434.1 billion in 2024\u2014a 13% increase from 2023. This trend has continued through 2025, fueled by a wave of aging Americans seeking stability in an uncertain economic environment. Let\u2019s explore the specific factors contributing to this sustained interest, the challenges still facing the industry, and what the future may hold for annuities as a modern retirement tool. Annuitiesare financial contracts you can purchase from insurance companies that provide a steady stream of payments, typically for retirement. In exchange for a lump sum or a series of contributions, annuities can offer guaranteed income, either for a set number of years or for the rest of your life. That guaranteed income stream is an annuity\u2019s primary appeal, acting as a form of insurance againstoutliving your retirement savings\u2014a growing concern in 2025. Around 64% of Americans say they\u2019re more worried about running out of money in retirement than they are about dying. The two main ways annuities differ are in the timing and predictability of their payments. Here are the primary options: These categories combine to create distinctannuity types, such as fixed-rate deferred or immediate variable annuities. The American annuity market has experienced a resurgence in recent years. From 2022 to 2024, total U.S. annuity sales exceeded $1.1 trillion, marking three straight years of record-breaking growth.In 2024 alone, annuity sales reached $434.1 billion\u2014a 13% year-over-year increase\u2014according to the Life Insurance Marketing and Research Association\u2019s (LIMRA) U.S. Individual Sales Survey, which covers 92% of the market. Although 2025 may see a modest pullback, the industry outlook remains strong. LIMRA projects annuity sales between $364\u2013$410 billion this year, with the dip largely tied to declining short-term interest rates. The organization expects sales to stabilize in the following years, with forecasts of $340\u2013$398 billion in 2026 and $326\u2013$395 billion in 2027. One of the primary factors behind this is America\u2019saging population. Between 2023 and 2027, the number of Americans aged 65 and older is projected to increase by 7.5 million. LIMRA expects that demographic shift\u2014combined with increased sales fromfixed-rate deferred annuitiesexiting theircontingent deferred sales charge(CDSC) periods\u2014to drive demand. While total annuity sales have grown significantly in recent years, much of the increase has been concentrated in specific products. In 2023, fixed-rate deferred annuities (FRDs) were the primary growth driver. Annual FRD sales reached a record $164.9 billion, up 46% from 2022. However, as interest rates began to fall in 2024, investors increasingly turned to products offering greater growth potential, likefixed indexed annuities(FIAs) andregistered index-linked annuities(RILAs). Both categories hit record highs in 2024, with FIA sales rising 31% to $125.5 billion and RILAs climbing 37% to $65.2 billion. The competitive landscape is similarly concentrated, with the top 20 providers accounting for roughly 73% of the total industry sales in 2024. Here are the top five brands, which were responsible for around 30% of all sales: \u201cEach major annuity provider brings unique strengths,\u201d said Jordan Gilberti, CFP, founder ofSage Wealth Group. \u201cSome focus on innovative product features, while others emphasize customer service and financial stability. Understanding these differences is crucial for matching clients with the right annuity solutions.\u201d \u201cTwo of my preferred insurance companies today are MassMutual and Midland National,\u201d said Zack Swad, CFP, CWS, founder ofSwad Wealth Management. \u201cBoth have strong financial strength ratings fromAM Best, long-standing reputations, and offer competitive annuity products tailored for fee-only advisors. Their offerings tend to be transparent and fairly easy to understand.\u201d Persistent market swings have made many retirees and near-retirees uneasy about relying too heavily on stocks. In 2022, the S&P 500 fell 19.4%\u2014its worst annual performance since 2008.That downturn marked an inflection point, as many investors began turning to annuities for a more stable and predictable source of retirement income. Fast forward to 2025, and the volatility hasn\u2019t subsided. Global trade tensions, fueled by fear over the Trump administration\u2019stariff proposals, continue to rattle the markets. A series of sharp selloffs in early 2025, including a 748-point single-day drop in theDow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), have only deepened investor anxiety. \u201cThe shift towards annuities reflects a broader desire for financial security,\u201d said Gilberti. \u201cAs people live longer and face uncertain markets/economic conditions, the appeal of a reliable income stream becomes more pronounced.\u201d After a decade of relatively stable prices,inflationbegan to accelerate in 2021, peaking at roughly 9.1% in June 2022. Based on theConsumer Price Index (CPI), the inflation rate didn\u2019t drop back below 5% until April 2023. Inflation has since cooled, reaching a rate of 2.3% in April 2025, but remains stubbornly above the Federal Reserve\u2019s long-term 2% target.For many, annuities offer a potential hedge against inflation. Specifically,inflation-protected annuities (IPA)index their payments to theinflation rate, guaranteeing arate of returnthat keeps up with rising prices, though there may be a cap. Interest rates rose rapidly from 2022 through 2023. The Federal Reserve raised the federal funds target rate from near zero to a range of 5.25% to 5.50%, where it remained until September 2024. While rates have since dipped slightly, the target rate still sits at a range of 4.25% to 4.5%\u2014well above the historically low levels of the 2010s. This rate environment has enabled insurers to offer higher yields on fixed annuities, increasing their appeal. For example, annuity rates in theThrift Savings Plan (TSP)climbed from 1.95% in January 2022 to 5.2% by December 2023. As of June 2025, they remain elevated at 4.825%. \u201cI believe the uptick in demand is largely due to rising interest rates,\u201d said Swad. \u201cThese have made annuities more attractive than they've been in over a decade.\u201d In the private market, annuity rates can be even more competitive. As of June 4, 2025, New York Life\u2019s guaranteed lifetime income annuity offers returns as high as 7.36% for 65-year-old individuals. Technology is steadily modernizing the annuity industry, improving transparency, streamlining operations, and enhancing the customer experience. Providers are now usingartificial intelligence (AI)to personalize annuity recommendations, automate underwriting, and provide better support through chatbots. Blockchainis also emerging as a powerful tool for building trust in long-term financial contracts. By recording annuity agreements on a decentralized digital ledger, providers ensure contract terms are unchangeable and fully transparent to both parties.Smart contracts\u2014like those powered byEthereum\u2014can also streamline payouts by automatically executing them in line with predefined terms. As mentioned previously, demographics are a major force behind the expected long-term growth in the annuity market. The 7.5 million net increase in Americans aged 65 and older over the next several years is expected to create sustained demand for retirement income products like annuities. In 2025, an average of more than 11,200 Americans are projected to turn 65 every day, adding up to roughly $4.1 million per year. This milestone has been dubbed America\u2019s \"Peak 65 Zone\"\u2014the biggest wave of new retirees in U.S. history.It sets a record that will hold for roughly 20 years, until the millennial generation starts reaching retirement age. Despite growing demand, the annuity market isn\u2019t without its share of headwinds in 2025. Chief among them is the decline in interest rates compared to 2023, which has already reduced the appeal of fixed-rate products. The Federal Reserve appears to be in aholding patternfor now, but additional cuts later this year could further dampen annuity yields. More fundamentally, the annuity industry continues to grapple with the issue of its own complexity. While newer products often offer greater transparency, the category as a whole has long been associated withlayered fees, intricate terms, and confusing payout structures. These can overwhelm consumers and make product comparisons difficult. According to the 2024 Policygenius Annuities Literacy Survey, only 19% of American adults could correctly define an annuity. Just 5% knew both what it was and when it might be useful. Liquidityrestrictions are another common concern. Many annuities come withsurrender chargesor penalties for withdrawing your money before payments begin. Even if you\u2019re looking for guaranteed income, the idea of giving up control of your principal can be an intimidating prospect. \u201cSome annuities are difficult to understand and come with long surrender periods that tie up funds,\u201d said Swad. \u201cFor people who value liquidity and flexibility, that can be a dealbreaker.\u201d Many advisors suggest that thebest age to buy an annuityis between 50 and 70, when you\u2019re approaching retirement and seeking income stability. However, the ideal timing depends on various factors, including your financial circumstances, risk tolerance, and longevity prospects. Annuities can provide a reliable income stream, helping reduce the risk of outliving your savings. They can help complement riskier assets like stocks, especially if you want additional guaranteed income beyond what you expect from Social Security or pensions. Annuities can come with high fees, limited liquidity, and potentially lower returns than other investments. Some types, like variable annuities, can even expose you to market losses. Since they\u2019re backed by an insurance company, there\u2019s also a risk of loss if the provider becomes insolvent, making financial strength ratings key considerations. Annuities have seen a resurgence in popularity over recent years, driven by increased demand for reliable income streams in retirement. Market volatility, elevated interest rates, and persistent inflation have all contributed to the trend. Declining interest rates may lessen demand in 2025, but the long-term outlook for the industry remains strong. America\u2019s aging population means there will be more retirees seeking financial security, and continued innovation\u2014such as through AI and blockchain technologies\u2014could make annuities increasingly accessible and appealing to them.",

        "header": "How to Choose the Best Annuity for Your Retirement Needs",
        "content": "Annuities are experiencing a resurgence as retirees seekstable income sourcesdue to factors like stock market volatility and economic uncertainty. From 2022 through 2024, the U.S. annuity industry saw three consecutive years of record-breaking sales, totaling over $1.1 trillion. However,annuity contractsremain famously complex, with restrictions that can be costly if you don\u2019t do your due diligence. Here\u2019s what you should know before committing, including the different annuity types, their pros and cons, and how to assess which option fits your needs. Annuitiesare insurance contracts designed to provide asteady stream of income, typically in retirement. You fund them with a lump sum or series of premiums, and in return, an insurer makes regular payouts to you for a predetermined period, which can be as long as the rest of your life. The primary purpose of annuities in retirement planning is to help managelongevity risk\u2014the possibility of outliving your savings. \u201cWith the AI era upon us, medical advancements could potentially result in much longer lifespans than previously thought,\u201d said Marcel Miu, CFA, CFP, founder ofSimplify Wealth Planning. Annuities can also supplement otherfixed incomesources, such asSocial Securitybenefits,pensions, or bonds. For many retirees, some amount of predictable income can provide peace of mind. Fixed annuitiesprovide payouts that remain the same regardless of market fluctuations. Their issuers invest your premiums in conservative assets\u2014such as high-quality corporate andgovernment bonds\u2014and pay you a static amount on a regular schedule, typically monthly. This low-risk investment approach allows insurers to guarantee your recurring payments, offering predictability. However, fixed annuities often provide lower returns than other investments, and their payouts may struggle to keep pace with inflation. Inflation-protected annuities (IPA)increase your payments regularly to mitigate the effects of inflation\u2014for a price. A common variation of the fixed annuity is the fixed indexed annuity (FIA), also called anindexed annuity. While FIAs protect your principal and offer a guaranteed minimum return, a portion of your interest is also linked to the performance of a market index, like theS&P 500. If the index performs well, your interest may increase, giving you the potential for higher returns. In contrast to fixed annuities,variable annuitiesinvest your premiums in market-based assets, such asmutual funds. As a result, your future payouts and the value of your account will depend on how these underlying investments perform. While this introducesmarket riskand the potential for losses, it also means variable annuities provide greater growth potential than fixed annuities. As a result, they may appeal to investors with a higherrisk toleranceor a longertime horizon, but they come with added complexity. Beyond the risk of losses, a major drawback of variable annuities is their tendency to carry higher fees than other annuity types. \u201cI generally avoid variable annuities due to their high costs, even though they offer a range of investment options,\u201d said Zach Swad, CFP, CWS, founder ofSwad Wealth Management. Immediate annuities\u2014available in fixed and variable forms\u2014are characterized by apayout phasethat starts soon after purchase, generally within one year.You typically fund immediate annuities with alump-sum payment. These contracts can be ideal for retirees or near-retirees who want to quickly convert a portion of their savings into a reliable stream of income. Deferred annuitiesdon\u2019t begin payouts for a potentially years-long period known as anaccumulation period, during which your invested premiums growtax-deferred. Like immediate annuities, deferred annuities can offer fixed or variable returns. Because you can fund deferred annuities over an extended period, they may be a more suitable vehicle for building long-term retirement savings than immediate annuities. Selecting the right annuity begins with self-analysis. \u201cMost people approach annuities backward,\u201d said Miu. \u201cThey focus solely on the product rather than how it fits into their overall plan. That's like choosing kitchen appliances before designing the house.\u201d \u201cUnderstanding personal financial goals and risk appetite is essential,\u201d said Jordan Gilberti, CFP, founder ofSage Wealth Group. \u201cAnnuities can provide peace of mind, but they must fit within the broader context of one's retirement plan.\u201d Are you looking for predictable income to cover core living expenses, or are you comfortable accepting some market risk in exchange for higher growth potential? This is often greatly informed by how an annuity fits in with your other retirement assets and income streams. \u201cEmotional risk tolerance also matters,\u201d said Swad. \u201cIf someone historically sold out during events like the 2008 crisis or COVID volatility, that's a sign they may need to assess how much fluctuation they can truly stomach before hitting the panic button.\u201d Income timing needs are also important to consider, as they\u2019ll typically guide you toward either an immediate or deferred contract. \u201cImmediate annuities are best suited for clients who need guaranteed lifetime income now\u2014especially if their essential expenses aren't fully covered by existing sources, like Social Security or a pension,\u201d said Swad. For example, if you need $5,000 per month in fixed income right away and only receive $3,000 from Social Security, you might use an immediate annuity to generate the remaining $2,000.  \u201cDeferred income annuities that eventually convert to lifetime income (e.g., starting in 5\u201310 years), can also be used to lock in future income needs,\u201d said Swad. For example, say you\u2019re a decade out from retirement and your projected Social Security benefits fall short of your estimated living expenses in retirement. You might purchase a deferred annuity that starts paying out in a decade to make up for the expected shortfall. Deferred annuities can also help address intermediate-term needs. \u201cFor instance,\u201d said Swad, \u201cif a client won't begin Social Security for three years and needs $60,000 per year to bridge that gap, I may build a ladder using bonds and annuities that can serve that purpose. We could buy a one-year bond, a two-year bond, and a three-year fixed annuity, each with $60,000 in principal invested.\u201d Annuities allow for countless riders, opening up many other critical decisions. One of the most important is payment duration: whether you want to spread your annuity income over a set period or the rest of your life. \u201cMost income annuities I use are structured for lifetime income, which helps protect against longevity risk,\u201d said Swad. \u201cSome do offer shorter terms, but they're less common and often not as beneficial for long-term retirement planning.\u201d Spousal coverage is another major consideration, as it determines what happens when you pass away. \u201cSpousal coverage is critical in many cases,\u201d said Swad. \u201cIf the surviving spouse would still need income, choosing a joint-life payout ensures the income continues for the remainder of both lives.\u201d Inflation protectionis also worth considering, though it can be misunderstood. \u201cWhile some annuities offer a fixed percentage increase each year (e.g., 2% or 3%), it's usually not tied to theCPIor an actual inflation index,\u201d said Swad. \u201cThese riders also often come with a significantly reduced initial payout.\u201d The primary appeal of an annuity lies in its promise of stability. \u201cIn 2025, annuities are increasingly integral toretirement strategiesfor clients seeking predictable income,\u201d said Gilberti. \u201cWith market fluctuations and economic uncertainties, annuities offer a sense of security that many retirees find appealing.\u201d Annuities are also highly customizable, allowing you to tailor their income streams to fill specific gaps in your retirement plan\u2014whether that\u2019s a long-term need for fixed income or a short-term bridge until you start drawing Social Security. However, annuities also come with significant downsides, including non-transparent and restrictive fees\u2014such assurrender charges\u2014that can trap consumers. \u201cWhile annuities offer stability, their complexity and potential penalties for early withdrawal necessitate a clear understanding,\u201d said Gilberti. If you can navigate their twists and turns, annuities can be beneficial\u2014as long as you align them to your personal finances. \u201cAnnuities aren't magic potions, but they're not boogeymen either,\u201d said Miu. \u201cThe right one, used the right way, can be a valuable piece of your financial picture.\u201d Some annuities offer inflation protection, which typically increases your payments each year by a set percentage. However, these increases aren\u2019t always tied to actual inflation rates, so your payments may not keep up with real-world price changes. Additionally, inflation protection isn\u2019t free and may result in lower initial payouts or higher premiums. When an annuity holder passes away, the insurer generally keeps any remaining value unless the contract includes a death benefit or a joint-life payout. When these features are present, the annuity may go to a beneficiary or the surviving spouse instead. Most annuities impose steep surrender charges for early withdrawals, especially within the earlier years of the contract.However, these penalties often decrease over time. For example, they may start at 7% and drop by 1% each year until withdrawals become penalty-free. Annuities can play a valuable role in your retirement strategy, offering stability, customizable income streams, and protection against longevity risk. However, their complexity, fees, and restrictions require careful consideration. Before committing, take stock of your unique financial situation, including your income needs, risk tolerance, and goals. When you\u2019re ready to start comparing options, a qualified financial advisor can help you understand contract terms and ensure the annuity you choose complements the rest of your retirement plan.",

        "content": "As retirement draws closer, one of the most important decisions you\u2019ll face is how to transform your existing nest egg into areliable and sustainable income source. While Social Security or other fixed income may cover some expenses, most retirees will need more. A personalized income strategy might leverage a diverse pool of resources, including an annuity, retirement accounts, bonds, and equities\u2014but how do you decide what belongs in your portfolio? Let\u2019s take a look at how annuities stack up against other retirement income sources. Anannuityis a financial product issued by an insurance company. It is intended to provide retirees with a stream of income, usually guaranteed for life, in exchange for an upfront lump-sum premium or series of payments. Annuities are designed to help protect against the risk of outliving your money, offering retirees a source of steady, fixed income\u2014and the predictability that comes with it. Some of the most common types of annuities include: Those nearing retirement generally choose to purchase an annuity because of theguaranteed fixed income. More specifically, retirees are attracted to the promise of lifetime income, regardless of how long they live or how the markets perform. Annuities can be a valuable offering for those without pensions (as is the case for most private sector workers) or who are concerned about the sustainability of their other retirement resources. Additionally, annuities grow tax-deferred, meaning you don\u2019t pay taxes on earnings until you begin receiving payouts. This tax advantage enables the funds to continue growing uninterrupted, without increasing your tax bill during your working years. Annuities are complex financial products withlayered feesfor riders, administrative costs, and investment management (though the latter may be more prevalent in variable annuities). Their primary purpose is to protect against the risk of outliving your money. They create a safety net for retirees, but that security and stability come with drawbacks. Namely, earnings within an annuity are limited. While some can benefit from positive market performance, the upside potential is typically capped. Keep in mind, there\u2019s often a \u201cfloor\u201d in place as well to provide downside protection. Should the market drop, your losses would be limited. You may also find an annuity to be less liquid than other sources of retirement income. Many contracts impose penalties for early withdrawals, meaning you may have to paysurrender chargesif you need access to your money earlier than anticipated. While an annuity is one of the few options available to provide guaranteed income for life, it\u2019s not your only resource for retirement. Let\u2019s take a look at a few other common investment vehicles and tools for building out a diversified retirement income strategy. A401(k)is an employer-sponsored tax-advantaged retirement account. In a traditional 401(k), contributions are made pre-tax, meaning they reduce your taxable income for the year. A Roth 401(k) is funded with after-tax dollars and won\u2019t lower your tax bill. Eligible withdrawals in retirementfd may, however, be tax-free. In both cases, earnings in the account grow tax-deferred. Employers commonly incentivize employees to contribute to the plan by offeringemployer matching. For every dollar or percentage of salary you contribute, your employer will match it (up to a certain amount or percentage). 401(k) contribution limits are relatively high compared to other types of retirement accounts, and they\u2019re adjusted each year for inflation. With a traditional pre-tax account, you will be required to start taking distributions (called \u201crequired minimum distributions\u201d) beginning at age 73. If you aren\u2019t offered a 401(k) or similar employer-sponsored retirement plan, you may be eligible to contribute to anindividual retirement account (IRA). These come in a few common varieties, including traditional, Roth, and SEP IRAs. Traditional IRAs function similarly to traditional 401(k)s. Contributions are tax-deductible, earnings grow tax-deferred, and withdrawals are subject toordinary income tax. Like a 401(k), a traditional IRA is also subject to required minimum distributions. Roth IRAs are similar to Roth 401(k)s. Again, they\u2019re funded with after-tax dollars, earnings grow tax-deferred, and qualified withdrawals are tax-free. Roth IRAs are not subject to required distributions. Asimplified employee pension (SEP) IRAis specifically designed for sole proprietors and small business owners. Bonds, especiallyU.S. Treasury bondsand high-quality corporate bonds, are often used in a retirement portfolio to help generate steady, predictable income for retirees. When you purchase a bond as an investor, you\u2019re essentially lending money to the borrower in exchange for regular interest payments and the promise that your initial investment will be returned once the bond reaches maturity. Bonds are generally considered a less risky investment than stocks and can serve as a stable income source in retirement. However, interest rate fluctuations can impact bond performance, especially if you buy or sell on the secondary bond market. Financial institutions and banks offer investorscertificates of deposit (CDs), which are savings products that pay a fixed interest rate for a set term. Typically, a CD will range from a few months to several years. They\u2019re considered one of the most conservative investment vehicles available and are insured by the FDIC for up to $250,000 per depositor, per institution. CDs may be more liquid than annuities in some cases, but early withdrawals are still typically penalized (similar to annuities). CDs are also not ideal for growth, since they offer low returns compared to other investment vehicles. They\u2019re most often used by retirees looking for a short-term, low-risk place to park cash. Retirement income funds (RIFs)are a type of mutual fund specifically designed to provide a retiree with consistent income during retirement. Usually including a mix of stocks and bonds, these accounts are actively managed in order to balance an investor\u2019s growth and income needs. Compared to annuities, RIFs offer more liquidity and potential for market growth, but they don\u2019t provide guaranteed payments. Their performance depends on market conditions, which means they may be more suitable for retirees willing to take on greatermarket riskin retirement. Some retirees choose to invest individend-paying stocksas a way to generate income while maintaining exposure to the stock market. These dividends can supplement Social Security or other income sources (such as annuities) and may offer higher returns than fixed-income investments. Most retirement income strategies include multiple tools and investment vehicles. It\u2019s not uncommon for retirees to blend annuities or guaranteed income sources with other income-generating assets to create adiversified retirement plan. Let\u2019s take a closer look at how annuities compare to other common income sources. Generally speaking, the \u201csafer\u201d an investment vehicle is, the lower its growth potential. For this reason, investors tend to build portfolios with a diverse set of assets\u2014equity, bonds, cash, and guaranteed income (like annuities). As you near retirement, striking the right balance between achieving a sustainable rate of return and mitigating risk becomes increasingly important. This is how you will help ensure your wealth outlasts your lifetime. On the scale of risky to conservative, annuities are generally considered a safer option. They help protect againstlongevity risk(the risk of outliving your savings) by providing guaranteed income, often for life. Fixed annuities in particular offer a predictable stream of payments, which can be comforting for retirees who value consistency and stability. However, that safety comes at a cost: fixed annuities typically offer lower returns than market-based investments, and variable or indexed annuities with growth potential often include caps, participation rates, or higher fees that limit the upside. By comparison, options like 401(k)s, IRAs, dividend-paying stocks, and retirement income funds are subject to market volatility. Their rate of return can fluctuate over time (sometimes drastically, depending on market conditions). With higher risk, however, comes higher growth potential. For this reason, equities tend to outperform fixed-income products like annuities and bonds over the long term. Bonds and CDs, on the other hand, are generally lower risk and offer lower return potential compared to stocks\u2014but they do generate interest income. They don\u2019t, however, come with the guarantees that most annuities offer, and retirees may struggle to achieve bond returns that keep pace with rising inflation. Once you invest in an annuity, your funds are typically locked up for a predetermined period (known as the surrender period). If you withdraw money early, you may face steep surrender charges, in addition to potential tax penalties. While some contracts offer limited annual withdrawals (often 10% of the contract value), they\u2019re still less flexible than traditional brokerage accounts. Once you reach age 59\u00bd, you\u2019ll be able to make withdrawals without penalty from your retirement accounts (including your 401(k) and IRA). While you must withdraw the required minimum distributions starting at age 73 from traditional pre-tax accounts, you can always withdraw more if needed. Bonds can be bought and sold on the secondary bond market at any time\u2014making them relatively liquid if held in a brokerage account.CDs, however, are comparatively less liquid since you\u2019ll be dinged with an early withdrawal penalty for trying to cash out before the maturity date. If liquidity is a key concern heading into retirement, annuities may not be your most flexible option. You\u2019ll likely need to incorporate more accessible assets and investment tools into your retirement income strategy alongside annuities to address your liquidity needs. Most annuities grow tax-deferred, meaning you won\u2019t owe taxes on earnings until you begin receiving payments. When you do take withdrawals, the taxable portion is treated as ordinary income. For this reason, annuities can help investors defer some of theirtax liabilityuntil retirement. This can be especially beneficial if you believe you\u2019ll be in a lower tax bracket later in life. Unlike a traditional 401(k) or IRA, your annuity premiums are made with after-tax dollars (unless purchased through a qualified retirement plan). While you don\u2019t receive any type of immediate tax deduction for your contribution, a portion of your income stream\u2014the return of principal\u2014isn\u2019t taxed once you begin receiving payments. Bonds and dividend-paying stocks are generally held intaxable brokerage accounts, though they may be included in your IRA or 401(k) as well. Any interest or dividends earned typically do add to your taxable income each year, though qualified dividends may benefit from long-term capital gains tax rates. The interest earned within a CD is also taxed annually, unless the CD is held in a tax-advantaged account. Annuities provide retirees with tax-deferred growth, and payouts are taxed as ordinary income. Knowing the tax liability of your payouts in retirement can be helpful, especially as you balance the tax treatment of your other income sources. There\u2019s no \u201cright answer\u201d when it comes to choosing annuities or building out your full retirement income strategy. You\u2019ll need to consider the longevity of your other resources, anticipated expenses, tax concerns, and general goals for retirement. Annuities can be a strong fit for some retirees, but not necessarily for everyone. Consider what your top priority is when preparing for retirement. Are you most focused on creating stable income, or are you comfortable taking on some risk for the possibility of greater growth? If you\u2019d feel most comfortable creating a predictable income stream that you can\u2019t outlive, an annuity could make sense. The guaranteed lifetime income can bring retirees some peace of mind. Annuities may also be appropriate for retirees who are concerned about longevity risk or those who expect to live well into their 80s or 90s (even past 100). That being said, the payout from an annuity may not be enough to cover all your financial obligations in retirement. You may need to find other opportunities to fill in the gaps, which is where the other retirement income sources can come in handy. Broader economic trends can be an important factor in deciding whether an annuity makes sense within your portfolio. Annuity payouts are often tied to interest rates\u2014the higher the current rate environment, the more favorable the annuity\u2019s income stream is likely to be.In periods of rising or high interest rates, annuities tend to offer better value, especially fixed annuities. The opposite is true as well. When interest rates are low, annuity payouts may shrink\u2014which could make other investment vehicles more appealing. Bonds and dividend-paying stocks, for example, may offer comparatively better yields in those environments, particularly if you\u2019re willing to accept more volatility. When interest rates are high, providers can offer more attractive payout rates for annuities. In a high-rate environment, annuities (especially fixed annuities) may be an appealing option for generating guaranteed income. In low-rate environments, annuity providers may offer less favorable payout rates, making them a less attractive retirement income option. Annuity payouts or withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income. Only the earnings portion of the payout is taxed since the principal amount is typically returned tax-free. This differs from tax-advantaged accounts like traditional IRAs or 401(k)s, where all withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income (including principal contributions and earnings). If you have a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k), however, qualified withdrawals are tax-free. And unlike stocks or bonds in a taxable brokerage account, annuity earnings grow tax-deferred until distributions begin. Yes, annuities can offer a guaranteed fixed-income component to your diversified income strategy. Retirees commonly use annuities to cover essential expenses and supplement their income with other investment vehicles like IRAs, 401(k)s, bonds, and dividend-paying investments. Annuities are a common income source for retirees looking to boost their financial stability and security in retirement. While they can help cover essential expenses like your mortgage, insurance, utilities, and groceries, you will likely need to round out your retirement income strategy with other resources and investment vehicles. A diversified approach to retirement planning will enable you to address those risks that could impact your retirement\u2014market volatility, inflation, longevity, and more.",

        "content": "By 2040, about one in five Americans will be age 65 or older, up from roughly one in eight in 2000\u2014and from less than one in 20 in 1920.As the population ages, more people are seeking financial products that can provide stability in retirement. Annuities are an increasinly popular solution, but their complexity and fees can make them easy to misuse. Here\u2019s what you should know before committing your savings, including some of the most common pitfalls and how to avoid them. Typically used inretirement planning,annuitiesare financial products sold by insurance companies to provide reliable income. In exchange for alump sumor series of premium payments, the insurer makes regular payouts back to you over a predetermined period. Both the timing and consistency of your payouts can vary depending on thetype of annuityyou choose. The primary axes on which they fall include: Annuities can be overwhelmingly complex, with countless moving parts and decisions to make. It\u2019s easy to overlook just how many details matter\u2014payout timing and return profiles are just the beginning. You also need to determine whether you want features likeinflation protection,death benefits, orlong-term careriders. Each choice can dramatically affect your future income and flexibility. If you rush into an annuity without understanding these issues, you risk locking yourself into a long-term contract that doesn\u2019t fit your needs or goals, which could significantly impact your income and flexibility in retirement. Annuities come with amultitude of feesthat can undermine your returns. These may include annual management fees, administrative charges, and recurring expenses for any optional features or riders you add.If you don\u2019t pay close attention to the often opaque fee schedules before committing, you could end up with a lower stream of fixed income than you expected. One of the most significant potential expenses is thesurrender fee: a steep penalty for withdrawing some or all of your funds before a setsurrender period. These charges typically start high and gradually decrease over time. For example, an 8% penalty in your first year might decrease by 1% annually, meaning you could lose a substantial portion of your funds\u2014and the returns they would have generated\u2014if you withdraw money in the first decade. Each type of annuity offers different payout structures, features, andrisk-return profiles, so it\u2019s surprisingly easy to end up with a product that doesn\u2019t fit your needs. Before committing, consider your financial situation and broader retirement plan to ensure your chosen annuity aligns with yourrisk tolerance, other income sources, and timing needs. Choosing the right provider is just as important since your future income depends on the company\u2019s ability to honor its commitments. Research each provider\u2019s financial strength using independent rating agencies, likeAM Best, and review customer feedback to gauge the typical experience and quality of support. Reviews often skew negative because dissatisfied customers are more likely to leave comments. Focus on recurring patterns over individual complaints. Annuity payments are often at least partially fixed, which means their purchasing power may erode over time. You can help mitigate this risk withinflation-protected annuities (IPA), which increase your payments annually to help them keep up with rising prices. However, inflation protection doesn\u2019t always index your payments to the actual inflation rate. Many contracts boost payments by a set percentage each year, which may fall short if inflation spikes. Additionally, adding this feature isn\u2019t free and may result in lower initial payouts. Annuities growtax-deferred, so you don\u2019t pay taxes on your investment returns while your money remains in the account. However, the way you fund your account dictates the tax treatment of your premiums and eventual payouts. Aqualified annuityis funded with pre-tax dollars. This means your premiums may be tax-deductible, but payouts and withdrawals will be fully taxable as ordinary income. Anonqualified annuityis funded with post-tax dollars. Premiums aren\u2019t tax-deductible, but only the earnings portion of your payouts and withdrawals is taxable. The portion that represents your initial contributions comes out tax-free. When youinherit an annuity, you don\u2019t receive a step-up incost basislike you do with stocks or mutual funds. As a result, beneficiaries of annuities generally owe income tax on the same amount of earnings as the original policyholder. Failing to plan for what happens to your annuity after you pass away is one of the most costly mistakes you can make. If your contract doesn\u2019t include adeath benefitorjoint-life payoutfeature, your remaining annuity balance could go to the insurance company instead of supporting your loved ones. Adding these riders may cost you, but they offer potentially invaluable protection for your family\u2019s financial future. If you expect your spouse or other dependents to continue relying on this income after you\u2019re gone, review your contract carefully to ensure its survivor benefits align with your goals. It\u2019s easy to misunderstand what \u201cguaranteed\u201d means when it comes to annuities. Many products promise guaranteed income, but conditions apply, or the actual meaning is more nuanced. For example, \u201cguaranteed\u201d might only refer to the insurer\u2019s ability to make payments\u2014not to their amount. Be wary of sales pitches that sound too good to be true, especially those promising high returns with little risk. Some agents work on commission orrepresent one company, which can influence which products they recommend and how aggressively they promote them. Before purchasing an annuity, take the time to conduct thorough due diligence. Examine each contract carefully, paying close attention to fees, payout terms, and restrictions. Consider how each option fits into your broader retirement strategy. Someone seeking guaranteed lifetime income will need a very different product from someone trying to bridge a temporary gap untilSocial Security benefitsbegin. Don\u2019t overlook the importance of the insurer\u2019s financial strength either. Annuities are long-term contracts, and your income is only as reliable as your provider\u2019s ability to remainsolventfor its duration. Annuities are notoriously complex products. Despite their growing popularity, only around 19% of American adults are able to define them correctly.A qualified financial advisor can help you navigate potential contracts and ensure you choose a product that fits your retirement plan. Look for advisors who specialize in retirement planning and have experience with annuities. Don\u2019t hesitate to take advantage of free initial consultations to gauge their expertise, compensation structure, and communication style before committing. Whenever possible, seek annuity advice from afiduciary, who is legally required to put your best interest first, rather than pursuing commissions or personal gain. Even if you avoid all their common pitfalls, relying solely on annuities for retirement income can limit your portfolio\u2019s growth potential and make it vulnerable to inflation. Annuities can be a valuable part of yourfixed-incomeapproach, but they work best as one piece of a comprehensive retirement strategy. While guaranteed income streams can offer peace of mind, it\u2019s essential tobalance them with growth investments, like stocks and mutual funds.Diversifyingyour retirement income sources this way can help you maintain stability while addressing inflation andlongevity risks. Variable annuities carry market risk, so your returns can fluctuate with the performance of underlying investments and potentially result in losses. They also tend to have higher fees and expenses, which can further erode your returns. Start by assessing your income timing needs, risk tolerance, and other retirement savings to identify any gaps an annuity could fill. Consider working with a financial advisor who can help you evaluate your strategy and navigate complex contracts. Look for a fiduciary who is legally obligated to act in your best interest rather, rather than sell products for commissions. Ideally, choose someone who specializes in retirement planning and has proven experience with annuities. Annuities can offer valuable benefits in retirement, but their complexity, costs, and inflexibility make it easy to stumble into costly pitfalls. Before choosing an annuity, research your options, understand all fees and restrictions, and compare the financial strength and customer service of different providers. Make sure any annuity you consider fits into your broader retirement strategy, including your income needs, risk tolerance, and goals for your loved ones. A qualified financial advisor can help you avoid common mistakes.",

S&P Global, which produces the index, made no changes to the prestigious index in its June rebalancing. Bloombergsaid that analysts, including those at Bank of America and Barclays, had speculated that Robinhood would be added, sending the online trading platform's shares soaring to an all-time high Friday. Some intrigue was involved in the AppLovin story.CNBCreported in March thatshort sellerFuzzy Panda Research urged S&P Global to keep the mobile marketing platform out of the index. The network cited a letter from Fuzzy Panda calling AppLovin a \"nexus of a house of cards,\" and claimed it violated the app store policies of Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google and Apple (AAPL). Inclusion in the S&P 500 can be advantageous to stocks, because it exposes them to a wider group of investors who could become aware of those companies through an index. In addition, they can be put into variousindex fundsthat track S&P 500 stocks. Despite today's losses, shares of both Robinhood Markets and AppLovin are comfortably higher year-to-date. TradingView",

        "header": "Which Generation Is the Wealthiest in U.S History, and Why?",
        "content": "Baby Boomers (those born between 1946-1964, or aged 61-79 in 2025) stand out as thewealthiest generation in history. Born into the post-WWII expansion, they bought homes when prices were low, earned comfortable real wages, and piled into employer-sponsored retirement plans just as the stock market began its long bull run, benefitting from decades of rising asset prices. As of early 2025, Boomers controlled more than half of all U.S. household wealth as millions of them entered retirement. Their outsize net worth is no fluke: structural advantages that began in childhood and continued through their prime earning years made them, in inflation-adjusted terms, the richest generation the country has ever seen. Federal Reserve data show Boomers\u2019 share of wealth climbing in every economic cycle, topping out at 53% in 2021 before edging down slightly as they began to retire and transfer assets to their heirs. Theircombined net worth\u2014at $82 trillion\u2014more than double that ofGen-X($42 trillion) and four times that ofMillennials($16 trillion). American Boomers\u2019 collective trove is unprecedented: it equals roughly 2.8 times today\u2019s U.S. GDP, whereas the entire U.S. household sector in 1929 (at the height of the Roaring Twenties, just before theGreat Depression) was worth around 4.5 years of national total income and was dispersed more evenly across all ages.Even at the height of Victorian Britain, private wealth hovered near six years of national income, likewise spread more evenly across classes and generations. Indeed, no single cohort anywhere, at any time commanded so large a slice of the economic pie. The Silent Generation (born 1928-1945) certainly amassed wealth. Today its worth roughly $20 trillion, or 13% of the nation's wealth. But they never enjoyed the hefty balance sheets their children did. Wartime rationing, higher marginal tax rates (up to 92% on top incomes in the 1950s), and lower stock market participation limited capital growth. Boomers' grandparents, theGreatest Generation(1901-1927), saw wealth eroded by theGreat Depression, and spent many working years before the widespread adoption of retirement plans. Even though post-war wages rose, their life expectancy, and therefore their compounding horizon, was shorter on average, so that many drew down fewer assets, earlier. Crucially, for both the Silent and Greatest generations, real estate appreciation was modest during their prime years, and high mortgage rates in the early 1980s deterred later-life upsizing that could have boosted home equity values.As a result, many in these cohorts remained long-term homeowners in more modest properties, prioritizing financial security over more speculative gains. Millennials (born 1981-96) now hold roughly $16 trillion, or 10% of total U.S. wealth, up from just 2% in 2012.Their median net worth effectively doubled between 2019 and 2025 thanks to surging home prices and a stock market boom. While thetypical Millennial\u2019sinflation-adjusted assets are actually above what Gen-Xer's and Boomers owned at the same stage of life, largestudent-loan balances, high inflation and interest rates, delayed homeownership, and weaker real wage growth point toan overall shortfall. Gen-Z faces similar headwinds but are benefiting from a tighter labor market andhigher savings rates; their aggregate wealth rose by 22% in 2024, while Millennials' wealth rose only 12.75%. In order to catch up to the Boomers, younger cohorts will need to sustain above-average asset growth for many more years, overcome persistent affordability barriers, and see real wage gains outpace inflation and debt-servicing costs. Bridging the gap will also depend on continued strong labor markets\u2014but the rise of automation and generative AI is a wild card. When historians tally the richest cohort, Baby Boomers still top the list\u2014a generation uniquely positioned to ride post-war prosperity,tax-advantaged retirement vehicles, and unprecedented asset growth. Later cohorts may ultimately inherit more dollars, but absent similar tailwinds\u2014or major policy shifts\u2014they could be less likely to replicate Boomers\u2019 share of the pie.",

        "content": "Palantir Technologies Inc.PLTR has surged 69% year to date, eclipsing the industry\u2019s modest 13% average and outshining heavyweights likeNvidiaNVDA andOracleORCL.  Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Nvidia, a leading force in AI and graphics processing technology, has recorded a 6% gain so far this year. Similarly, Oracle, renowned for its enterprise software and cloud infrastructure services, has gained 5% year to date. In a macroeconomic landscape that has left many tech giants limping, Palantir\u2019s relentless rally stands out, but does this pace leave any meaningful upside for new investors? While Nvidia continues wrestling with cyclical demand and Oracle faces pressure on its cloud transition pace, Palantir is thriving by doubling down on artificial intelligence and data-centric enterprise software. The key question now: Is this AI darling still a buy, or has the market already priced in perfection? The backbone of Palantir\u2019s recent success is its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), which is rapidly transforming into the company\u2019s biggest commercial catalyst. U.S. commercial revenues skyrocketed 71% year over year and 19% sequentially in the first quarter of 2025, pushing the annual run rate past the $1 billion mark for the first time. Total contract value in this segment skyrocketed 239% YoY, with deal sizes proliferating, more than double the number of $1 million contracts closed compared to last year. The rising popularity of AIP bootcamps \u2014 short, targeted training sessions for enterprise AI deployment \u2014 is a major driver. These bootcamps reduce implementation timelines and showcase AIP\u2019s plug-and-play value, helping customers scale AI operations faster than ever. Palantir\u2019s flexible, modular sales model allows clients to start small with specific components, further lowering adoption friction. Combined with usage-based pricing, this strategy has broadened Palantir\u2019s reach in the U.S. commercial sector, making AI integration more accessible and scalable for new clients. As of March 31, 2025, Palantir boasted $5.4 billion in cash and no debt. This fortress balance sheet gives the company strategic flexibility to reinvest in growth without external financing pressures. Revenue growth remains robust\u2014first quarter sales soared 39.3% YoY. Deal momentum is equally encouraging with Palantir closing 139 deals of at least $1 million, 51 deals of at least $5 million and 31 deals of at least $10 million in the quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter 2025 EPS stands at 14 cents, up 55.6% from a year ago. Full-year earnings are projected to grow 44% in 2025 and 25% in 2026.  Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Sales estimates are equally bullish, with 38% expected growth in the second quarter and full-year top-line increases of 37% and 28% for 2025 and 2026, respectively.  Image Source: Zacks Investment Research   Despite its strong fundamentals, PLTR\u2019s valuation is hard to ignore. Its forward P/E ratio of 197 dwarfs the industry average of 40. This lofty premium reflects high expectations around future AI monetization and government contracts. While the growth story is compelling, the stock is priced for near-flawless execution, leaving minimal margin for error. Such a valuation exposes the stock to heightened volatility, especially if earnings or guidance falter in any quarter. Investors must weigh long-term promise against short-term risk. Palantir is proving itself as a real contender in AI-powered enterprise solutions. It has the momentum, the product-market fit, and the financial strength to keep growing. But the current price likely already reflects much of this optimism. While long-term investors should hold onto their positions, chasing the stock at these levels could prove risky. A better entry point may emerge after a pullback and valuation reset. PLTR currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Wall Street's Missing This AI Surgical Tech \u2014 You Don't Have To.Invest from $350. At the heart of Speedata's innovation is the analytics processing unit, a dedicated chip designed to accelerate data analytics from the silicon level up, TechCrunch reports. Unlike graphics processing units, which were originally designed for graphics and later adapted for data workloads, Speedata's analytics processing unit was engineered solely for analytics performance. \u201cOur APU is purpose-built for data processing and a single APU can replace racks of servers, delivering dramatically better performance,\u201d Speedata CEOAdi Gelvantold TechCrunch. \u201cWe aim at becoming the standard processor for data processing \u2014 just as GPUs became the default for AI training, we want APUs to be the default for data analytics across every database and analytics platform,\u201d he added. In one pharmaceutical test case, Speedata's APU completed a complex data workload in just 19 minutes, compared to 90 hours using conventional hardware. That represents a 280x speed improvement, highlighting the chip\u2019s potential to redefine industry benchmarks, TechCrunch says. Trending: Invest where it hurts \u2014 and help millions heal:Invest in Cytonics and help disrupt a $390B Big Pharma stronghold. The APU currently supports Apache Spark, with a product roadmap that includes integration across major analytics platforms. According to TechCrunch, Speedata aims to position its APU as the industry standard for processing analytics data, similar to how Nvidia\u2019s GPUs became essential in AI training. Speedata was founded in 2019 by six engineers, including early researchers of multi-threaded coarse-grained reconfigurable architecture, a breakthrough in programmable chip technology, TechCrunch reports. The founding team collaborated with application-specific integrated circuit specialists to design the chip from the ground up to solve analytics bottlenecks. Since its last funding round, Speedata has finalized the design and manufacturing of its first APU, moving from prototype simulations to production hardware in late 2024. The company is growing a pipeline of several large enterprise customers, although names have not been disclosed, TechCrunch says.

The startup is now expanding its go-to-market operations and growing its pipeline of enterprise clients eager to transition to faster and more efficient data processing, TechCrunch says. With $114 million in total funding, Speedata enters the race with both the hardware and investor backing to compete on a global scale. As data workloads continue to grow, Speedata's APU could reshape how businesses process information, potentially giving Nvidia its first serious competitor in data-specific chip architecture.

In this article, we will summarize the bulls\u2019 thesis on CRWV. CoreWeave, Inc. (CRWV)'s share was trading at $ 135.05 as of 5thJune. A scientist at a computer station, surrounded by a neural network of artificial intelligence code. CoreWeave\u2019s IPO has become one of the most closely watched in recent memory, offering a rare inside look into the infrastructure powering today\u2019s AI revolution. Originally founded as The Atlantic Crypto Corporation in 2017, the company pivoted from crypto mining to GPU-based cloud computing in 2022, just as demand for accelerated AI workloads began to explode. This well-timed shift has fueled explosive growth, with revenue soaring from $20 million in 2022 to $1.9 billion in 2024. CoreWeave now operates 32 data centers with over 250,000 Nvidia GPUs and more than 360 MW of active power, enabling it to serve top-tier clients such as OpenAI, Microsoft, Meta, Cohere, and Mistral. Its vertically integrated, Kubernetes-native platform is purpose-built for AI and delivers significantly higher performance, including up to 20% better Model FLOPS Utilization than legacy hyperscalers. Deeply tied to Nvidia\u2014its largest partner and shareholder with a 5% stake\u2014CoreWeave is often first to bring new GPU architectures like the H200 and GB200 NVL72 to market. While this relationship gives CoreWeave a competitive edge, it also presents concentration risks, as all current customer contracts mandate Nvidia hardware. Its business model centers on long-term, take-or-pay contracts averaging four years in duration, with 96% of 2024 revenue underpinned by these commitments. Customers prepay before CoreWeave installs capacity, derisking its growth. Now publicly listed, CoreWeave represents a compelling lens into the evolving AI infrastructure stack, combining purpose-built architecture, strategic alignment with Nvidia, and financial predictability, making it a cornerstone player in the AI economy. While CrowdStrike (CRWD) faces scrutiny over its elevated valuation and operational headwinds, CoreWeave (CRWV) offers a contrasting AI infrastructure bet rooted in explosive growth and Nvidia alignment. Both are central to the AI narrative\u2014CRWD on the security front and CRWV on the compute backbone\u2014but CoreWeave\u2019s take-or-pay contracts and visibility into future revenues provide a level of financial derisking not currently seen in CRWD\u2019s high-multiple, sentiment-sensitive profile. Previously, we covered abearish thesison CrowdStrike (CRWD) by Stock Whisperer on Substack in May 2025, pointing to bearish technicals, workforce reductions, and sentiment risk. While both highlight valuation concerns, Stock Whisperer adds near-term catalysts for caution, framing CRWD as vulnerable despite its long-term strength. Viewed together, CRWD and CRWV offer a study in contrasting AI exposure\u2014mature cybersecurity versus hyper-growth infra. CoreWeave, Inc. (CRWV) is not on our list of the30 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 36 hedge fund portfolios held CRWV at the end of the first quarter which was 0 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of CRWV as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

        "content": "NVIDIA shares added to recent gains Monday as CEO Jensen Huang set his sights on Europe. Huang, alongside U.K. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, kicked off London Tech Week on Monday. The event underscored a pivotal change in the U.K.\u2019s approach to technology, transforming it from a startup-centric domain to a matter of national policy. This strategic shift is supported by substantial investments in human capital, technological platforms, and strategic partnerships. By 11:40AM ET, NVIDIA\u2019s (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock was up 0.94% to $143.03. Huang emphasized AI\u2019s transformative potential across various sectors, predicting that \"every industry in the U.K. will be a tech industry\" due to AI. Starmer shared his administration\u2019s focus on integrating AI across all government departments to enhance the lives of U.K. citizens. He highlighted the U.K.\u2019s robust AI community, significant capital investments in AI, and the nation\u2019s commitment to becoming a hub for AI research and development. NVIDIA is set to further its investment in the U.K. by establishing an AI lab and collaborating with the government to advance the AI skills of local developers. These initiatives aim to create a self-reinforcing cycle where infrastructure investments spur more research, leading to breakthroughs and the growth of new companies. The collaboration between the U.K. government and NVIDIA extends to several key projects. The NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute will support a national AI skills initiative, training developers in advanced AI techniques. NVIDIA\u2019s new AI Technology Center in the U.K. will focus on research in embodied AI, material science, and earth system modeling. The U.K.\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority is incorporating NVIDIA technology into its innovation sandbox, and a partnership has been announced to accelerate AI-native 6G research. Additionally, the Isambard AI supercomputer, powered by NVIDIA, is expected to become operational this summer. A significant commitment from the U.K. government involves an investment of approximately \u00a31 billion in AI research compute by 2030, with funding beginning this year. This investment aligns with Prime Minister Starmer\u2019s vision of \"sovereign AI ambitions,\" which encompasses more than technology\u2014it\u2019s about encapsulating a nation\u2019s culture and heritage within AI development. NVIDIA\u2019s engagement in Europe is not limited to the U.K. In Sweden, Germany, and France, NVIDIA is collaborating with various partners to build national AI infrastructures and supercomputers, as well as establishing Europe\u2019s largest AI Campus in the Paris region. NVIDIA\u2019s dedication to the U.K. is evident, with a strong presence that includes over 1,700 Inception members and 500 employees. The company is partnering with leading U.K. enterprises to construct \u2019AI factories of the future\u2019 and is supporting a new wave of startups and scale-ups. The narrative will continue in Paris at NVIDIA GTC Paris, hosted live from VivaTech on June 11 at 11:00 a.m. CEST. Jensen Huang will deliver a keynote address, with a livestream available globally. The event is set to feature discussions on NVIDIA Blackwell, sovereign AI initiatives, and new regional partnerships, showcasing how European innovators are turning their AI ambitions into tangible infrastructure with NVIDIA\u2019s support.

        "content": "Tesla's (TSLA) stock is starting the week with a pair of downgrades after apublic spatbetween CEO Elon Musk and President Trump erupted last week. Analysts from Argus Research and Baird each cut their view on the electric vehicle maker, with Argus analyst Bill Selesky citing concerns that the EV maker's stock is \"currently trading on non-fundamental events,\" like Musk's relationship with the Trump administration. Baird analysts echoed the comments, saying the CEO's proximity to Trump was once seen as a positive after the election, but now \"adds uncertainty and fuels questions regarding brand damage.\" Both Argus and Baird analysts said that Tesla is still a favorite stock for the long term, but downgraded their ratings to \"hold\" for the time being. Aside from Argus and Baird, 10 of the analysts tracked by Visible Alpha call Tesla's stock a \"buy,\" while four rate it a \"hold,\" and four give it a \"sell.\" Their average price target of about $304 would suggest roughly 3% upside from Monday's intraday level. Shares were little changed in recent trading, just above $294. Tesla is expected tolaunch its robotaxi servicein Austin, Texas, as soon as this week,\u00a0which some bullish analysts have suggested could drive gains for the company's stock\u2014along with a more affordable model thatMusk has indicatedremains on track to be revealed this month. The Baird analysts said they expect about 6,000 robotaxis could be on the road by late next year, well below Musk's projected \"hundreds of thousands,\" anticipating the business could be \"harder (and likely less profitable) than the lofty expectations held by several investors.\" Tesla shares are down nearly 30% since the start of the year.",

        "content": "Trade talks between the US and China justgotinteresting again. Delegates met Monday in London, with Washington quietly signaling it might loosen some tech export rules but only if Beijing opens the gate on rare earth shipments. The discussions, led by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and China's Vice Premier He Lifeng, included Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick a move that suggests advanced tech exports are part of the conversation. Kevin Hassett from the White House economic team made it clear: Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) top-tier AI chips like H2O remain off-limits, but less advanced semiconductors could be up for negotiation. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. This isn't a new deal. It's an attempt to revive the shaky framework from Geneva, where both sides paused tariff hikes to cool the temperature. Since then, gaps in licensing clarity and rising political heat including visa crackdowns and sharp drops in trade have muddied the waters. Analysts like Josh Lipsky say the goal is simple: get both sides back to square one, but this time with real terms on paper. Monday's meeting could roll into Tuesday, and with a Trump-Xi call last week helping reboot the dialogue, investors are watching closely. Markets are already responding. Chinese stocks in Hong Kong surged into bull market territory, while US stocks wavered on cautious optimism. Meanwhile, China just posted its worst export numbers to the US in five years, and US manufacturers especially in the Midwest continue to feel the squeeze from tariff-driven uncertainty. The takeaway? London might not deliver a breakthrough, but it could reset the mood.

NYC Mayoral Candidates All Agree on Building More Housing. But Where? US Housing Agency Vulnerable to Fraud After DOGE Cuts, Documents Warn Trade talks between the US and China stretched on in London, with the US signaling a willingness to remove restrictions on some tech exports in exchange for assurances that China is easing limits on rare earth shipments. The meeting, which began Monday just after 1 p.m. local time, extended into the UK evening and may restart Tuesday if necessary. Bags of food from the upscale eatery Ottolenghi were brought into the building where negotiators were holding discussions. The Trump administration expects that \u201cafter the handshake\u201d in London, \u201cany export controls from the US will be eased and the rare earths will be released in volume\u201d by China, Kevin Hassett, head of the White House\u2019s National Economic Council, told CNBC. Hassett\u2019s comments from Washington were the clearest signal yet that the US is willing to offer such a concession, though he added that the US would stop short of including the most sophisticated US chips made by Nvidia Corp. used to power artificial intelligence. Specifically, the Trump administration is prepared to remove a recent spate of measures targeting chip design software, jet engine parts, chemicals and nuclear materials, people familiar with the matter said. Many of those actions were taken in the past few weeks as tensions flared between the US and China. \u201cThe very, very high-end Nvidia stuff is not what I\u2019m talking about,\u201d Hassett said, adding that restrictions would not be lifted on the Nvidia H2O chips that are used to train AI services. \u201cI\u2019m talking about possible export controls on other semiconductors which are also very important to them.\u201d US stocks inched higher midday Monday New York time, as some investors expressed optimism the talks signaled a cooling of trade brinkmanship. The first round of negotiations since the teams met a month ago is aimed at restoring confidence that both are living up to commitments made in Geneva. During those discussions, Washington and Beijing agreed to lower crippling tariffs for 90 days to allow time to hammer out ways to address a trade imbalance that the Trump administration blames on an unfair playing field. GLOBAL PREVIEW: London Calling - US, China Aim to Dodge Clash The confusion after the Geneva meeting about China\u2019s rare earth export-permitting process, combined with US limits on tech shipments and Washington\u2019s recent crackdown on Chinese student visas, underscore the complexity of deal-making between China and the US. \u201cThey left too many things open to interpretation,\u201d said Josh Lipsky, chair of international economics at the Atlantic Council. The US and China \u201cjust want to get back to where they were in Switzerland with a few more agreements down on paper to actually understand what is gonna be licensed, what gets permitted, what doesn\u2019t,\u201d he added. A phone call last week between President Donald Trump and his counterpart Xi Jinping appeared to give fresh momentum to reviving talks and reaching a deal. Delegates Arrive On Monday at London\u2019s Lancaster House \u2014 where former European Central Bank President Mario Draghi delivered his \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d speech in 2012 \u2014 US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will meet a Chinese delegation led by Vice Premier He Lifeng. The addition of Lutnick, who\u2019s in charge of curbs on the sale of advanced technology, signals Trump may be willing to consider reversing some of the restrictions that threaten to hobble China\u2019s long-term growth ambitions, ranging from tech supplies to jet engine parts. US-China trade tensions escalated this year as Trump hiked duties on Chinese goods, prompting retaliation from Beijing. That\u2019s led to pain in both economies, including distortions in data and uncertainties for businesses trying to navigate sudden changes in trade policy. Earlier on Monday, Chinese government figures showed exports rose less than expected last month as the worst drop in shipments to the US in more than five years counteracted strong demand from other markets. In the US, job growth moderated in May and the prior months were revised lower, indicating employers are cautious about growth prospects. Trump\u2019s tariffs are causing uncertainty and delays for US manufacturers, particularly in the Midwest, which is affecting their investment and production plans.

        "content": "The AI trade is back on after April'stariff rout, but retail investor purchases suggest it's taking a new shape. After a surge in dip buying following April's \"Liberation Day\" tariff announcement, \"there's been a clear shift away from Mag 7+ names\" into \"second-derivative AI laggards and other higher-risk opportunities,\" according to a recent analysis of retail investor flows by Marco Iachini and Lucas Mantle at Vanda Research. Nvidia (NVDA), a favorite among retail investors over the last few years, saw large outflows starting in mid-May aftershares jumpedon easing tensions between the U.S. and China. Purchases ofleveraged ETFs, which double or triple Nvidia's daily return, slumped to a 1-year low last month, \"though options activity shows no signs of bearish positioning,\" according to Vanda. \"We interpret this as classic profit-taking.\" Most of theMagnificent Sevenstocks are down since the start of the year, but nearly the entire group has sharply rebounded from early April's tariff panic. Retail investors who bought the dip are likely locking in profits from these \"core portfolio holdings.\" While investors are pivoting from the Magnificent Seven, they're not abandoning the AI trade. Rather, investors are piling into smaller data center stocks likeApplied Digital(APLD),Navitas Semiconductor(NVTS), andCoreWeave(CRWV), all of which are affiliated with Nvidia. Retail investor purchases of each increased by more than 150% over the past month. Mom-and-pop traders have also been big buyers of quantum computing stocks, a reflection of their substantial risk appetite. In the last week of May, retail investors bought more D-Wave Quantum (QBTS), with its $6 billion market cap, than they did UnitedHealth Group (UNH), a $275 billion company. In the time that investors bought a net $17 million of Meta (META) stock, they funneled $25 million into Rigetti Computing (RGTI). Iachini and Mantle note it's common for retail investors to venture into riskier corners of the market after a successful bout of dip-buying. But plenty of uncertainty about tariff policy and the economic outlook remain despite the market's recent rebound. Retail investors taking on more risk recently, \"while not unusual, suggests a level of complacency that may be mismatched with still-lingering macro risks and thus adds to our sense that we are living in the final innings of the current equity rally,\" they wrote. The market's risk appetite was on full display Monday, with the small-cap Russell 2000 and tech-heavy Nasdaqleading U.S. stock indexes higher.

Now, however, that volume of care has slowed, with Filton saying it has been \"slower to recover back to historical levels than than we might have imagined and expected.\" Revenue has stayed stable for UHS because they have raised prices to offset the lower volume of care people are seeking, but Filton said the company thinks the variables of price and procedural volume will get closer to historical averages over time.

GOOGL are among NVIDIA\u2019s well-known customers, and the company has plenty of room to run, banking on the boom in AI that many predict will soon become a trillion-dollar market. Similarly, quantum computing is an innovative field, but it still has room to grow. One of the major players in this area isIonQ, Inc.IONQ, whose shares have surged 374.7% over the past year. So, can it become the NVIDIA of quantum computing, and is it a promising investment? Let\u2019s explore \u2013 Image Source: Zacks Investment Research The quantum computing market is expected to exceed $1 trillion in value by 2035, according to McKinsey & Company. Quantum computing advancements benefit IONQ\u2019s system, aiding companies like Microsoft andAmazon.com, Inc.AMZN by providing AI researchers with quantum computing models. IONQ generates consistent revenues due to its unique linear ion chains in quantum computing, enabling it to surpass 100 qubits and minimize errors in comparison to other quantum computers. The company\u2019s CEO, Niccolo de Masi, is also optimistic about IONQ\u2019s future. He recently said, \u201cI believe IonQ will be the Nvidia player. There will be other people that copy us and follow us; they have always copied and followed us.\u201d Niccolo de Masi recently stated that a tech company might purchase IONQ for \u201chundreds of billions of dollars,\" which seems far-fetched given the company\u2019s current valuation of $9.668 billion. Nevertheless, his optimistic remarks led to significant gains in IONQ shares. However, these gains are driven more by hype than by fundamentals. When discussing fundamentals, IONQ\u2019s first-quarter revenues were unimpressive, and the company has yet to achieve profitability. The revenues of $7.6 million in the first quarter remained flat year over year, and although the non-GAAP loss of $0.14 per share narrowed from a loss of $0.19 per share in the same quarter last year, it is still a significant distance from profitability. NVIDIA, since its initial public offering (IPO) not only reported revenue growth but also improved profit margins. Before venturing into AI, NVIDIA was already a solid player in the video gaming market. And now, with demand increasing for its Blackwell chips and CUDA software, its share price is well-positioned to climb northward. However, real-world applications of quantum computing are still years away, lengthening IONQ\u2019s path to profitability and increasing risk. Therefore, it\u2019s premature to say that IONQ is the next NVIDIA (read more: Is NVIDIA's Rise in Value a Sign to Invest in NVDA Stock?). Despite profitability concerns and quantum computing being a speculative field, IONQ\u2019s revenues have witnessed a CAGR of 170% since 2021. Its revenues grew rapidly due to the ion trap architecture\u2019s scalability and competitive edge, attracting risk-tolerant investors to consider buying IONQ stock.

        "content": "Many investors still thinkpenny stocks are shares trading for less than a dollar, but that definition is decades out of date. In the past, penny stocks were considered any stocks that traded for less than $1 per share. However, rampant fraud in the 1980s compelled theU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission(SEC) to broaden its definition to include all shares trading below $5. The revision wasn't arbitrary: fraudsters had learned to price stocks just above $1 to escape regulatory scrutiny, and regulators recognized that a stock trading at $4.50 could pose greater risks than one at $0.50, especially when backed by companies with questionable fundamentals. The decision to set the threshold at $5 rather than $1 came after many fraud schemes in the 1980s, some of which included the mob.In the lead-up to passing thePenny Stock Reform Act of 1990, lawmakers discovered thatfraudulent schemesweren't limited to sub-dollar stocks\u2014they frequently involved securities trading between $1 and $5 a share. Two additional problems were linked to the rampant fraud: As of June 2025, Stock Analysis listed over 1,500 stocks trading under $5.00 per share on the major U.S. exchanges.Accounting for companies with multiple listed shares, this means that more than a third of the companies whose stock trades on theNew York Stock Exchange or Nasdaqhave a share price under $5.00. The 1980s penny stock market resembled a financial Wild West, dominated bynotorious boiler room operationswith names like Blinder Robinson\u2014nicknamed \"Blind'em and Rob'em\" by industry insiders.Other major penny stock brokerages included First Jersey Securities, Rooney Pace, and Stuart-James. Major penny stock brokerages operating in the 1990s included Stratton Oakmont, Sterling Foster, A.S. Goldmen, and Hanover Sterling. These firms employed armies of high-pressure salespeople working from cramped offices, cold-calling unsuspecting investors with promises of overnight riches. The era's rampant securities-related crimes inspired the 2013 filmThe Wolf of Wall Street, which dramatized thepump-and-dump schemesthat made Stratton Oakmont. Pump-and-dumps rely on artificially inflating a stock's price, with insiders then selling their shares at the peak for massive profits, leaving others with worthless holdings. These schemes typically target penny stocks because they're easier to manipulate due to thin trading and limited public information. These frauds haven't gone away. The boiler rooms of the 1980s have largely been replaced by sophisticated social media campaigns, encrypted messages, and email blasts, but the structure remains the same. For example, in 2022, the SEC uncovered amassive pump-and-dump schemeinvolving 16 defendants across three continents who generated more than $194 million in illicit proceeds. Most penny stocks don't trade on major exchanges. However, shares of some companies with large market capitalizations trade below $5 each on the Nasdaq or New York Stock Exchange. Totrade on major stock exchangespenny stocks must meetspecific listing requirements. For example, the Nasdaq requires a share price of at least $4.00. However, a company can remain on the exchange with a lower price if it meets other requirements. Stocks must also have a minimum of 1 million publicly traded\u00a0shares outstanding (excluding those held by insiders who own more than 10% of the company). The $5 penny stock threshold reflectsregulatory evolution aimed at protecting investors. While the term \"penny stock\" suggests extremely low prices, the SEC's latest definition captures a broader range of highly speculative, low-priced securities.",

Under the previous administration, NVIDIA was allowed to sell China high-quality chips, but not their best stuff, which were reserved for America and a bizarre list of 18 friendly countries. Now, the Trump administration won\u2019t even let NVIDIA sell their second or third best stuff. As CEO Jensen Huang said on our show, it\u2019s logical to presume that China won\u2019t use these chips for the military precisely because they\u2019re American chips\u2026 A close-up of a colorful high-end graphics card being plugged in to a gaming computer.

        "content": "Apple (AAPL) on Monday announced a number of AI-related improvements with its iOS 26. However, those looking for some of Apple's highly anticipated updates, including AI-enhanced Siri features, are going to have to wait. Apple Senior Vice President of Software Engineering Craig Federighi said during the tech giant's Worldwide Developers Conference Monday that the Siri features \u201cneed more time to reach our high quality bar\u201d and that more information will be released \u201cin the coming year.\u201dApple has previously suggested the release of its more personalized Siri, potentially capable of performing tasks within other apps, may not come until at least 2026, which Morgan Stanley warned couldhurt iPhone sales. For now, Apple unveiled a software development kit called Foundation Models Framework that will allow developers to build apps using the AI large language models within Apple Intelligence. \u201cWe think this will ignite a whole new wave of intelligent experiences in the apps you use every day,\u201d Federighi said. The company also showcased its iOS 26, the latest software update for iPhones, Macs, and other devices coming this fall (and a naming shift away from what would have been iOS 19). It includes AI-powered live translation features with an expanded slate of languages, new Genmoji capabilities including integration with ChatGPT, and Apple's first major aesthetic redesign in years, referred to as \u201cliquid glass.\u201d Other announcements included a new Games app, a revamped CarPlay interface, and a streamlined Photos app that brings back separate tabs for users' camera roll and albums. The company touted its Apple TV+ lineup as well, including new seasons of \"The Morning Show,\" \"Slow Horses,\" \"Loot,\" and a new series called \"Chief of War,\" among others. Still, the lack of new AI Siri features is glaring as Apple faces growing pressure to prove it can compete with other tech leaders with artificial intelligence. Last month, ChatGPT maker OpenAI took what could be seen as a step toward competing with Apple in offering AI devices with plans toacquire io, an AI startup launched by former Apple design head Jony Ive.

        "header": "Democrats Urge Trump Administration to Pump Brakes on Freddie, Fannie Move",
        "content": "Some leading congressional Democrats are pushing back on a big housing idea that President Donald Trump recently floated. Led by Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, more than a dozen Senate Democrats sent a letter to the Trump administration arguing it should pause any efforts to release mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac from government control. They said the Trump administration needs to better explain its plans before moving forward. \u201cHasty and poorly planned changes to [Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac] could dramatically increase costs for families seeking to purchase a home, rewarding President Trump\u2019s billionaire campaign contributors while making the housing crisis even worse,\u201d said the June 5 letter addressed to the Federal Housing Financing Administration, which oversees Fannie and Freddie. Fannie Mae and Freddie Machelp the housing market by buying mortgages from banks and packaging them together as a special investment similar to a bond. They are private companies with government backing that would cover their potential losses. During the2008 financial crisis, the federal government took control of these companies through a process called \u201cconservatorship.\u201d While private investors can buy shares of Fannie and Freddie on the over-the-counter market, they are no longer listed on the New York Stock Exchange.Trump\u2019s proposalwould have the government relinquish its control of the companies, even as it maintains a limited guarantee. He would have the companies relisted on a major stock exchange, making their stock easier for retail investors to buy, according to a post on Truth Social. The proposal is controversial, especially since releasing the pair from government control could increase risks for its investment products, potentially leading to higher mortgage rates. Releasing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac from conservatorship could also benefit shareholders like Pershing Square CEO Bill Ackman, who endorsed Trump in 2024, if they are relisted on a stock exchange. The Democrats raised these concerns in their letter. The letter comes as some analysts assess the impact of releasing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac from government control and relisting the stock. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, laid out how he thinks the move could impact mortgage rates in a series of social media posts last week. He said much of the outcome would depend on what kind of guarantee the government would provide to Fannie and Freddie once it relinquishes control of the companies. By strengthening the government's guarantee of Fannie and Freddie, mortgage rates could be lower by as much as a quarter of a percentage point, Zandi argued. However, if the government were to withdraw its guarantee of Fannie and Freddie, mortgage rates could be higher by as much as 0.6 to 0.9 percentage points. However, while Trump is proposing a change, Zandi said that there are 50% odds that the current system for Fannie and Freddie will remain unchanged. \u201cMortgage rates won\u2019t change. The system works well as-is, with risks already shifted to private investors via credit risk transfers. No legislation is needed, and there\u2019s little incentive to disrupt what\u2019s already functioning smoothly,\u201d Zandi wrote. Cato Institute economist Norbert Michel agreed that the way the government guarantees Fannie and Freddie can have an impact on mortgage rates, but he said the impacts would be minimal, arguing that eliminating the guarantee would equal about a quarter of a percentage point rise in mortgage rates. \u201cIt's not so clear that it's an enormous cost difference and we haven't even addressed whether that's worth it and whether the benefit is outweighing the cost,\u201d said Michel, director of Cato\u2019s Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives. Michel argued that the government should get out of the business of backing the mortgage giants and let other private-sector financial institutions fill the role that Fannie and Freddie now serve \u201cPrivate profits should not be paired with the socialization of losses. Anything short of eliminating government sponsorship for these firms would leave in place the same system that led to the 2008 financial crisis,\u201d Michel said.",

        "header": "Amazon wants to become a global marketplace for AI",
        "content": "Amazon Web Services isn't betting on one large language model (LLM) winning the artificial intelligence race. Instead, it's offering customers a buffet of models to choose from. AWS, the cloud computing arm of Amazon (AMZN), aims to become the go-to infrastructure layer for the AI economy, regardless of which model wins out. By making customer choice a defining principle, AWS hopes to win out against rivals that have aligned closely with specific LLM providers \u2014 notably Microsoft (MSFT), which partnered with ChatGPT creator OpenAI (OPAI.PVT). \u201cWe don't think that there's going to be one model to rule them all,\u201d Dave Brown, vice president of compute and networking at AWS, told Yahoo Finance. The model-neutral approach is embedded into Amazon Bedrock, a service that allows AWS customers to build their own applications using a wide range of models, with more than 100 to choose from. Brown added that after Chinese startup DeepSeek surprised the world, AWS had a fully managed version of the disruptive model available on Bedrock within a week. Two years after its launch, Bedrock is now the fastest-growing service offered by AWS, which accounted for over 18% of Amazon\u2019s total revenue in the first quarter. It's why Amazon CEO Andy Jassy sees Bedrock as a core part of the company\u2019s AI growth strategy. But to understand the competitive advantage AWS hopes to offer with Bedrock, you have to go back to its origin story. Bedrock dates back to a six-page internal memo that Atul Deo, AWS\u2019s director of product management, wrote in 2020. Before OpenAI's ChatGPT launched in 2022 and made \u201cgenerative AI\u201d a household term, Deo pitched a service that could generate code from plain English prompts using large language models. But Jassy, the head of AWS at the time, didn\u2019t buy it. \u201cHis initial reaction was, 'This seems almost like a pipe dream,'\u201d Deo said. He added that while a tool that makes coding easy sounds obvious now, the technology was \u201cstill not quite there.\u201d When that project, initially known as Code Whisperer, launched in 2023, the team realized they could offer the service for a broader set of use cases, giving customers a choice of different models with \u201cgeneric capabilities\u201d that \u201ccould be used as a foundation to build a lot of interesting applications,\u201d according to Deo. Deo noted that the team steered away from doubling down on its own model after it recognized a pattern of customers wanting choice in other AWS services. This led to AWS becoming the first provider to offer a range of different models to customers. With this foundational approach in mind, Amazon renamed the project Bedrock. To be sure, the model-agnostic approach has risks, and many analysts don't consider Amazon to be leading the AI race, even though it has ramped up its AI spending. If there is ultimately one model to rule them all, similar to how Google came to dominate search, Amazon could risk further falling behind. At the beginning of the year, Amazon and its peers Meta (META), Microsoft, and Google parent Alphabet (GOOG) expected tospend $325 billion combined, mostly on AI infrastructure. To keep pace, Amazon has hedged its bets with its own technology and one LLM provider in particular: Anthropic. In November 2024, AWS doubled its investment in Anthropic to $8 billion in a deal that requires Anthropic to train its large language model, Claude, using only AWS\u2019s chips. (For comparison, Microsoft has invested over $13billioninto OpenAI.) The $8 billion deal allows Amazon to prove out its AI training infrastructure and deepen ties with one LLM provider while continuing to offer customers a wide selection of models on Bedrock. \u201cI mean, this is cloud selling 101, right?\u201d said Dan Rosenthal, head of go-to-market partnerships at Anthropic. \u201cThere are some cases where it's been very clear that a customer wants to use a different model on Bedrock for something that we just frankly don't focus on, and that's great. We want to win where we have a right to win.\u201d Amazon also launched its own family of foundational models, called Nova, at the end of 2024, two years after the launch of ChatGPT. But competition and expectations remain high: Revenue at AWS increased 16.9% to $29.27 billion in Q1, marking the third time in a row it missed analyst estimates despite double-digit growth. The Anthropic partnership also underscores a bigger competition AWS may be fighting with chipmakers, including Nvidia (NVDA), which recently staged a$1 trillion rallyin just two months after anearnings printthat eased investor concerns about chip export controls. While Amazon is an Nvidia customer, it also produces highly effective and more affordable AI chips based on power consumed (known as \u201cprice performance\u201d). On Bedrock, AWS lets clients choose whether to use its own CPUs and GPUs or chips from competitors like Intel (INTC), AMD (AMD), and Nvidia. \u201cWe're able to work with the model providers to really optimize the model for the hardware that it runs,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThere\u2019s no change the customer has to make.\u201d Customers not only have a choice of model but also a choice of which infrastructure the model should run and train on. This helps AWS compete on price \u2014 a key battleground with Nvidia, which offers the most expensive chips on the market. This \u201ccoopetition\u201d dynamic could position Amazon to take market share from Nvidia if it can prove its own chips can do the job for a lower sticker price. It\u2019s a bet that Amazon is willing to spend on, with capital expenditures expected to hit $100 billion in 2025, up from $83 billion last year. While AWS doesn\u2019t break out its costs for AI, CEO Andy Jassy said on an earnings call in February that the \u201cvast majority of that capex spend is on AI for AWS.\u201d In an April letter to shareholders, Jassy noted that \u201cAI revenue is growing at triple-digit YoY percentages and represents a multibillion-dollar annual revenue run rate.\u201d Click here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

        "content": "Oracle (ORCL) is scheduled to report fiscal fourth-quarter results after the closing bell Wednesday, with analysts watching for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure growth fueled by demand for AI. Jefferies analysts, who hold a \"buy\" rating for the stock, said in a note to clients over the weekend that they expect \"an inflection in both OCI and backlog over the next few quarters\" as capacity constraints ease, and raised their price target to $200 from $190. Citi analysts, who have a \"neutral\" rating and $185 price target, said checks from a recent event suggested \"greater enterprise customer interest in OCI database modernization,\" though they'll be watching for \"greater conviction around the pace of profitability improvement in OCI.\" OCI revenue is expected to surge 54% year-over-year to $3.11 billion, with total revenue rising 9% to $15.57 billion, according to analysts' estimates compiled Visible Alpha. Adjusted net income is projected to rise to $4.75 billion, or $1.64 per share, up from $4.61 billion, or $1.63 per share, a year earlier. Of the 13 analysts tracked by Visible Alpha, six have a \u201cbuy\u201d rating for Oracle stock, alongside seven \u201chold\" ratings. Their consensus price target of about $174 is slightly below Monday's closing price just above $177. The stock has been on a tear in recent weeks, adding about 7% in June so far, and roughly one-quarter of their value since the end of April.",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Supply Lines is a daily newsletter that tracks global trade. Sign up here. Most Read from Bloomberg Next Stop: Rancho Cucamonga! Where Public Transit Systems Are Bouncing Back Around the World Trump Said He Fired the National Portrait Gallery Director. She\u2019s Still There. NYC Mayoral Candidates All Agree on Building More Housing. But Where? US Housing Agency Vulnerable to Fraud After DOGE Cuts, Documents Warn Trade talks between the US and China will continue into a second day, according to a US official, as the two sides look to ease tensions over shipments of technology and rare earth elements. Representatives for both nations ended their first day of negotiations in London after more than six hours at Lancaster House, a 19th century mansion near Buckingham Palace. The talks concluded around 8 p.m. London time. The advisers will meet again Tuesday at 10 a.m. in the British capital, the official said. \u201cWe are doing well with China. China\u2019s not easy,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House on Monday. \u201cI\u2019m only getting good reports.\u201d The US delegation was led by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer. The presence of Lutnick, the former Cantor Fitzgerald CEO, underscored the importance that export controls are playing in these discussions. Bessent told reporters in London they had a \u201cgood meeting\u201d and Lutnick called the discussions \u201cfruitful.\u201d The Chinese delegation was led by Vice Premier He Lifeng, who left without commenting to the media. With him was Commerce Minister Wang Wentao and his deputy Li Chenggang, the country\u2019s trade representative. Wang has become a fixture in the entourage of President Xi Jinping on overseas trips since he was appointed in 2020, while Li is a veteran trade bureaucrat and was previously ambassador to the World Trade Organization. The Ministry of Commerce can be seen as the counterpart to both the US Department of Commerce and the Office of the Trade Representative. The US signaled a willingness to remove restrictions on some tech exports in exchange for assurances that China is easing limits on rare earth shipments, which are critical to a wide array of energy, defense and technology products, including smartphones, fighter jets and nuclear reactor rods. China accounts for almost 70% of the world\u2019s production of rare earths. Specifically, the Trump administration is prepared to remove a recent spate of measures targeting chip design software, jet engine parts, chemicals and nuclear materials, people familiar with the matter said. Many of those actions were taken in the past few weeks as tensions flared between the US and China. Trump was noncommittal about lifting export curbs, telling reporters \u201cwe\u2019ll see\u201d when asked about the possibility of such a move. \u201cChina has been ripping off the United States for many years,\u201d the US president said, while adding that \u201cwe want to open up China.\u201d The Trump administration expects that \u201cafter the handshake\u201d in London, \u201cany export controls from the US will be eased and the rare earths will be released in volume\u201d by China, Kevin Hassett, head of the White House\u2019s National Economic Council, told CNBC earlier in the day Monday. Hassett\u2019s comments from Washington were the clearest signal yet that the US is willing to offer such a concession, though he added that the US would stop short of including the most sophisticated chips made by Nvidia Corp. used to power artificial intelligence. \u201cThe very, very high-end Nvidia stuff is not what I\u2019m talking about,\u201d Hassett said, adding that restrictions would not be lifted on the Nvidia H2O chips that are used to train AI services. \u201cI\u2019m talking about possible export controls on other semiconductors which are also very important to them.\u201d Chinese shares trading in Hong Kong entered a bull market, as some investors expressed hope the talks signaled a cooling of trade tensions. In the US, traders drove stocks higher, with the S&P 500 within 2% of its February peak. The first round of negotiations since delegations from the countries met a month ago is aimed at restoring confidence that both sides are living up to commitments made in Geneva. During those discussions, Washington and Beijing agreed to lower crippling tariffs for 90 days to allow time to address a trade imbalance that the Trump administration blames on an unfair playing field. Despite that truce, trade didn\u2019t recover in May, with Chinese exports to the US dropping by the most since the start of the pandemic and imports from the US down by almost 20% in May. A phone call last week between President Donald Trump and Xi appeared to give fresh momentum to reaching a deal. US-China trade tensions escalated this year as Trump hiked duties on Chinese goods, prompting retaliation from Beijing. That\u2019s led to pain in both economies, including uncertainties for businesses trying to navigate sudden changes in trade policy. --With assistance from Meghashyam Mali, Mackenzie Hawkins, Jennifer A.
