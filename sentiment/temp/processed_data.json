The EV maker\u2019s stock gained 10% last week, closing Friday at around $325, not far from the level it traded at beforeMusk and Trump engaged in a testy back-and-forththe week before last, sending shares sharply lower. Tensions cooled after the Tesla chief admittedhe regreted some of his posts, while Trump told theNew York Postlast week that he hasn\u2019t ruled out reconciling with Musk. Tesla shares have risen more than 50% from their early-April low as Musk hasstepped back from his role with the federal government.

        "header": "Nvidia's pitch for sovereign AI resonates with EU leaders",
        "content": "By Supantha Mukherjee PARIS (Reuters) -Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang has been pitching the idea of \"sovereign AI\" since 2023. Europe is now starting to listen and act. The concept is based on the idea that the language, knowledge, history and culture of each region are different, and every nation needs to develop and own its AI. Last week, the CEO of the artificial-intelligence chipmaker toured Europe's major capitals - London, Paris and Berlin - announcing a slew of projects and partnerships, while highlighting the lack of AI infrastructure in the region. In a place where leaders are increasingly wary of the continent's dependency on a handful of U.S. tech companies and after drawing ire from the U.S. President Donald Trump, his vision has started to gain traction. \"We are going to invest billions in here ... but Europe needs to move into AI quickly,\" Huang said on Wednesday in Paris. On Monday of last week, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced 1 billion pounds ($1.35 billion) in funding to scale up computing power in a global race \"to be an AI maker and not an AI taker.\" French President Emmanuel Macron called building AI infrastructure \"our fight for sovereignty\" at VivaTech, one of the largest global tech conferences. After Nvidia laid out plans to build an AI cloud platform in Germany with Deutsche Telekom, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz called it an \"important step\" for the digital sovereignty and economic future of Europe's top economy. Europe lags behind both the U.S. and China as its cloud infrastructure is mostly run by Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet's Google, and it has only a few smaller AI companies such as Mistral to rival the U.S. ones. \"There's no reason why Europe shouldn't have tech champions,\" said 31-year-old Mistral CEO Arthur Mensch, sitting beside Huang, who has led Nvidia for more than three decades, at a panel at VivaTech. \"This is a gigantic dream.\" GIGAFACTORY PLANS UNLEASHED In France, Mistral has partnered with Nvidia to build a data centre to power the AI needs of European companies with a homegrown alternative. It will use 18,000 of the latest Nvidia AI chips in the first phase, with plans to expand across multiple sites in 2026. In February, the European Union announced plans to build four \"AI gigafactories\" at a cost of $20 billion to lower dependence on U.S. firms. The European Commission has been in touch with Huang and he had told the EU executive that he was going to allocate some chip production to Europe for these factories, an EU official told Reuters. Nvidia's chips known as Graphics Processing Units or GPUs are crucial for building AI data centres from the U.S. to Japan and India to the Middle East. In Europe, a push for sovereign AI could reshape the tech landscape with domestic cloud providers, AI startups, and chipmakers standing to gain from new government funding and a shift toward in-region data infrastructure. Nvidia also wants to cement demand for its AI chips, ensuring that even as countries seek independence, they still rely on its technology to get there. POWER COSTS The push is not without challenges. High electricity costs and rising demand could strain sourcing of electricity for data centres. Data centres account for 3% of EU electricity demand, but their consumption is expected to increase rapidly this decade due to AI. Mistral, which has raised just over $1 billion, is trying to become a European homegrown champion with a fraction of the money U.S. hyperscalers or large data-centre operators spend in a month. \"Hyperscalers are spending $10 billion to $15 billion per quarter in their infrastructure. Who in Europe can afford that exactly?\" said Pascal Brier, chief innovation officer at Capgemini, a partner of both Nvidia and Mistral. \"It doesn't mean we shouldn't do anything, but we have to be cognizant about the fact that there will always be a gap.\" Mistral has launched several AI models which are used by businesses but companies tend to mix them with models from other companies such as OpenAI, Anthropic and Meta Platforms. \"Most of the time it's not Mistral or the rest, it's Mistral and the rest,\" Brier said.

        "header": "My Top 5 AI Stocks to Buy Before the Second Half",
        "content": "The first half of the year was a turbulent one for stocks in general amid concern President Trump's planned import tariffs would hurt the economy. And this problem weighed most heavily on stocks that depend on growth and investment -- such as those in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). These particular players led indexes higher over the past two years on optimism about spending and the technology's potential, but they lost momentum in March and April. Since, though, the U.S. has made progress on trade talks, and this has lifted market sentiment. Meanwhile, tech companies' earnings reports showno signs of a slowdownin AI spending. This has spurred new gains in AI stocks, and if the U.S. trade situation resolves without excessively high tariffs, these players could continue to advance. With this in mind, here are my top five AI stocks to buy before the second half. Image source: Getty Images. Nvidia(NVDA1.00%)soared more than 800% over the past two years as investors piled into this stock drivingthe AI revolution. The company dominates the AI chip market, and these chips are used for the most essential AI tasks. Nvidia hasn't had to wait to benefit from the AI market. The company already has delivered double- or triple-digit growth, with revenue attaining record levels. This momentum is likely to continue as Nvidia is well positioned to power AI across every stage of development, from training through the creation of humanoid robots. I'm confident about this thanks to Nvidia's commitment to innovation -- it's already set out a calendar of chip updates through 2028. This makes it very difficult for rivals to upset its position. Now is a great time to get in on this high-potential player as it's on sale, trading for 33 timesforward earnings estimates-- down from more than 50 earlier in the year. Amazon(AMZN0.20%), which sells some imported goods on its e-commerce site and also works with sellers that import goods, may benefit as trade tensions ease. The company also is winning from AI in two ways: Amazon uses AI tools to streamline operations, resulting in lower costs and greater efficiency. And Amazon, through its cloud unit Amazon Web Services (AWS), sells AI services to customers. AI services already have helped AWS reach a $117 billion annual revenuerun rate. All of this could make Amazon a winner in the second half of this year and beyond. On top of this, the company already has demonstrated its earnings strength, growing revenue and profit over time. And its overhaul of its cost structure in recent years should drive even more gains moving forward. Amazon's valuation has fallen from more than 40 times forward earnings estimates earlier this year to 34 times expected earnings, offering investors a bargain entry point right now. Image source: Getty Images. SoundHound AI(SOUN1.65%)shares have dropped more than 50% this year -- not as a result of any negative news, but primarily as investors rotated out of younger growth stocks, seen as risky. This company isn't yet profitable, which is standard at this stage of development, but revenue is soaring -- advancing more than 150% in the latest quarter. This is as customers rush to get in on SoundHound's voice AI technology. The company specializes in this area and has quickly progressed from serving mainly the automobile market to now working with a wide variety of industries, from healthcare to restaurants and financial services. To further emphasize the diversification of its customer base, SoundHound says each single customer represents 10% or less of its revenue. Now is a fantastic time to get in on SoundHound because it's trading for a lower price than earlier this year, and this company still is in the early days of its growth story -- the total addressable market for voice AI is more than $140 billion -- suggesting there's plenty of room for revenue expansion over time. Palantir Technologies(PLTR1.72%)has soared over the past year even as valuation has reached mind-boggling levels. The stock trades for more than 200 times forward earnings estimates. But aggressive investors with a long-term view shouldn't necessarily stay away from this high-flyer. Palantir's earnings also have soared, and the ongoing strong demand even prompted the company to lift its revenue, adjusted income from operations, and adjusted free cash flow guidance for the year. What makes this company stand out? Through its software platforms, Palantir helps customers easily harness the power of AI and their own data to streamline their operations, make better and faster decisions, and much more. The company has relied on government customers for years, but in recent times, as the AI boom strengthened and Palantir launched an AI platform, commercial customers knocked on the door. Today, commercial growth is soaring -- and this could be the motor to drive earnings and the stock higher in the quarters to come. This makes Palantir a great growth stock to buy now and hold -- in spite of its lofty valuation. Apple(AAPL-1.62%)produces most of its iPhones in China and also manufactures products in India and Vietnam -- and that's why investors have worried about an eventual tax on imports. Even the company's plan to move much of its production of iPhones for the U.S. out of China -- the country most affected by tariffs -- to India won't totally insulate Apple from these extra costs. And Trump recently threatened Apple with a specific tariff of 25% on its imported iPhones. Considering this, why should you buy this tech giant now? The U.S. currently is involved in trade negotiations and potentially even considering the situation of technology players -- it's unlikely the Trump administration will make a decision that would sink Apple or any other U.S. tech giant, so once these times of uncertainty are over, I'm optimistic Apple stock will rebound. Apple has a solidbrand moat, or competitive advantage, and that's helped the company steadily grow earnings over time. Today, services offer this powerhouse a new revenue driver that could boost growth for many years down the road considering Apple's base of 2.2 billion active devices -- and this top tech company is in the early stages of AI innovation across its devices. That's why, trading at 27 times forward earnings estimates, Apple is a top stock to buy before the second half.",

        "content": "The U.S. economy produced the world's most valuable companies for more than a century: Eight other American companies have joined Apple in the trillion-dollar club since then:Nvidia,Microsoft,Amazon,Alphabet,Meta Platforms,Tesla,Broadcom, andBerkshire Hathaway. I predict another company is likely to join them within the next few years.Oracle(ORCL-1.28%)operates some of the most powerful and most cost-efficient data center infrastructure in the world for artificial intelligence (AI) workloads. Demand is significantly exceeding available supply, as some of the industry's top developers are lining up around the block to use it. Oracle had a market capitalization of $600 billion, so investors who buy its stock today could earn a whopping 65% return if it climbs into the $1 trillion club. Here's why I think it will. Image source: Getty Images. Every new generation ofAImodel requires more computing capacity than the last. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says some of the latest \"reasoning\" models -- which spend more time before rendering a response to produce more accurate information -- use up to1,000 times more computing powerthan traditionallarge language models(LLMs), which specialize in crafting one-shot responses. That computing capacity is delivered by enormous data centers that are filled with graphics processing units (GPUs) from top chip suppliers like Nvidia andAdvanced Micro Devices. Most businesses don't have the financial resources to build this infrastructure themselves, so they rent it from companies like Oracle that operate centralized data centers situated all over the world. Oracle's Gen2Clouddata centers allow developers to scale up to 131,072 of Nvidia's industry-leading Blackwell GB200 GPUs, paving the way for the most powerful AI models to date. Plus, Oracle's infrastructure uses a proprietary random direct memory access (RDMA) networking technology, which moves data from one point to another faster than traditional Ethernet networks. Developers typically pay for computing capacity by the minute, so speedy processing can translate into substantial cost savings. Gen2's scalability and cost efficiency are the reasons top AI developers likeOpenAI, Meta Platforms, andElon Musk'sxAI are lining up to use it. However, Oracle simply doesn't have enough capacity to meet demand right now, so it's planning to spend over $25 billion to build new data centers during its fiscal year 2026 (which began June 1). Chairman Larry Ellison says that Oracle will eventually operate more data centers than every other player in the industry combined. He thinks the company can scale up to between 1,000 and 2,000 locations over the long term, which would be more than 10 times its current footprint. Oracle generated $15.9 billion in totalrevenueduring its fiscal 2025 fourth quarter (ended May 31). It was an 11% increase from the year-ago period, which represented an acceleration from the 6% growth the company delivered in the third quarter three months earlier. But the real growth story lies beneath the surface of the headline number. The Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) segment -- which is where the company accounts for its AI data center revenue -- soared by 52% year over year to $3 billion. And it gets better, because Oracle CEO Safra Katz predicts that OCI's revenue growth will accelerate to 70% throughout fiscal 2026. I mentioned earlier that demand for Oracle's data center capacity is far exceeding supply. That showed up in the company'sremaining performance obligations(RPOs) in Q4, which surged by 41% to a record $138 billion. RPOs are like an order backlog that Oracle expects will convert into revenue over time, so they give investors an indication of how much future demand is currently in the pipeline. Oracle generated $4.34 inearnings per share(EPS) during fiscal 2025, which places its stock at aprice-to-earnings (P/E) ratioof 49.6. That isn't necessarily cheap, since theNasdaq-100technology index -- which hosts all of Oracle's big-tech peers \u2013 trades at a P/E ratio of 30.6. However, Oracle's premium valuation might be justified for now considering its accelerating growth and its substantial RPOs, which will give investors confidence that the company can sustain its momentum. Wall Street's consensus estimate (provided by Yahoo! Finance) suggests that Oracle's EPS could soar to $6.75 in fiscal 2026, and then to $8.17 in fiscal 2027. Based on those forecasts, Oracle stock trades atforward P/E ratiosof 31.9 and 26.3, respectively. That means that Oracle stock would have to soar by 88% over the next two years just to maintain its current P/E ratio of 47.2, which would catapult the company's valuation to over $1 trillion. To be clear, it won't be easy for Oracle to maintain its premium P/E ratio unless it can convince investors that OCI growth will continue to accelerate. This isn't out of the question, since the company plans to expand its data center footprint by more than tenfold in the coming years. Oracle might still have a pathway to the $1 trillion club even if its P/E ratio shrinks, except it could take four or five years instead of two. In any case, the stock could be a great buy for investors right now.",

        "content": "Nvidia(NVDA1.00%)is ideally positioned to be a major player in the market for physical artificial intelligence (AI), a technology that lets autonomous machines such as cars and robots understand, navigate, and interact with the real world. Nevertheless, certain hedge fund billionaires sold shares in the first quarter: Meanwhile, those same hedge fund managers, and others, boughtUber Technologies(UBER-2.10%), a company well positioned to benefit from robotaxis and whose stock has soared 300% in the past three years. More broadly, recently filedForms 13Fshow that the number of large institutional investors (i.e., those with at least $100 million in securities) holding Nvidia declined 2% sequentially in the first quarter. Meanwhile, the number of large asset managers holding Uber increased 8%. Read on to learn more about these stocks. Nvidia is the market leader in data centergraphics processing units(GPUs), chips that are the industry standard in accelerating complex workloads such as trainingmachine learningmodels and runningartificial intelligence(AI) applications. Importantly, Nvidia holds more than 90% of the market in data center GPUs, and the market is forecast to grow at 28% annually through 2030. Nvidia has also developed a robust software platform called CUDA. It comprises developer tools such as code libraries, frameworks, and pretrained models that streamline the building of AI applications across multiple disciplines. For instance, Nvidia Drive is a platform forautonomous vehicles, and Nvidia Isaac supportsautonomous robots. In short, Nvidia brings together the data center systems, software development tools, and embedded systems (i.e., onboard computers that power autonomous cars and robots). Thatvertical integrationis an advantage, because it lets Nvidia design systems with the lowest total cost of ownership, and developers need not waste time integrating products from multiple vendors. Looking ahead, Wall Street estimates Nvidia's earnings will increase at 28% annually over the next three years. That consensus makes the current valuation of 46 times earnings look fair. So why did certain hedge funds sell the stock in the first quarter? Profit-taking probably contributed, but I suspect they were also worried about exports controls andDeepSeek. However, while the Trump administration has restricted the export of H20 GPUs to China, it also revoked the Biden-eraAI Diffusion Rulethat would have limited sales to dozens of countries. And while the cost efficiencies DeepSeek achieved could hurt demand for Nvidia GPUs, many experts expect the opposite. Lower costs will make AI accessible to more companies, which should more than offset any decrease in demand. Image source: Waymo. Uber leads the U.S. ride-sharing market with a 76% share, according to Bloomberg. It also ranks second in the restaurant food delivery market, with a 24% share. The company is also the market leader in ride-sharing services in nine other countries, and the market leader in food-delivery services in eight  countries. Here's the two-part investment thesis for Uber: First, the company should be able to grow its market share in ride-sharing and food-delivery services as consumers lean into new product categories such as grocery and retail, and the Uber One membership program. In addition, advertising revenue should keep growing steadily as Uber collects more consumer data. Second, Uber is ideally positioned to serve as a demand aggregator for autonomous ride-sharing companies. The company values the U.S. market alone at $1 trillion, and CEO Dana Khosrowshahi recently told analysts, \"Uber can deliver the lowest operational costs for our [autonomous vehicle] partners because we are leaps and bounds ahead on every aspect of the go-to-market capabilities.\" Importantly, Uber is already involved with several autonomous ride-sharing companies, includingAlphabet's Waymo in Phoenix; Austin, Texas; and, soon, Atlanta. Uber also works withWeRidein Abu Dhabi and, soon, Dubai, and it plans to add 15 more cities in the next five years. Similarly, May Mobility plans to deploy thousands of robotaxis on Uber in the next few years, with an initial launch in Arlington, Texas, slated for late 2025. Uber stock currently trades at 15 times earnings, a discount to the one-year average of 40 times earnings. The present valuation looks quite reasonable for a company whose earnings are forecast to grow at 25% annually over the next three years. Patient investors should feel comfortable buying a small position today.",

        "content": "Warren Buffett has earned a reputation as one of Wall Street's greatest investors. The many acquisitions and stock purchases he has engineered since assuming control ofBerkshire Hathawayin 1965 have created immense wealth for shareholders. Berkshire stock has returned 20% annually over the last six decades, while theS&P 500(^GSPC-1.13%)has gained 10.4% annually. Nevertheless, I suspect many investors ignore one of his more prudent recommendations. Buffett has often advised investors to periodically buy and patiently hold an S&P 500 index fund. \"I recommend the S&P 500 index fund, and have for a long, long time, to people,\" he said in 2021. Here's how that advice could turn a $400 monthly investment into $851,800 over 30 years. Image source: Getty Images. TheS&P 500measures the performance of 500 large and profitable U.S. companies that cover about 80% of domestic equities and 50% of global equities by market value. TheVanguard S&P 500 ETF(VOO-1.22%)tracks the S&P 500, allowing investors to spread capital across many of the most influential businesses in the world. The 10 largest positions in the Vanguard ETF are listed by weight below: Warren Buffett, in his 1993 letter to shareholders, wrote, \"By periodically investing in an index fund, for example, the know-nothing investor can actually outperform most investment professionals.\" Indeed, only 15% of large-cap funds outperformed the S&P 500 over the last three years, meaning most professional money managers struggle to consistently beat the index. Buffett added context in his 2016 shareholder letter. \"American business -- and consequently a basket of stocks -- is virtually certain to be worth far more in the years ahead.\" An S&P 500 index fund satisfies that criterion. It is a readymade portfolio comprising hundreds of companies that form the foundation of the United States economy, which itself is the world's most prosperous and innovative large economy, according toJPMorgan ChaseCEO Jamie Dimon. Importantly, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF has anexpense ratioof 0.03%, meaning shareholders will pay $0.30 annually for every $1,000 invested in the fund. Comparatively, the average U.S. exchange-traded fund and mutual fund charged 0.34% last year, according toMorningstar. The S&P 500 returned 1,860% in the last 30 years, equivalent to 10.4% annually. That period covers a broad range of market and economic environments, including more than a dozencorrectionsand three recessions, so investors can reasonably assume similar returns in the next 30 years. With that in mind, assuming invested dollars compound at 10.4% annually, $400 contributed monthly to the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF would be worth $77,900 in one decade, $287,700 in two decades, and $851,800 in three decades. Readers may wonder how to contribute $400 per month to the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF when the current share price is $549. There are two options. First, most brokerages support the purchase of fractional shares, meaning you could buy less than one share monthly. Second, for anyone who prefers to buy whole shares, you can simply add $400 to your account each month and make purchases as you accumulate sufficient cash. Here's the bottom line:S&P 500 index funds(such as the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF) are a cheap and easy way for investors to gain exposure to hundreds of influential stocks, includingApple,Nvidia, andTesla. Such investment products have created substantial wealth for patient shareholders in the past, and investors have every reason to believe the results will be similar in the future.",

        "content": "Investing.com -- The 2025 BofA Global Tech conference offered a cautiously optimistic view of the technology sector, with AI again at the center of attention. Demand trends appeared resilient across semiconductors, software and cybersecurity, though the outlook remained uneven in some areas. AI and autos underpin semiconductor sentiment AI and optical component suppliers were among the most upbeat.Nvidia\u2019s rackscale systems are now in full production, and demand for inference computing, estimated to require 20 times more resources than training continues to rise. Government-led AI initiatives are also contributing to broader momentum. Bank of America analysts cited growing confidence in a second-half rebound for diversified chipmakers.ON Semiconductor(NASDAQ:ON) said the downturn in automotive markets likely bottomed in the June quarter and projected stronger growth tied to industrial and EV-related demand through the rest of the year. Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) and Microchip (NASDAQ:MCHP) offered a more cautious tone, describing the recovery as in its early stages but one that could yield better operating leverage as volumes improve. Chip design firm Synopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS) is still evaluating the impact of new U.S. export restrictions. Equipment suppliers remained positive on prospects for leading-edge wafer fabrication investments. Software spending steady, AI pilots expand Software firms reported stable enterprise spending despite macroeconomic uncertainty.Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) cited continued weakness in manufacturing and retail, partly due to tariffs, but saw strength elsewhere. ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) and Salesforce reported active pilot programs for AI-driven tools, though these efforts have yet to produce significant revenue.Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) said adoption of its 365 Copilot product is growing, with usage now reaching \"hundreds of thousands\" of customers. Cybersecurity firms highlight stable demand, AI integration Cybersecurity spending remained steady despite broader volatility, BofA analysts said.Companies pointed to growing use of platform models and AI tools, both to improve threat detection and protect AI applications.

        "header": "1 Growth Stock That Could 5x Your Money in 10 Years",
        "content": "In most regards, retail investors are at a big disadvantage to professional investors working at hedge funds. They typically aren't as well-trained; they likely don't have as much time to conduct research or nearly the same amount of resources at their disposal. One major advantage, however, is that time is on their side. While hedge funds typically invest over a 12-to-18-month time horizon, retail investors can buy stocks they want to hold for five, 10, or even 20 years. This allows retail investors to buy stocks early and patiently wait for the catalysts to play out and for businesses to develop. Here's one stock to buy that can 5x your money in 10 years. When companies have serious ties to artificial intelligence (AI), their stocks are usually gobbled up before most retail investors take notice, resulting in stretched valuations that are often unappealing. But unlike most AI names, investors have had the chance all year to buyNebius Group(NBIS-6.21%)at very attractive or at least reasonable valuations. Image source: Getty Images. While investors have started to catch on and the stock is now up 70% this year, Nebius, at a $11.4 billion market cap, still presents a compelling long-term opportunity. Nebius builds data centers specifically aimed at helping customers launch AI solutions. The company's data centers purchase graphics processing units (GPUs) from major chip players likeNvidia, and then allow companies to essentially rent their infrastructure to build and run AI languages and applications on. For companies that would prefer to not have to set up their own AI infrastructure or need additional capacity, the arrangement is quite appealing. While this is Nebius' main business, the company also has some other smaller, developing businesses, like its generative AI development business, Toloka, and an autonomous driving technology business. The stock traded extremely cheaply when it rejoined the Nasdaq toward the end of last year, because it hadn't traded on the Nasdaq for close to three years. Nebius used to be owned by Russian internet giant Yandex. When Russia invaded Ukraine, U.S. sanctions on Russia led to the delisting of many Russian stocks. Since that time, however, Nebius split off from Yandex in a $5.4 billion deal that would see the company move its headquarters to Amsterdam. In December, Nebius announced that it had raised an oversubscribed private round of financing led by Nvidia and other major venture capital companies, which seemed to give the company more credibility and the market more confidence in the name. Nebius also has apartnership with Nvidia. This month, Nebius unveiled a flurry of positive news events. The company raised $1 billion in additional capital through convertible notes to accelerate growth and recently announced expansion in the United Kingdom, as well as the general availability of Nvidia's next-generation Blackwell chips in Europe. In the first quarter of the year, Nebius reported over $55 million of revenue, up 385% year over year, although the company's net loss grew 41% to close to $114 million. The company invested significantly in the quarter, and operating costs nearly doubled on a year-over-year basis, as capital expenditures (capex) and increased spending on data center hardware led to a more than fourfold increase in depreciation and amortization. However, Nebius is growing fast and has expanded its data center network, adding four new locations in Europe, the U.S., and the Middle East over the last three quarters, not including its planned GPU cluster in the United Kingdom. Furthermore, management said they remain on track to exit the year with $750 million to $1 billion of annual run-rate revenue. Management also said they expect to become positive on an adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) basis in the second half of this year. In the medium term, management projects to reach mid-single-digit billions of dollars in revenue, with adjusted EBIT margins in the 20%-30% range, assuming a four-year depreciation schedule. Obviously, the company still needs to execute, and the AI trade and AI capex could see some ebbs and flows and may not work in a straight line. But overall, Nebius is growing fast and meaningfully growing revenue, and its use case is resonating strongly in one of the most promising sectors of the market.",

        "header": "These 2 Nvidia Partners Will Power the Next Generation of Data Centers",
        "content": "The explosion in artificial intelligence (AI) demand is creating significant demand for data centers and the equipment that powers them. The leading AI computing platform provider,Nvidia(NVDA-2.20%), is developing the next generation of data center architecture. However, it's not doing it alone. Two of its key partners,Navitas Semiconductor(NVTS-6.08%)andVertiv(VRT-3.23%), are set to play a significant role. Here's the lowdown. Nvidia recently discussed the next-generation 800-volt (V) high-voltage direct current (HVDC) in ablog postand cited several key partners it is collaborating with to accelerate adoption. The change, from 54V DC data centers to 800V DC, is a game changer and is likely to result in the replacement of traditional 54V DC data centers used for AI and high-performance computing. Nvidia expects these new data centers to launch in 2027, so its partners must have solutions ready in time. In a traditional 54V DC data center, 13.8kV alternating current (AC) power (a voltage typically used to distribute power to neighborhoods or industrial facilities) enters the data center. It is then stepped down to a lower AC voltage. After that, the lower-voltage power is routed to IT racks, which contain power distribution units that convert it to 54V DC. From there, it's fed into another converter at the graphics processing units (GPUs) level, which converts it into an even lower DC voltage used to power the GPUs. The new 800V HVDC data centers help simplify the process by converting the 13.8kV AC power into 800V DC at the data center perimeter and then straight to the IT rack, where it's transformed into the lower voltages necessary to run GPUs. Nvidia believes that the new data centers will: Navitas had just $83.3 million in sales in 2024.  The announcement of its collaboration with Nvidia on 800V HVDC data center architecture sent the stock into orbit -- up over 100% so far this year. The gallium nitride (GaN) and silicon carbide (SiC) semiconductor company offers power conversion solutions that cover the entire power process in an 800V HVDC data center, from the initial conversion at the perimeter to the conversion from 800V DC to lower voltage at the IT rack. It's not alone in offering semiconductor solutions to Nvidia, and it's up against some powerful competition, such asInfineonandSTMicroelectronics(also Nvidia partners). However, it's a pure-play GaN and SiC company, and any significant revenue from 800V HVDC data center growth will move the needle for it. It's challenging to assign a valuation to Navitas, as its future growth prospects are far from clear. Still, the Nvidia backing is significant, and so is the upside potential of Navitas becoming a key provider to Nvidia. The transition to 800V HVDC data centers necessitates the development of new industrial-grade rectifiers to convert the 13.8kV AC grid power into 800V DC, as well as IT rack-level DC converters and backup systems, all of which are essential for providing a reliable power supply. That's where Vertiv comes in. The company plans to have its 800V HVDC solutions available in the second half of 2026, and in time for Nvidia's rollout of its Kyber and Rubin Ultra platforms for the new data centers. Just as with Navitas, Vertiv is competing with some heavyweight industrial companies, specificallyEatonandSchneider Electric. However, like Navitas, it is a pure-play company in the industry. The company was originally part ofEmerson Electricbut was sold to private equity in 2016, and then  came to the market in 2020. Image source: Getty Images. While there are some understandable concerns about AI/data center stocks overheating, the drive toward the new generation of data centers promises to create an expansion in Vertiv's total addressable market. Wall Street analyst expectations are for mid-teens revenue growth through 2027,  and with the next wave of 800V HVDC orders likely to happen in 2026 and then 2027, Vertiv looks set for substantial growth in the coming years.",

        "header": "Prediction: This Red-Hot Growth Stock Will Continue Soaring in the Second Half of 2025",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" gets a lot of attention -- and rightfully so -- as its components,Microsoft,Nvidia,Apple,Alphabet,Amazon,Meta Platforms, andTesla, have all produced massive gains in recent years and life-changing gains over the long term. But if there were a Magnificent Eight,Broadcom(AVGO-2.90%)would be the most deserving addition. The semiconductor giant sports a market cap of $1.2 trillion and has produced a mind-numbing 373% gain in just the last three years and is up 772% in the last five years. If there were a Magnificent Eight, Broadcom would be the second-best performer during the last three to five years -- behind only Nvidia. Here's why Broadcom has what it takes to continue soaring in the second half of 2025 and beyond. Image source: Getty Images. Broadcom's value has compounded so much in recent years because the company is an industry leader in global connectivity and benefits from growth in artificial intelligence (AI). Broadcom operates in several end markets, including cloud infrastructure, networking, cybersecurity, storage, broadband, wireless, and even solutions for hyperscale data centers. Its acquisition of VMware in late 2023 boosted Broadcom's exposure to infrastructure software. Broadcom's core business (including VMware) is a stable, consistent cash cow. But what's really driving investor excitement is likely Broadcom's AI business. In Broadcom's most recent quarter, which was second-quarter fiscal 2025, consolidated revenue grew 20% year over year, but AI semiconductor revenue jumped 46% to $4.4 billion -- representing 29% of total revenue. For context, Broadcom's AI revenue made up 25% of total revenue a year ago. So, the overall business is growing at an excellent pace, but AI is growing even faster. One of Broadcom's key AI products is its application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). ASICS are AI chips for data centers that can be lower-cost alternatives to graphics processing units (GPUs) because they can perform a specific function really well. In contrast, GPUs are basically catch-all workhorses for AI workflows. Broadcom's XPUs are custom ASIC chips designed for AI workloads. On its March earnings call, Broadcom said that it believes the serviceable addressable market for these chips will grow to $90 billion by fiscal 2027 as hyperscale customers go from clusters of 500,000 accelerators to 1 million accelerators. These larger clusters could potentially boost efficiency and performance, which would be a net benefit for cloud service providers. Fast-forward three months on its latest earnings call, and Broadcom said that it continues to expect a great deal of AI accelerator clusters to use its XPUs. It also expects AI semiconductor revenue in the current quarter to skyrocket to $5.1 billion, a 60% increase compared to third-quarter fiscal 2024. Another element of Broadcom's AI revenue is AI networking, led by Ethernet, which represented 40% of AI revenue in the recent quarter. Broadcom offers a comprehensive portfolio of AI networking tools such as routers, switches, and controllers. These tools can work hand-in-hand with servers, GPUs, and AI accelerators (like XPUs) to drive AI training and deployment. All told, Broadcom is well positioned to capture AI investment through its networking tools and its XPU chips. Meanwhile, the core business continues to deliver exceptional results. Broadcom is an excellent stock to buy and hold for investors who believe in sustained AI spending. Despite tariff pressure and geopolitical uncertainty, the vast majority of big tech companies and hyperscalers (many of which are Broadcom customers)didn't change their capital expenditure forecastswhen they reported earnings in April and early May. And if anything, some companies evenraised their capex forecasts-- a sign that AI spending wasn't phased by trade tensions. It's also worth mentioning that many of these big tech companies have exceptional balance sheets, allowing them to invest throughout the business cycle and limit boom and bust periods of spending. Broadcom is an impeccable business with growth opportunities across various end markets, including AI. But the stock is far from cheap -- sporting aforward price-to-earnings ratioof 38.7 -- which is even higher than Nvidia at 33.9. However, Broadcom is less of a pure-play company than Nvidia, which makes the vast majority of its earnings from GPUs for data centers. Broadcom also has a stable and growing dividend -- which it hasraised for 15 consecutive years. Even near an all-time high, Broadcom is worth a closer look for investors looking for a balanced tech company that benefits from AI but isn't solely dependent on AI to drive earnings growth. Although Broadcom could continue soaring in the second half of this year, it must continue delivering exceptional earnings growth to justify its expensive valuation. So, the best way to approach the stock is with at least a three- to five-year investment time horizon rather than hoping for quarterly outperformance.",

        "content": "A buy-and-hold portfolio built with Vanguard funds can be cost-efficient, diversified and ... More profitable.SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images Trying to predict where the market\u2019s headed amid geopolitical unrest and ever-changing tariff policies can be exhausting. Fortunately, you don't have to predict the future to make money investing. A diversified buy-and-hold portfolio plus a good dose of patience can help you reach your wealth goals without timing the market.   Vanguard funds are good candidates for buy-and-hold portfolios because they cover popular market segments, and many have low expense ratios. Whether you want a simple two-fund portfolio or something more complex, one or more of the six funds on this list can provide the diversified exposure you need.  The Best Vanguard Index Funds To Buy And Hold The table below introduces six Vanguard funds for the buy-and-hold investor. The first two funds, VTI and VOO, provide overlapping exposure to domestic stocks. Most investors will choose one of them as a core, anchor position. The other four funds provide complementary exposure for a well-diversified portfolio.   Some of these funds are also available as Vanguard mutual funds, which you may have access to in your 401(k).

Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI) The Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF represents the entire U.S. stock market, from small to large companies. The fund uses a sampling approach to replicate market returns. This helps keep costs lower versus owning every stock available. Even so, VTI holds more than 3,500 stocks and provides exposure to all economic sectors. VTI is an efficient pick for whole market exposure with its low expense ratio and low tracking error. Tracking error is the performance difference between the fund and its underlying index. VTI\u2019s tracking error on a NAV basis has historically been one or two basis points.  As a core stock holding, you could weight VTI as high as 90%\u2014assuming you can handle risk and you\u2019re not investing in other stock funds. More conservative investors would allocate 40% to 80% to VTI, depending on what else is in the portfolio.   VTI's average annual return over the past 10 years is 12.14%. The fund does pay quarterly dividends with a 30-day SEC yield of 1.24%. 2. Vanguard S&P 500 (VOO) The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF invests in the S&P 500, which includes the largest and most successful U.S. public companies. This fund is a popular choice for novice and experienced investors. According to ETF Database, VOO is the largest U.S. ETF as measured by assets under management. Compared to VTI, VOO is more heavily concentrated on big tech stocks. You\u2019d choose VOO as your core holding if you believe those mega-cap companies will continue their historic growth trajectories. In June 2024, a Morgan Stanley report noted that the Magnificent Seven stocks drove more than half of the S&P 500's 26.3% gain in 2023. Those stocks\u2014Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla\u2014have been less dominant in 2025, but it's hard to count them out. VOO allocation guidelines are the same as VTI\u2019s. Your exposure can range from 40% to 90%, depending on the rest of your portfolio and your risk tolerance. VOO has returned 12.81% annually on average over the past decade. The fund pays quarterly dividends, with a 30-day SEC yield of 1.24%. 3. Vanguard Small-Cap Value ETF (VBR) Vanguard Small-Cap Value ETF invests in more than 800 domestic small-cap companies. Industrials and financials are the top sectors in the portfolio, followed by consumer discretionary and real estate. Small caps suit a buy-and-hold portfolio because they have good growth potential and some volatility. Longer holding periods smooth out the rough edges and average to positive returns. Small-cap returns have outperformed large caps in multi-year cycles, but not since 2011. Analysts from investment firm Wellington Management and Chartered Financial Analyst Daniel Fang believe small caps will take the lead again soon. An 8% to 10% small-cap allocation is an appropriate starting point for buy-and-hold investors. Remember to consider the small-cap exposure you already have in a total market fund like VTI. VBR has delivered an average annual return of 7.84% since May 2015. The fund pays quarterly dividends with a 30-day SEC yield of 2.1%. 4. Vanguard Total International Stock ETF (VXUS) The Vanguard Total International Stock ETF invests in more than 8,000 foreign large-cap companies. The fund tracks the FTSE Global Call Cap ex US Index, which includes stocks from emerging and developed markets. Investing outside the U.S. can provide access to lower valuations and potentially higher growth potential. There can be more volatility, too, which underscores the importance of diversification and long holding periods. Buying and holding a broad international fund like VXUS checks both boxes. Charles Schwab recommends an international stock allocation of 5% to 40%, but many investors will opt for 10% to 20%. The David Swensen Portfolio uses a 15% allocation. Swensen formerly managed Yale University\u2019s endowment fund, famously growing it from $1 billion to $31 billion. VXUS has produced an average annual return of 5.6% since May of 2015. 5. Vanguard Real Estate Fund (VNQ) The Vanguard Real Estate Fund offers growth and income potential through its real estate investment trusts (REIT) holdings. The fund tracks the MSCI US Investable Market Real Estate 25/50 index. The index includes about 150 small, mid and large-cap REITs, and the top holding comprises less than 7% of the portfolio. REITs often pay high dividend yields because they distribute 90% of their income to shareholders. A related perk is that REITs do not pay corporate taxes on the distributed income. So REIT investors sidestep the double taxation that occurs with non-REIT companies\u2014when profits are taxed at the corporate level and again with shareholder dividends. A REIT fund also provides access to the real estate market, which typically doesn\u2019t move in lockstep with stocks. This provides a nice diversification benefit, alongside good returns. The FTSE Nareit All REIT index produced a pretax average annual return of 11.1% between 1972 and 2024, according to data provided by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (Nareit). A Morningstar analysis concludes that a portfolio with 51% stocks, 34% bonds and 15% REITs outperformed a 60-40 split between stocks and bonds more than half the time between 1976 and 2022. A typical REIT allocation would be 5% to 15%. VNQ pays quarterly distributions. The total distributions over the past 12 months were $3.63, which equates to a yield of about 4%. 6. Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (BND) The Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF invests in investment-grade, intermediate-term U.S. bonds. Tax-exempt bonds and TIPS are excluded. Treasury bonds comprise nearly half of the portfolio, with government mortgage-backed securities and corporate bonds making up another 44%. Bonds provide income and relative price stability, two traits that complement stocks. Your allocation to this fund should depend on your risk tolerance. If you don\u2019t like risk, opt for higher bond exposure\u2014say, 50% of your portfolio. If you are comfortable with the volatile nature of stocks, your bond exposure could be as low as 10%. BND pays monthly distributions with a 30-day SEC yield of 4.47%. Bottom Line  A buy-and-hold portfolio built with Vanguard funds can be cost-efficient, diversified and profitable. Start by setting target allocations for different asset types\u2014from large caps to REITs and bonds\u2014based on your risk tolerance. Then plug matching funds into your allocation formula and wait for your returns to build over time.

(NYSE:IONQ) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses. IonQ, Inc. (NYSE:IONQ) is one of the few pure-play American quantum computing hardware companies. The firm was a regular feature of Cramer\u2019s appearances earlier this year in January. Back then, the quantum computing sector was basking in the glory of Google\u2019s announcement that its quantum computer had significantly outperformed a supercomputer. Investors started piling into quantum computing stocks, but Cramer remained a skeptic. Back then, NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang knocked the wind out of the quantum computing bubble after he remarked that the technology wasn\u2019t mature. Yet, in a turn of events in late May, IonQ, Inc. (NYSE:IONQ)\u2019s shares surged by 22% after its CEO commented in an interview that his firm could be the \u2018NVIDIA\u2019 of quantum computing. Cramer\u2019s comments revolved around NVIDIA\u2019s CEO changing tack on quantum computing: \u201cThere are four quantum stocks that we have to follow. Some of my people that I work with were very, I think that they were, probably concerned that I went out and said, look we ought to be looking at . . .we ought to be looking at, you know the ones that people talk about. But they\u2019re gonna fly!\u201d A quantum computer on a countertop in an engineering laboratory with a technician at work. Recently, Cramer commented on IonQ, Inc. (NYSE:IONQ)\u2019s valuation: \u201cOh my god, it\u2019s so high and it\u2019s losing so much money, but it\u2019s quantum. If I offer you a considered explanation of why I think that stock\u2019s too expensive, most people ignore it, so all I\u2019m going to say is it\u2019s too speculative for me. I don\u2019t know what else to say.\u201d While we acknowledge the potential of IONQ as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), the world\u2019s largest AI GPU company, is a regular feature on Cramer\u2019s show. The CNBC host\u2019s opinion about the firm has continued to evolve this year. Ahead of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s conference in January, Cramer was optimistic about AI demand. After the conference, he wondered whether NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) could experience demand from humanoid robots as well. Yet, once the stock bled close to $600 billion in value after the DeepSeek selloff, he remarked that it was too early to comment on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)\u2019s future. More recently, he\u2019s back to being bullish and continues to believe that the market is treating the firm unfairly. His latest comments about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) revolved around quantum computing and trade negotiations: \u201cUh, but, there\u2019s, you might see NVIDIA going up here. Now, NVIDIA gave a very good talk, this was Jensen\u2019s time to go. Uh, sovereign AI again. . . but I have to tell you Carl, here it goes again, I talked about it last night at the top of the show.

(NASDAQ:MU) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses. Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) is one of the largest computer memory chip manufacturers in the world. It is also the only American firm that manufactures the advanced chips. Consequently, Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) plays a key role in the AI supply chain. Its shares soared by 25% in January after NVIDIA revealed that it was a supply chain partner for AI GPU chips. Year-to-date, Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU)\u2019s stock has gained 32%. The stock has gained 22% in June alone after the firm benefited from NVIDIA taking a lesser-than-expected revenue hit from US chip sanctions against China. Cramer\u2019s comments about Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) revolved around President Trump\u2019s trade negotiations: \u201cAnd the Chinese did have a kind of discouraging statement talking about how, look, you know we\u2019ll take it till we have to fight. When I say on the semiconductors, a lot of people feel it was in Advanced Micro, cause they have a GPU that you need, that\u2019s what NVIDIA have. Advanced Micro\u2019s up a quick ten.

        "content": "Nvidia(NVDA-2.20%)has been a no-brainer choice for investors aiming to win in the artificial intelligence (AI) market. The stock has soared 1,500% over the past five years as this AI chip leader delivered quarter after quarter of record revenue growth -- and this story is far from over. Nvidia's market dominance and innovation shouldhelp it to benefitas the AI boom continues. But some billionaires have decided to move on, selling some or all of their Nvidia shares and focusing on other potential AI winners. For example, Stanley Druckenmiller of the Duquesne Family Office soldall his Nvidia sharesin the third quarter of last year. Just recently, David Tepper of Appaloosa and Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management cut their positions in Nvidia. As some investors reduce exposure to the top chipmaker, another AI stock, one that's climbed nearly 300% over the past three years, is emerging as an investor favorite. Let's check it out. Image source: Getty Images. The stock I'm talking about is among the top five stock holdings of Tepper, and it's the No. 1 stock holding of Laffont, as well as fellow billionaires Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management and Stephen Mandel Jr. of Lone Pine Capital. Ole Andreas Halvorsen of Viking Global Investors is also bullish on this stock, opening a position in the first quarter of this year. This player that's been much sought after by billionaires in recent times isMeta Platforms(META-1.70%), a company you are probably very familiar with thanks to its social media dominance. Meta owns Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp -- more than 3.4 billion people worldwide use at least one of these apps daily. Here's how billionaires Tepper, who oversees $8.3 billion, and Laffont, who manages $22 billion,\u00a0took action on Nvidia and Meta in the first quarter: Considering these moves and Meta's top spot in the portfolios of other billionaires, it's clear these expert investors see the company as a potential winner in the AI revolution. You may be wondering why this is the case, given that Meta is best known for its strengths in the social media industry. Well, Meta has also been building AI expertise in the form of its own large language model (LLM), Llama, to power innovations that may ensure its leadership in social media -- and, therefore, revenue growth. Here's how that works. Meta generates the lion's share of its revenue from advertisers across its social media apps. And through tools like AI assistants, Meta aims to keep us spending more time on the apps, prompting advertisers to pour more investment into advertising there to reach us. Meta AI, the company's current offering, is currently the world's most widely used AI assistant. On top of this, Meta's innovations in AI could lead to other products and services that boost revenue down the road. Meta clearly believes in the saying \"go big or go home,\" as the company expects to reach as much as $72 billion in capital spending this year to support its AI ambitions. Now the question is: Should you follow the billionaires and buy shares of Meta? The stock trades for 27 timesforward earnings estimates, making it more expensive than it was a couple of months ago when it fell to less than 20 times expected earnings. But this remains a reasonable valuation for a growth stock, particularly a profitable, well-established player that offers a secure revenue stream and even dividend payments. The next question is, in the AI boom, should you favor Meta over Nvidia? Investors who have already won on their Nvidia investment over time, such as certain billionaires, may rotate out of the stock and into Meta. Ramping up its AI investment, Meta could be well positioned to deliver gains in the quarters to come. Meta is also slightly cheaper than Nvidia, which today trades for 33 times forward earnings estimates. So, if you don't have any Meta shares yet, you may want to get in on this exciting story -- but you don't necessarily have to forget about Nvidia. The best strategy may be to hold shares of both of these AI leaders as the AI boom enters its next chapter.",

        "content": "Nvidia(NVDA-2.20%)andPalantir Technologies(PLTR1.72%)have been two of the stock market's biggest winners over the past couple of years -- they even delivered the best performances in theDow Jones Industrial Averageand theS&P 500, respectively, in 2024. Investors love these stocks for their positions in the high-growth artificial intelligence (AI) market. Nvidia is the world's leading AI chip designer, and Palantir sells a popular AI-driven software platform that helps customers make better use of their data. Both of these companies have reported soaring revenue and demand, and long-term prospects look bright as well. But Wall Street only recommends buyingoneof these players. According to Wall Street's average price forecast, one of these stocks is expected to climb nearly 20% in the next 12 months, while the other is expected to decline by 25%. Let's take a closer look at each and then find out which one Wall Street favors right now. Image source: Getty Images. Nvidia is the world's AI chip leader, offeringgraphics processing units (GPUs)that outperform all others on the market. They're pricier than rivals, but the company says that over time, gains in efficiency result in lower total cost of ownership. So, Nvidia GPUs may actually be the least expensive option for customers if they commit to them over the long run. Nvidia hasn't had to worry about attracting customers, though. Demand for its latest architecture and chip, Blackwell, surpassed supply as the platform launched a few months ago. Blackwell delivered $11 billion in revenue during its first quarter on the market. And Nvidia's pledge to update its chips on an annual basis should keep this growth going. Of course, the AI giant faces rivals, such asAdvanced Micro Devices, and even Nvidia's own customers, in some cases, have become rivals as they make their own chips. (They haven't abandoned Nvidia but are using their own chips in addition to Nvidia GPUs.) Still, there's enough demand in the growing AI market to allow Nvidia to remain on top and for others to succeed as well. Palantir's business may not seem too exciting at first: The company offers software, driven by AI, that aggregates a customer's disparate data and puts it to work. But what sounds simple or mundane is actually driving some pretty exciting results. For example, on a battlefield, it's helping the military make faster and better decisions. As for commercial use, customerRio Tintosays Palantir's software, by accessing unstructured data, is helping it tackle problems it never thought possible. In Palantir's early days, governments were its biggest customers, but in recent times, commercial growth has taken off. Companies across sectors are rushing to Palantir's Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) to help them solve problems or implement new processes and strategies. In the latest quarter, Palantir's commercial business delivered double-digit revenue growth, and the government business has continued to do the same. So, Palantir has two high-growth businesses, and considering the company's comments about recent demand, there's reason to be optimistic about the future. The one problem with investing in Palantir is the stock's valuation. It trades for a lofty 232 timesforward earnings estimates. But it's important to remember that this only considers earnings expected next year and doesn't account for the company's prospects over the long run. Now, which of these two does Wall Street recommend buying? About 30 Wall Street firms have a positive recommendation, such as buy or outperform, on Nvidia, and the average 12-month price forecast indicates a gain of 19% from the closing price on June 12. As for Palantir, nine Wall Street analysts have a neutral or negative rating on the stock, and only two -- Wedbush and Bank of America Securities -- have positive recommendations on the shares. The average price forecast implies a 25% decline for the stock over the next 12 months. So, Wall Street clearly recommends buying Nvidia over Palantir, and much of this is linked to Palantir'ssteep valuation. Considering all the points above, Nvidia does stand out as the better buy right now for most AI investors, especially if you're cautious or focus on value. Aggressive investors, though, may still want to add some Palantir to their holdings. The company's earnings continue to march higher, demand is strong, and the AI market is booming -- and all this may create the recipe for a long-term win for Palantir shareholders, even those who buy at today's price.",

        "header": "2 Top Stocks to Profit Off the AI and Cryptocurrency Booms",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) and cryptocurrency are two high-growth markets that offer promising return potential. Investing in the right stocks could pay off handsomely in the coming years. Here are two stocks that could deliver. Image source: Getty Images. AI is expected to increase the global economy by $15.7 trillion by 2030, according to PwC. This is a huge opportunity for one of the leading chipmakers,Advanced Micro Devices(AMD-1.98%). AMD stockpulled back sharply to start the year, but it has begun to recover. The business is set to supply a leading AI company with its new chips, which could benefit the stock. The last few years have seen a lot of chip investment go towardAI training, which is the process of feeding large data sets to AI models to make them smarter.Nvidiacapitalized on the demand for AI training with itsgraphics processing units (GPUs). While AMD was late to the party, its first data center GPU, the MI300, was launched in late 2023 and raked in $5 billion of revenue last year. Management still sees a $500 billion opportunity\u00a0as it launches new GPUs designed forAI inferencing, which takes a model to the next level by teaching it to make decisions on its own from new data. This is expected to be a huge market, and AMD has positioned its new chip lineup to take advantage of the opportunity. The company reported accelerating revenue growth last quarter, with data center revenue up 57% year over year. It gained business from one of the leading AI model developers that is using its Instinct GPUs for daily inferencing needs. AMD will launch its Instinct MI400 GPU in 2026, and OpenAI just announced plans to use the chip. This is a huge win and signals growing momentum for its data center business. Demand for AI inferencing hardware is expected to grow from $106 billion in 2025 to $255 billion by 2030, according to MarketsandMarkets. AMD is well positioned for this opportunity, making the recent dip a great buying opportunity. Image source: Getty Images. The cryptocurrency market was worth more than $3 trillion as of June 12, yet only 7% of the global population uses cryptocurrency, according to the crypto exchange Kraken.  As interest in digital currencies continues to grow,Coinbase Global(COIN0.58%)could grow along with it. Coinbase is a leading cryptocurrency exchange with more than $300 billion in assets on the platform. It saw a sharp increase in revenue last year as trading volumes soared, which has sent the stock up nearly 600% since 2022. But the shares have been volatile over the last few years, reflecting the downturn in the markets a few years ago. The risk for holding the stock is when markets decline, trading volumes drop, which depresses revenue. However, Coinbase has a lot of opportunity to attract more assets to its platform. It is expanding the number of trading products and services to appeal to institutional investors, which make up the majority of its trading volume. Its push into crypto options andstablecoins, as well as improvements to its trading infrastructure are positioning it to attract more customers. As demand for digital assets continues to grow, the exchange should see increasing trading volumes and revenue. And there are strong signals pointing to rising demand for cryptocurrencies over the long term. A recent report from Coinbase showed that 60% of Fortune 500 executives are working onblockchaininitiatives, which serve as the digital ledger for crypto transactions. Another strong signal supporting the long-term future of the market was President Donald Trump's recent executive order to establish aStrategicBitcoinReservefor the U.S. government. These are bullish indicators for crypto and Coinbase. There are a lot of places to buy and sell cryptocurrency, but Coinbase is on a mission to become not just a leading crypto exchange but also a leading financial services platform. This makes the stock a great way to benefit from this booming market.",

        "content": "Saving money concept Man hand putting Row and coin Write Finance Saving money concept Man hand ... More putting Row and coin Write Financegetty I\u2019m just going to come out and say it: If you want to be financially independent (and who doesn\u2019t?), you must own closed-end funds (CEFs).  For those \u201cin the know\u201d about CEFs, the reason is simple: massive yields. As I write, closed-end funds yield 9.1% on average. And game-changing dividends like that are only one way CEFs reward us\u2014and I\u2019d argue they\u2019re not even the best one!   The best-in-class CEFs out there\u2014and here I\u2019d definitely include the three we\u2019re going to get into below\u2014also offer strong total returns, with price gains and dividends combining to hand us overall returns of 10%+ yearly.  And with CEFs, we get a solid indication of when those returns may start to build. It\u2019s an easy-to-find indicator called the discount to net asset value (NAV).   This discount stems from a key difference between CEFs and ETFs: CEFs can\u2019t issue new shares to new investors post-IPO, so their market prices are often different (and regularly lower) than their per-share portfolio values (their NAV, in other words). So if, say, you buy a CEF with a 10% discount, you\u2019re buying its portfolio for 10% less than you could if you bought its holdings on the open market. This sets up a nice \u201crinse-and-repeat\u201d cycle for us: We buy a discounted CEF, collect its huge income stream, then sell at a premium down the road. MORE FOR YOUSamsung Suddenly Raises Trade-In Prices In Rare New OfferToday\u2019s NYT Mini Crossword Clues And Answers For Saturday, June 14th\u2018How To Train Your Dragon\u2019 Just Set A Rotten Tomatoes Audience Score Record  Of course, these kinds of opportunities don\u2019t tend to last, and in the last year we\u2019ve seen more CEFs trade at smaller discounts as investors start to clue in. But investors are focusing very tightly on quality here, given recent uncertainty. That\u2019s got them zeroing in on only those CEFs with strong track records. There are, however, some gems that have been left behind. Let\u2019s look at three. Overlooked CEF No. 1: A Global Income Play Selling for 8% \u201cBelow Retail\u201d First up is the Eaton Vance Tax-Advantaged Global Dividend Opportunities Fund (ETO), which should attract a fat premium given the interest in global stocks these days. Yet ETO, with a mix of American mega-caps like NVIDIA (NVDA) and foreign powerhouses like AstraZeneca (AZN), trades at a fat 8.7% discount today. That\u2019s despite its generous 7.9% dividend, which should be getting more attention. So, by the way, should the fund\u2019s performance. ETO Total ReturnsYcharts   Beyond the discount and dividend, ETO\u2019s 12.3% annualized return on NAV (orange line above) should also be a shiny lure for investors. But as you can see, ETO\u2019s market price\u2013based total return (in purple) has lagged, inflating its discount from where it was a half-decade ago. That\u2019s clearly an error on the market\u2019s part, and it makes ETO well worth a look today. Overlooked CEF No. 2: Get in on \u201cPricey\u201d US Stocks at a 7.8% Discount We\u2019ll find an even bigger discrepancy with the Eaton Vance Tax-Managed Buy-Write Income Fund (ETB), a 9.1%-yielder holding S&P 500 mainstays like Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), NVIDIA (NVDA), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A).  This high-powered roster should put ETB on investors\u2019 radar, yet the gap between its total NAV return (in orange below) and total price return (in purple) is huge.ETB Total ReturnsYcharts With a 11.3% annualized return over the last half-decade (based on NAV), ETB\u2019s managers have clearly done their job. Yet investors have taken little notice, causing its market price\u2013based return to lag, and its discount to widen to 7.8%. Completing the picture is the fact that ETB has averaged a 1.7% premium in the last decade. That gives it plenty of upside as its overdone discount flips to the fund\u2019s \u201cnormal\u201d premium. Overlooked CEF No. 3: A Finance Fund With a \u201cDiscount in Disguise\u201d Finally, consider the John Hancock Financial Opportunities Fund (BTO), which subscribers to my CEF Insider service might remember. We\u2019ve held BTO twice in the past and have booked nice double-digit total returns both times. BTO, which yields 7.5%, focuses on the financial sector, mainly banking firms, with M&T Bank (MTB), Mississippi-based Renasant Corp. (RNST) and US Bancorp (USB) all top holdings.BTO Total ReturnsYcharts These stocks have given BTO a sprightly 18.4% annualized return on NAV (in purple above) in the last five years. Yet its NAV return is only slightly ahead of its market price\u2013based return (in purple). This shows that investors are hesitant to sharply bid up the fund. This is an interesting chart: BTO is priced at a 5.5% premium currently, which sounds pricey but is actually a deal given the fund\u2019s long-term trend, which includes a premium that\u2019s hit double digits several times in the last decade. Investors have picked up on this, which is why BTO\u2019s pricing went from around par earlier this year to today\u2019s premium. Expect that premium to keep growing, especially if the stock market keeps rising, as well. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

        "content": "For more than two years, the evolution ofartificial intelligence (AI)has dominated the investment landscape. The capacity for AI-empowered software and systems to make split-second decisions without the aid of humans is a technology that can provide operating efficiencies throughout most industries around the globe. InSizing the Prize, the analysts at PwC pegged this global addressable market for AI at $15.7 trillion by the turn of the decade. Even if this estimate is just somewhat in the ballpark, it points to a game-changing trend that can positively impact a long list of businesses. Image source: Getty Images. However, no company has more directly benefited from the rise of artificial intelligence thanNvidia(NVDA-2.20%). It took less than two years for Nvidia's market cap to catapult by more than $3 trillion, and for it to, briefly, become the most valuable publicly traded company. While it would appear that nothing can go wrong for Nvidia,historical precedent would beg to differ. A decade from now, Nvidia stock coming back to Earth, coupled with steady growth from other magnificent businesses, can lead to three non-tech stocks blowing past Wall Street's AI darling in the market cap column. Let me preface this discussion bygiving Nvidia credit where credit is due. Its Hopper graphics processing units (GPUs) and successor Blackwell GPU architecture account for the lion's share of GPUs deployed in enterprise AI-accelerated data centers. It's a testament that Nvidia is producing a superior product that's clearly outpacing its direct external rivals in compute potential. Nvidia also took advantage of economic scarcity. With demand for AI GPUs handily outpacing their supply, and world-leading chip fabrication companyTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturingunable to expand its production capacity fast enough to satiate demand, Nvidia's hardware is commanding a 100%-plus premium to rival chips. There's a reason Nvidia'sgross margintopped 70% throughout fiscal 2025 (its fiscal year ends in late January). But there's a historical headwind that's lies undefeated since the mid-1990s, and it squarely has artificial intelligence and Nvidia in its proverbial sight. Every next-big-thing technology and innovation for more than 30 yearshas endured a bubble-bursting event early in its expansion. In other words, investors have been consistently overestimating the adoption rate and/or utility of game-changing trends for decades -- and AI looks to be no exception. Most businesses deploying AI solutions haven't optimized them and aren't generating a positive return on their AI investments. If history rhymes once more, and an AI bubble were to form and burst, Nvidia would almost certainly be one of the biggest losers. This isn't to say Nvidia won't be wildly successful after artificial intelligence matures as a technology. Rather, it points to the historical precedent that market leaders of next-big-thing trends always falter in the early going due to the overzealousness of investors. However, the following three non-tech titans all have the tools and intangibles needed to leapfrog Nvidia's valuation over the next 10 years. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool. Though non-tech companies tend to dominate the trillion-dollar ranks, it's Warren Buffett's company,Berkshire Hathaway(BRK.A-0.52%)(BRK.B-0.77%), which seems likeliest to surpass Nvidia's market cap by 2035. Even though theOracle of Omaha is stepping down from his role as CEO by the end of this yearand handing the reins over to Greg Abel, a foundation has been laid that can sustain double-digit returns for Berkshire Hathaway's stock. One reason Berkshire stock has delivered an annualized return of almost 20% spanning 60 years is because Buffett and his team have focused on cyclical businesses. Instead of trying to time when inevitable recessions will occur, Buffett has packed his company's $280 billion investment portfolio and owned assets with businesses thatcan take advantage of nonlinear periods of growth. With the average U.S. recession since World War II lasting just 10 months and the typical expansion enduring for five years, Buffett and his crew simply need to exercise patience and allow time to work its magic. Warren Buffett also has a penchant for diving into dividend stocks. Companies that pay a regular dividend have historically run circles around their non-paying peers in the return column over the last half-century. Berkshire appears to be on track to collect more than $5 billion in dividend income this year alone. Don't overlook Berkshire's phenomenal buyback program, either. Despite Buffett going cold turkey on share repurchases for three consecutive quarters,he spent close to $78 billion, in aggregate, buying back his own company's stock from July 1, 2018 to June 30, 2024. These buybacks have helped to boost Berkshire's earnings per share and made its stock more attractive. A second non-tech stock thatcan blow past Nvidia's valuation over the coming 10 yearsis none other than payment-processing leaderVisa(V-5.01%). Visa's current market cap of $715 billion places it more than $2.7 trillion behind Nvidia. One of Visa's core catalysts is shared with Berkshire Hathaway: the disproportionate nature of economic cycles. With periods of growth lasting considerably longer than downturns, Visa is able to benefit from consumers and businesses increasing their spending over time. Something else that helps set Visa apart within thefinancial sectoris its general avoidance of lending. Though companies that choose to process payments and lend can double-dip during periods of growth, it also exposes these double dippers to credit delinquencies and loan losses during recessions and sluggish periods of economic expansion. With Visa shying away from lending, it doesn't have to worry about setting aside capital. In short, Visa bounces back from downturns quicker than most financial stocks. Arguably thebiggest opportunity for Visa exists beyond domestic borders. Cross-border payment volume has been consistently growing by a double-digit percentage annually, which is reflective of how underbanked most emerging markets are. This is a company that has the cash flow and balance sheet to organically or acquisitively enter new markets and sustain a double-digit sales and earnings growth rate. The icing on the cake is that Visa dominates domestically. The roughly $6.45 trillion in credit card network purchasing volume it handled in 2023 is approximately $2.4 trillion more than its three closest competitors,combined. Visa's U.S. cash flow is rock-solid and predictable. The third non-tech stock with the tools and intangibles to fully leapfrog Nvidia's market cap by 2035 isretail powerhouseWalmart(WMT-0.41%). Walmart's $765 billion market cap leaves it about $2.7 trillion away from Nvidia as well. Walmart's easily identifiable competitive edge is its size. Its steady operating cash flow and deep pockets allow it to purchase products in bulk. When buying large quantities of goods, Walmart is able to negotiate a lower per-unit cost, which in turn allows it to undercut local stores and national grocers on price. Walmart offers a value proposition that speaks to consumers. But Walmart is also an innovator. Management has beenaggressively investing in its online presence and ramping up its membership platform(Walmart+) in an effort to boost organic growth and its margins. During its fiscal first quarter (ended April 30), global e-commerce sales surged 22%, with U.S. e-commerce delivering its first quarter of profitability. Furthermore, membership income jumped by nearly 15%. Similar toCostco Wholesale's membership model, membership fees flow to the bottom line and allow Walmart to be more aggressive with its pricing on traffic-driving goods. Accepting lower margins on select groceries gets consumers in its stores or locked within its ecosystem where they can make higher-margin discretionary purchases. Lastly, and to build on the point above, Walmart provides basic need goods, such as food, toiletries, and household cleaning products. It's going to draw consumers in any economic climate, and is fully capable of generating predictable cash flow year after year.",

        "header": "Can Nvidia Stock Double in 5 Years?",
        "content": "Nvidia(NVDA-2.20%)has delivered extreme wealth for early investors, but it's also rewarded investors who bought shares fairly recently. Although it's been under pressure this year, it's up more than 740% over the past three years. That's far more than double. Buying Nvidia stock today would be a no-brainer for anyone who thinks it can replicate that success. But it wouldn't even have to achieve such a rare feat to be valuable to investors. If it doubles five years from now, it would likely beat the market and be a very valuable addition to almost any portfolio. Let's see if that might be in the cards. Image source: Nvidia. Nvidia has had an unbelievable run over the past few years sincegenerative artificial intelligence(AI) became the hottest thing since sliced bread. Tech companies are racing to develop the most competitive AI platform or integrate some aspect of AI into their user interfaces. Companies now offer AI-generated content, images, summaries, and more, and they're using agentic AI to get more stuff done with less human intervention. What's common to all of these applications is that they need powerful chips to make the magic happen. There are two basic parts of bringing generative AI to life. One is training, or the input stage, where large language models (LLM) scan tons of data to build their knowledge base. The other is inference, where the LLMs \"infer\" what's being asked or prompted to deliver the required output. Nvidia also services other industries with its powerful platform, including gaming, which is what drove higher sales before generative AI heated up. Nvidia has been unstoppable. In thefiscal 2026first quarter (ended April 27), sales increased 69% over last year. Earnings per share (EPS) were $0.81, including a charge it took for shipments it couldn't send to China because of U.S. policy. Even with the $0.15-per-share impact, Nvidia's EPS were well above last year's figure. As LLMs become more stable and effective, they're now going past inference to reasoning, which is a more developed stage of inference that takes a bit longer, but produces better results. Instead of popping out instant answers, LLMs that use reasoning might take a few seconds to \"think\" and then respond. To keep up with the ever-increasing demands for powerhouse chips, Nvidia continues to develop more powerful technology. The Blackwell model has given way to Blackwell Ultra, and Nvidia is planning on launching new technology, called Rubin, in 2026. \"AI inference token generation has surged tenfold in just one year,\" CEO Jensen Huang said, \"and as AI agents become mainstream, the demand for AI computing will accelerate.\" Clients use these chips to power huge data centers where all of this is taking place, and big AI-using companies likeAmazon,Microsoft, andMeta Platformsare building data centers. Nvidia's data center revenue outpaced total revenue in the first quarter, up 73% from last year. Nvidia has the best and most powerful chips, and it has the lead in this market by a wide margin. Estimates put it somewhere between 70% and 95% of the AI chip market, and as the opportunity grows, it's easy to see how much it could benefit Nvidia. Despite its lofty ambitions and premier performance, Nvidia stock isn't very expensive. At the current price, it trades at only 25 of next year's earnings estimates. That gives the stock extra room to increase without becoming unreasonably expensive, making it easier to imagine scenarios where it can double your money. From a sales perspective, it's fairly expensive, trading at 23 times trailing-12-month sales. That's a premium valuation for the growth that it has reported. To imagine doubling your money, you'd have to keep that ratio constant, because it isn't likely to rise. Keeping it constant, Nvidia would have to report a compound annual growth rate of 15% to double over five years. That seems very doable, considering its current performance and future opportunities. And even if it can't sustain such a highprice-to-sales ratio, it can probably achieve higher than 15% growth over the next five years, which means it can double even at a lower ratio. All this means Nvidia stock is likely to double over the next five years -- and it's very possible that it could do it even sooner.",

        "header": "Should You Forget Nvidia and Buy These 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Instead?",
        "content": "Up by about 26,000% over the past decade (as of this writing),Nvidia(NVDA-2.20%)has been a monster stock for investors. Its market capitalization has grown to about $3.5 trillion, making it one of the two most valuable companies in the world, neck-and-neck withMicrosoft. The stock's performance, meanwhile, has been well justified. The company's sales and earnings have grown explosively over that decade -- and particularly in the past few years as itsgraphics processing units (GPUs)have become the backbone of theartificial intelligence (AI)infrastructure build-out. The company's ongoing spectacular growth could be seen in its fiscal Q1 results: The $39.1 billion in data center revenue it booked was more than 9 times the $4.3 billion in data center revenue it generated in its Q1 just two years prior. Make no mistake, Nvidia remains one of the best-positioned companies to continue to benefit from the ongoing AI boom. However, the company is now massive, and as the base used to measure its growth gets bigger, the percentage gains are likely to get smaller because comparisons will get tougher. Investors shouldn't be surprised if percentage growth rates decline. For investors looking to diversify their AI infrastructure exposure or find investments with potentially more upside than Nvidia,Advanced Micro Devices(AMD-1.98%)andBroadcom(AVGO-2.90%)are two strong alternatives. Here's why. Image source: Getty Images While Nvidia's GPUs dominate the market for AI training chips, AMD has carved out a niche inAI inference, which is expected to become the much larger market over time. Nvidia's CUDA platform gives it a clear edge in AI model training, thanks to its broad hardware support, strong documentation, developer loyalty, and a deep library of AI tools that are already built and optimized to boost its GPU performance. However, once models are trained, running them (inference) is more about cost, latency, and efficiency. AMD's ROCm software has steadily improved, and while it still lags far behind CUDA for training, it's generally considered good enough for running inference workloads. That's important because inference demand is starting to accelerate, and cost-effectiveness plays a much bigger role in chip selection. On its latest earnings call, AMD said one of the largest AI model companies is now using its GPUs to handle a significant share of its daily inference traffic. Major cloud computing providers are also turning to AMD's GPUs to power search, recommendations, and generative AI tasks. Importantly, AMD won't need to take a massive share of the market from Nvidia to see big results. Its data center GPU revenue base is comparatively small, so even modest market share gains could drive strong growth. Beyond GPUs, AMD has become a leader in the market for data centercentral processing units (CPUs). While this market is smaller than the GPU market, CPUs -- the \"brains\" of the server -- remain critical, and AMD should continue to see solid overall data center CPU growth as AI infrastructure spending continues to increase. If AI workloads continue shifting toward inference, AMD is well-positioned to see faster growth and potentially outperform, especially given its much smaller revenue base. The biggest risk is if AI spending begins to slow and if the company's hardware continues to remain an afterthought to Nvidia's. That said, the setup looks good for AMD to outperform. Broadcom is both a hardware and software AI growth story. On the hardware side, Broadcom makes critical components for AI clusters, including Ethernet switches, optical receivers, DSPs, and NICs, which are all essential for moving huge amounts of data across large AI systems. As AI clusters grow in size and complexity, the offerings in Broadcom's networking portfolio are becoming increasingly valuable. In fact, its AI networking revenue jumped 170% last quarter and now makes up 40% of its AI revenue. The bigger prize, though, is in application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). These custom chips are designed for specific use cases, offering their buyers better performance and lower power usage than off-the-shelf GPUs. As such, some larger companies are beginning to turn to custom AI chips to supplement their GPUs. Broadcom first helpedAlphabetdesign its tensor processing units (TPUs), which were specifically developed to optimize AI workloads within Google Cloud's TensorFlow framework. Those chips' success has inspired more customers (includingApple) to turn to Broadcom to help them develop their own custom AI chips. Needless to say, this opportunity appears massive. In the past, Broadcom has said its three most advanced AI chip customers could each deploy 1 million AI chip clusters by 2027, representing a total addressable opportunity of up to $90 billion. While production of Alphabet's ASICs is fully ramped up, other large customers are just getting started. As such, Broadcom is looking at a potential multiyear revenue surge. While much of the attention around Broadcom revolves around its hardware business, its VMware unit is also quietly benefiting from AI. VMware's Cloud Foundation platform, which helps customers manage AI workloads across public clouds and their own on-premises servers, is seeing strong adoption as enterprises move toward hybrid and multicloud AI environments. Broadcom has also been transforming VMware (which it acquired in late 2023) by streamlining its product offerings and shifting it to a subscription sales model. Between its networking portfolio, custom AI chips, and VMware, Broadcom is well-positioned to achieve strong AI-related revenue growth in the coming years. If Nvidia is the AI infrastructure king, then AMD and Broadcom are its best challengers on the chessboard. AMD is building momentum in AI inference and remains a leader in data center CPUs. Broadcom, meanwhile, is powering AI infrastructure through its combination of networking hardware, custom chips, and enterprise virtualization software. Both companies offer unique angles on the AI build-out, and both stocks have strong growth potential. For investors looking to bet on the AI trend without simply buying more shares of Nvidia, AMD and Broadcom are two high-quality, high-upside stocks to consider.",

        "content": "The full article continues below these offers from our partners. Holding a cash cushion is always a smart move\u2014but in today\u2019s climate of economic uncertainty driven by President Donald Trump\u2019sshifting tariff policies, keeping money in reserve feels even more critical. Whether you\u2019re setting aside savings at a bank or moving funds out of more volatile investments, it pays to consider how much your cash could be earning. Different strategies offer different yields\u2014and the right approach can make a meaningful difference. Fortunately for savers, today\u2019s options remain highly attractive, with returns still buoyed by theFederal Reserve'selevated benchmark interest rate. And that favorable environment could persist for a few more months. According to theCME Group's FedWatch Tool, there\u2019s a better than 70% probability that the first rate cut won\u2019t come until the Fed\u2019s Sept. 17 announcement. That would be good news for savers, since the rates offered by banks, credit unions, and brokerages are closely tied to thefederal funds rate. Anytime the Fed cuts that benchmark rate, yields for savings, money market, and CD accounts fall as well. For an attractive interest rate that involves virtually no risk, the options for safe cash investment come in three main flavors: You can choose just one of these or mix and match products for different buckets of funds and timelines. In any case, you'll want to understand what each product pays. Below, we lay out today's top rates in every category as of Friday's market close, and indicate the change from a week prior. The rates below are the top nationally availableannual percentage yields (APYs)from federally insured banks and credit unions, based on our daily rate research of more than 200 institutions that offer nationwide products. Note thatsavings and money market account rates are variable, meaning the bank is free to lower them at any time. In contrast, CD rates are locked and guaranteed for the certificate's full term. The yield on money market funds fluctuates daily, while rates on cash management accounts are more fixed but can be adjusted at any time. Treasury securities pay their ratethrough maturityand can be bought directly from TreasuryDirect or bought and sold on the secondary market via a bank or brokerage. I bonds must bebought from TreasuryDirectand can be held for up to 30 years, with rates adjusted every six months. Here's a different look at all of the cash vehicles above, sorted by rate. Note that the rates shown are the highest qualifying rate for each product type. Savings Accounts The most basic place to stash cash is a bank or credit union savings account\u2014sometimes called ahigh-yield savings account\u2014that lets you add and withdraw money as you please. But don't assume your primary bank pays a competitive rate. Some banks pay virtually zero interest. Fortunately, we make shopping for a high rate easy. Our daily ranking of the best high-yield savings accounts gives you 15 options thatpay 4.31% to 5.00% APY. Note, however, that savings account rates can change at any time. Money Market Accounts Amoney market accountis a savings account that lets you write paper checks. If this is a useful feature to you, shop our list of the best money market accounts. If you don't need paper check-writing, choose whichever account type\u2014money market or savings\u2014pays the better rate. Thetop money market account rateis currently 4.37%. Again, be aware that money market rates are variable, so they can be lowered without warning. Certificates of Deposit Acertificate of deposit (CD)is a bank or credit union product with a fixed interest rate that promises a guaranteed return for a set period of time. Generally ranging from 3 months to 5 years, CDs offer a predictable return with a rate that cannot be changed for the duration of the term. But be aware that it's a commitment with teeth: If you cash in before maturity, your earnings will be dinged with an early withdrawal penalty. Our daily ranking of the best nationwide CDs currently includes 16 optionspaying at least 4.50%\u2014with a top rate of 4.60% APY. Money Market Funds Unlike a money market account at a bank,money marketfundsare mutual funds invested in cash and offered by brokerage and robo-advisor firms. Their yields can fluctuate daily but currently range from 3.92% to 4.20% at the three biggest brokerages. Cash Management Accounts For uninvested cash held at abrokerageorrobo-advisor, you can have the funds \"swept\" into a cash management account where they will earn a return. Unlike money market funds, cash management accounts offer a specific interest rate that the brokerage or robo-advisor can adjust whenever it likes. Currently, several popular brokers are paying 3.83% to 4.00% APY on their cash accounts. Treasury Bills, Notes, and Bonds TheU.S. Treasuryoffers a wide array of short- and long-term bond instruments. Treasury bills have the shortest duration, ranging from 4 to 52 weeks, while Treasury notes have a maturity of 2 to 5 years. The longest-term option is a Treasury bond, which has a 20- or 30-year maturity. Today's rates on the various Treasury products range from 3.90% to 4.93%. You canbuy T-bills, notes, and bondsstraight fromTreasuryDirector buy and sell them on the secondary market at brokerages and banks.Selling a Treasury product allows you to exit before the bond matures. However, you may pay a fee or commission for secondary market purchases and sales, while buying and redeeming at TreasuryDirect\u2014the U.S. Treasury\u2019s online platform for buying federal government securities\u2014has no fees. You can also buyTreasury ETFs, which trade on the market like a stock. Treasury ETFs have advantages and limitations, which youcan read about here. I Bonds U.S. TreasuryI bondshave a rate that's adjusted every six months to align with inflation trends.You can redeem an I bond anytime after one year or hold it for as long as 30 years. While you own the bond, your rate will change every six months. I bond rates just went up on May 1, from 3.11% for bonds issued during the previous six months to 3.98% for new bonds purchased between May 1 and Oct. 31, 2025.

        "content": "Nvidia(NVDA-2.20%)continues to dominate the lion's share of the chips going into data centers for artificial intelligence (AI). The company just reported another monster quarter of growth, and the stock is closing in on new all-time highs. There's still a case for buying Nvidia stock, but investors shouldn't put all their chips in one basket (no pun intended). Nvidia is not capturing all the demand for AI semiconductors. Hyperscalers likeAlphabet's Google andAmazonare designing custom chips for specific AI workloads in their cloud services, and this is creating tremendous growth for other leading semiconductor companies. Shares ofBroadcom(AVGO-2.90%)andTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(TSM-2.04%)recently were up 73% and 29%, respectively -- both outperforming Nvidia's 18% return over the last year. These chip stocks can broaden your exposure to the growing demand for AI chips across the data center market. Image source: Getty Images. Broadcom is a top supplier of custom AI accelerators (XPUs) and networking solutions for data centers and other markets. Its networking business supplies components that help move data at high speeds, which is vital as hyperscalers shift to more advancedAI workloads. Broadcom has reported five consecutive quarters of 20% or more revenue growth. Specifically, AI-related revenue jumped 46% year over year in the most recent quarter. Broadcom is turning this growth into strong profits, withfree cash flowreaching $6.4 billion last quarter, representing a high 43% margin on revenue. AI networking revenue, including Broadcom's Ethernet networking products, grew 170% year over year, representing nearly half of its total revenue from AI. This incredible growth in networking signals a massive ramp in computing power to create the next wave of AI applications and services. Broadcomis also supplying XPUs, which are more cost-efficient for specific workloads than Nvidia's general-purpose chips. Broadcom sees at least three customers deploying 1 million custom AI-accelerated clusters by 2027, and it reported on the last earnings call that these large hyperscalers are \"unwavering\" in their plans to continue investing in the near term. The long-term outlook for custom chip demand should support shareholder returns over the next several years. In fact, management expects custom XPU demand to accelerate through 2026. The stock isn't cheap, trading at aforward price-to-earningsmultiple of 38, but the opportunity could justify the premium. Image source: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (also known as TSMC) plays a vital role in the global supply chain for the chip industry. It's the largest chip foundry, with more than 65% market share, according to Counterpoint. It makes chips for several companies, including Nvidia, Broadcom,Advanced Micro Devices, andApple, as well as hyperscalers. The stock is surging to new highs following a monster quarter, during which revenue in U.S. dollars grew 35% year over year. This strong growth was despite weak smartphone revenue in the quarter, representing over a quarter of the company's revenue, due to seasonal demand trends. TSMC has spent decades investing in cutting-edge chip-making technology to meet customer needs for the world's most advanced chips. Its competitive advantage is based on superior manufacturing capabilities and massive chip-making capacity, enabling it to make more than 16 million 12-inch equivalent wafers annually. These advantages enabled TSMC to earn a sky-highprofit marginof 41% on a trailing-12-month basis. TSMC is planning to double its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate (CoWoS) capacity in 2025, indicating growing support for the demand that Nvidia and other customers are experiencing. TSMC recently announced a substantial investment of $165 billion to launch new manufacturing facilities in the U.S., in addition to expansion plans in other geographies. AI accelerator revenue tripled in 2024, and management expects it to double in 2025. Through 2029, the company expects demand for AI chips to grow at an annualized rate topping 40%. Taiwan Semiconductorshares may be the best value amongchip stocksright now. The stock trades at just 23 times 2025 earnings estimates, despite analysts expecting 21% annualized earnings growth. While earnings multiples above 20 are historically expensive for chip stocks, these companies are experiencing a once-in-a-generation growth spurt that will likely deliver excellent returns to investors through the end of the decade.",

        "content": "Computerized voice control expertSoundHound AI(SOUN-3.91%)has been on a wild ride over the last couple of years. Is it stillbehaving like a meme stock, or is it time to start buying this promising artificial intelligence (AI) developer yet? This company has been around for decades. The SoundHound app started collecting audio data for AI analysis in 2006 under the name Midomi. The song-recognition engine evolved into a powerful voice recognition system over time, adding language analytics to create a generally useful \"speech-to-meaning\" tool. After adding a couple of global car companies to its client list, SoundHound broadened its horizons. The company changed its name to SoundHound AI and went public in the spring of 2022, by way of aspecial purpose acquisition company(SPAC) merger. The move added $90.7 million to SoundHound AI's balance sheet, preparing the company for a more intense customer search. The generative AI boom started seven months later. OpenAI released ChatGPT 3.5 in late November 2022, kick-starting a game-changing economic boom. SoundHound AI was too small and obscure to take advantage of this sector-boosting catalyst, and the stock gained 42% over the following year. By contrast, leading AI hardware providerNvidia(NVDA-2.20%)saw share prices soar 194% in the same period. But that mellow mood was about to change. In early 2024, Nvidia disclosed a small investment in SoundHound AI stock. The stock skyrocketed on the news. SoundHound AI's stock price quadrupled in four short weeks as investors expected Nvidia to either buy the company or announce a deep, lucrative partnership. The bullish projections never came true, and SoundHound AI's stock chart pointed downward again. But the seed had been sown for an even quicker price spike. SoundHound AI was now popular enough to gain traction on social media channels with market-moving powers. One such group hoped to createa money-making short squeeze, forcing bearish investors to cover their short positions on the stock. The effort lifted share prices from less than $5 to more than $24 per share, peaking near the holidays. It's unclear whether any of the short-squeeze investors made real money this way, because the amount of short-selling only showed a temporary dip. The short interest returned to all-time highs in March and has stayed high ever since. The meme-stock surge SoundHound AI experienced last fall may be over, but the ingredients for another artificial push are still in play. The short-sale interest stands at 32%, making it one of the most shorted stocks on the market today. The stock price has doubled in 52 weeks, but it's also down 62% from the peak of late December 2024. I havesaidthat SoundHound AI could be a buy again if the share price ever drops to roughly $6. That would be roughly 40% below its price on June 12. To be fair, SoundHound AI's \"buy\" button could also earn my clicks by showing significantly stronger business results. There is some progress to report there. Trailing sales are up to $102 million nowadays, compared to $51 million a year ago. However, the company posted negativefree cash flowsof $107 million over the last four quarters -- much worse than the $76 million cash burn seen in the same year-ago period. Image source: Getty Images. There is more nuance to the story, of course. SoundHound AI keeps growing its customer list and signing more multiyear contracts. A beefy backlog of unfilled orders should convert into robust revenue growth over the next five years and maybe more. Recent additions include global banks, large healthcare systems, American fitness chains, and Japanese information security experts. It's an exciting growth story, even if most of the money-making results aren't showing up infinancial statementsyet. So the $6 share price target may be too strict, but the current price of nearly $10 per share is still a bit much. I'll hold on to some spare cash, just in case SoundHound AI posts a sharp price correction in 2025 -- or maybe the second-quarter report in August will give me enough financial substance to motivate a higher stock price. For now, I'm happy to just hold on to the SoundHound AI shares I already own.",

        "header": "3 No-Brainer AI Stocks to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "Theartificial intelligence(AI) revolution has created unprecedented opportunities for investors, but finding the right stocks requires looking beyond the hype. While hundreds of companies claim AI expertise, only a handful possess the technology, scale, and customer relationships to dominate this transformative market. Three companies stand out as no-brainer investments for those seeking exposure to AI's massive growth potential:Nvidia(NVDA-2.20%),CoreWeave(CRWV-1.36%), andSymbotic(SYM-0.07%). Read on to find out more about these incredibleAI stocks. Image source: Getty Images. Even with billions in lost revenue due to China export restrictions, Nvidia continues to prove why it's the bedrock of any serious AI investment strategy. In its latest quarter, the company delivered 69% year-over-year revenue growth to $44.1 billion despite absorbing a $4.5 billion inventory write-down tied to China-specific chips. The core reason? Nvidia's unmatched technological edge. Its new Blackwell chips are more than twice as fast as the previous generation, with 2,496 units completing advanced AI training in just 27 minutes. This leap in performance is perfectly timed as the industry pivots from training to inference -- the phase where AI systems process real-time queries and Nvidia's architecture remains dominant. CEO Jensen Huang recently committed up to $500 billion toward U.S. AI infrastructure over the next four years through domestic manufacturing partnerships. Meanwhile, data center revenue surged 73% to $39 billion last quarter, further extending Nvidia's lead over rivals likeBroadcomandAdvanced Micro Devices. Despite its scale, Nvidia trades at just 33 times forward earnings -- a compelling multiple given its explosive growth and irreplaceable position at the heart of the AI revolution. While Nvidia builds the chips, CoreWeave provides the cloud infrastructure that makes AI accessible to companies worldwide. Since its March 2025 initial public offering (IPO) at $40, shares have rocketed to around $147 as of June 13, 2025 -- a 269% return that reflects the market's hunger for pure play AI infrastructure exposure. CoreWeave's competitive advantage stems from its prescient bet on GPU-based cloud computing. The company operates 32 data centers housing over 250,000 Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs), making it one of the largest specialized AI cloud providers globally. This early positioning has attracted the industry's biggest players:Microsoftgenerates 62% of CoreWeave's revenue, whileMetaand OpenAI rely on the company for critical computing power. The financial results validate this strategic positioning. First-quarter 2025 revenue exploded 420% year over year to $982 million, with full-year guidance calling for $4.9 to $5.1 billion. More impressive still, CoreWeave sits on a $25.9 billion revenue backlog -- including an $11.9 billion OpenAI deal -- providing exceptional visibility into future growth. Yes, the company remains unprofitable as it races to build data centers fast enough to meet demand. But 74% gross margins demonstrate the pricing power that comes from controlling scarce GPU resources when everyone needs them. For investors willing to stomach the volatility, CoreWeave offers unmatched exposure to the picks-and-shovels opportunity of the AI gold rush. While most AI investments focus on software and chips,Symbotic(SYM-0.07%)applies AI to solve real-world logistics challenges. The company's warehouse automation systems use AI-powered robots to revolutionize how goods move through supply chains, addressing a market projected to reach $35 billion by 2030. Symbotic's Q2 2025 results showcased accelerating momentum, with revenue hitting $550 million -- up 40% year over year. More importantly, the company has transitioned to positive adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of $35 million while maintaining a massive $22.4 billion contracted backlog. This visibility into future revenue sets Symbotic apart from more speculative AI plays. The ultimate validation comes from who's buying.Walmart,Albertsons, and at least seven other major retailers have committed to multiyear deployments that fundamentally transform how they operate their distribution networks. These aren't cautious pilot programs -- they're complete overhauls of critical infrastructure. With 46 systems already deployed and manufacturing capacity expanding to meet surging demand, Symbotic has reached the rare point where proven technology meets a massive market opportunity.",

        "content": "Nuclear energy is experiencing its biggest revival in decades, and investors are noticing, sending shares in related stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) higher. The sector is poised to generate arecord level of electricityin 2025, while global investment in nuclear power has increased rapidly over the past four years, with a compound annual growth rate of 14%. That's up from 1% prior to 2020. The surge is less about meeting climate goals with low-carbon energy sources than about themassive power demands of AIand data centers as the global economy undergoes seismic shifts. The nuclear renaissance isn't happening in a vacuum. Data centers consumed about 4.4% of total U.S. electricity in 2023, a figure that's expected to grow to about 12% by 2028.That expected increase is driven by the growth in AI, which requires enormous amounts of reliable, 24/7 power. Major tech companies are responding by signingnuclear power purchase agreements. Meta Platforms, Inc.'s (META) recent deal with Constellation Energy for an Illinois nuclear plant follows similar moves by Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL), and Microsoft Corporation (MSFT). (For price and fundamentals on any shares listed on this page, click on their market page.) These aren't feel-good sustainability gestures, but strategic moves in the AI race. \"Securingclean, reliable energyis necessary to continue advancing our AI ambitions,\u201d said Urvi Parekh, head of global energy at Meta, in a press release. The policy environment has shifted dramatically in favor of more nuclear energy. President Trump has signed executive orders to support the industry, including moreuranium production and enrichmentin the U.S. Cameco: The world's second-largest uranium producer offers the most direct exposure to gains from nuclear fuel supplies. In May 2025, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) rated Cameco as a \"buy\" with a price target of $65, suggesting an 11% upside.Beyond uranium mining, the company owns a 49% stake in Westinghouse, giving investors exposure to reactor construction as well. Constellation Energy: Thelargest owner of nuclear plantsin the U.S. that are not rate-regulated. Unlike rate-regulated utilities, where state regulators control profits, Constellation can benefit more responsively from rising electricity prices and growing demand. GE Vernova (GEV): As a spinoff from General Electric's energy business, Vernova offers exposure to multiple energy technologies. Nuclear ETFs provide more diversification than single stocks: Global X Uranium ETF (URA): With 51 holdings and $3.6 billion in assets under management, it provides ample exposure to uranium producers, nuclear component manufacturers, and service providers. Cameco is the fund's largest position, accounting for about a quarter of its holdings. Sprott Uranium Miners ETF (URNM): Focuses specifically on uranium mining companies, with 38 holdings and $1.7 billion in net assets. This fund targets companies dedicating at least 50% of their assets to uranium mining. Perhaps the biggest gains are to be found in small modular reactors (SMRs). Over 80 SMR designs are in development, with key competitors including NuScale, Rolls-Royce Holdings PLC (RYCEY), and Rosatom, the Russian state nuclear energy company that controls over 40% of the global uranium market and 17% of international reactor fuel.These smaller,factory-built reactorspromise faster deployment and lower costs than traditional large nuclear plants. Nuclear investing isn't without significant risks: Nuclear energy investingprovides exposure to a sector seeing vast changes resulting from theincreasing energy demands for AI, evolving climate policies, and technological shifts. While traditional utilities like Constellation Energy provide stable exposure to existing nuclear assets, uranium miners like Cameco offer commodity-linked returns, and SMR developers like NuScale and Oklo are the go-to options for those seeking a higher risk-reward ratio.",

        "header": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" Are Still Growing Faster Than the Rest of the S&P 500. Here's When That Could Change, According to Wall Street Analysts.",
        "content": "TheS&P 500(^GSPC-1.13%)has produced phenomenal returns over the last two and a half years since the bottom of the 2022 bear market. The index is up nearly 70% since Oct. 2022, but much of that gain has been driven by just a handful of stocks. The\"Magnificent Seven\"have, for the most part, outperformed the benchmark over that period, and there's a clear reason why. As a group, the Magnificent Seven have produced much better earnings growth than the rest of the S&P 500. Not only that, they've consistently beaten high earnings expectations. That trend continued in the first quarter, but analysts are starting to think their phenomenal run of outperforming everything else in the market may come to an end soon. Here's what investors need to know. Image source: Nvidia. AfterNvidia(NVDA-2.20%)released its quarterly earnings on May 28, FactSet reported the Magnificent Seven grew earnings 27.7% in aggregate. That massively outperformed analysts' expectations of 16.0% earnings growth for the group. Here's how it breaks down: Six out of the seven outperformed expectations, and five of them grew earnings faster than the other 493 companies in the S&P 500 (9.4%). But as you can see, the level of outperformance and year-over-year growth varies widely from company to company. The weakest showing was most obviously from Tesla, which has suffered from political backlash against CEO Elon Musk, combined with rising competition from Chinese automakerBYD. As a result, deliveries dropped 13% year over year in the first quarter while average selling price also declined. The company's ramp-up in AI spending to support its forthcoming autonomous vehicle efforts also weighed on earnings results. On the other side of the spectrum, Amazon and Alphabet exhibited impressive earnings growth on the back of theircloud-computingbusinesses. Amazon Web Services grew sales 17% year over year, while its margin expanded to 39.5% (up from 37.6% a year ago). Google Cloud grew sales 28% with its operating margin expanding to 17.8% from 9.4% a year ago. The high-margin Google advertising business continued to produce strong growth as well. Nvidia felt the pain of restrictions on sales of its GPUs to China, but the company still managed to produce very strong earnings growth last quarter. Without the impact of the write-off in excess inventory and purchase obligations of its H20 GPUs designed for China and the related tax impact, earnings growth would have been 57% . Though Tesla is the only one showing weakness at the moment,\u00a0the rest of the group's outperformance isn't going to last forever. While analysts expect the group to continue beating the rest of the market in terms of earnings growth through the end of 2025, difficult comparisons and better performance among the rest of the stocks in the S&P 500 could present a challenge for 2026. As such, analysts currently forecast first-quarter 2026 earnings growth of 10.2% for the Magnificent Seven as a group, but the rest of the 493 companies will generate an average of 10.3% earnings growth. That forecast has some important implications for investors, even if it ultimately proves inaccurate (as is almost always the case for forecasts a year out). The first is investors will need to be more discriminating among the seven stocks going forward. We've already seen Tesla stock falter, and Apple, despite beating expectations, has seen its stock hit hard by tariff pressure. Even if investors expect strong results from one of the businesses going forward, valuation will matter more as earnings growth slows down. Alphabet is currently the only member of the group with a forward price-to-earnings ratio below 25 (it sportsan extremely attractive 18.5x multiple). The second is that there may be a lot more growth opportunities among the smaller members of the S&P 500. While analysts expect growth for the group to continue trailing the Magnificent Seven through the end of the year, that won't be true of every company. It's possible to find those companies trading at a fair value despite strong growth prospects outside of the Magnificent Seven. Another option is to buy an equal-weight S&P 500 index fund like theInvescoS&P 500 Equal Weight ETF(RSP-1.21%). The fund invests evenly across all 500 constituents of the S&P 500, rebalancing on a quarterly basis. That ensures you capture just as much upside from smaller businesses as you do from the biggest companies in the index. As the tide turns andwe start to see more parity in the market, investors should expect a stronger showing over the next year (or longer) from smaller names in the stock market. Meanwhile, many of the Magnificent Seven are starting to look expensive relative to their future earnings growth prospects as analysts' expectations come down. It may be worth selling off some to invest in new opportunities.",

        "content": "With the first half of 2025 nearly over, many investors are taking time to reevaluate their portfolios and take advantage of quality stocks that can be bought at a discount. It certainly requires some confidence to buy shares of a company when they're down, but it's opportunities like these that offer the potential for outsize returns. Two Fool.com contributors, for example, recognize that oil supermajorChevron(CVX0.53%)and data center equipment providerVertiv(VRT-3.23%)are two worthy considerations for investors to click the buy buttons on right now since they're stocks are trading down 23% and 26%, respectively, from recent all-time highs. Image source: Getty Images. Scott Levine(Chevron):While the 23% decline inChevron stockfrom its all-time high in January 2023 may be disconcerting, the truth is that the stock's fall isn't wholly unexpected. There's a strong correlation between the movements of energy prices and those of energy stocks, so when investors pair Chevron stock's plunge with the 22% dip in the price of oil benchmark West Texas Intermediate during the same time period, the performance in Chevron's stock becomes much more understandable. Whether you're on the prowl for a reliable dividend stock or a steady energy stock or something in between, Chevron fits the bill. For 38 consecutive years, the company has hiked its dividend -- a notable achievement for any company but especially one whose business revolves aroundcommoditiesalong with their cyclical prices. Lest investors fear that the company is sacrificing its financial health to placate shareholders, a peek at Chevron's average payout ratio over the past five years should allay their concerns: It's a conservative 68.4%. Unlike some companies that solely focus on exploration and production, or those with midstream businesses, or downstream operations, Chevron operates throughout the energy value chain. This provides it with the ability to benefit from greater efficiencies than companies with more concentrated operations, as well as mitigating the risks associated with a slowing in the business of any one link in the energy value chain. For those looking to put some pep in their passive income streams, now seems like a great time to gas up on Chevron stock. LeeSamaha(Vertiv):Data center equipment provider andNvidiapartnerVertiv's stock trades down about 26% from its all-time high. It has recovered significantly recently, but despite a strong run, it's still an overall dip worth buying into. That reasoning relies on assuming that we are in the early innings of investment inartificial intelligence(AI) applications and the data centers necessary to support AI growth. As recently discussed, there areno signs of a slowdown in data center spending, and that bodes well for the near-term outlook. Thinking more medium-term, Vertiv's data center power systems are set to play a key role in the new generation of data centers that Nvidia is building toward. Nvidia believes the new 800-volt (V) high voltage direct current (HVDC) data centers (set to be launched in 2027) can improve efficiency by 5%, reduce copper usage, and lower maintenance costs by 70%, and also lower cooling costs. The good news is that Vertiv plans to have its 800-V HVDC power systems ready by the second half of 2026, in time for deployment with Nvidia's key platform rollouts in 2027. That should drive the next cycle of orders at Vertiv, and as long as AI demand continues to explode, it's likely that Vertiv's total addressable market for its power systems, thermal management, and data center infrastructure will also grow strongly. While semiconductor stocks often get the lion's share of attention regarding AI, Vertiv is a great consideration for investors looking to gain AI exposure -- especially with 2026 shaping up to an auspicious year of developments for the company. On the other hand, income investors who have the patience to wait out a downturn in energy prices have a great opportunity to power up their passive income streams right now with Chevron stock.",

        "content": "Oracle (ORCL) has justwrapped up its quarterly reporting period with impressive results. Revenue rose 11% year-over-year to $15.9 billion, beating expectations with ease. Non-GAAP earnings per share came in at $1.70, topping the consensus estimate of around $1.65. In my view, Oracle\u2019s bold investments in Cloud services\u2014particularly Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)\u2014are clearly bearing fruit. I\u2019m bullish on the stock, as Oracle continues to demonstrate resilience and leadership in both Cloud and AI. Easily unpack a company's performancewith TipRanks' new KPI Datafor smart investment decisions Receive undervalued, market resilient stocks right to your inboxwith TipRanks' Smart Value Newsletter Oracle\u2019s Cloud segments were the clear standouts in Q4. Total Cloud revenue\u2014which includes both Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS)\u2014jumped 27% year-over-year to roughly $6.7 billion. The real highlight was Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), which surged 52% to reach $3 billion, underscoring Oracle\u2019s aggressive push to capture AI-heavy workloads in the Cloud Infrastructure space. A key driver behind Oracle\u2019s Cloud momentum is its smartly executed multi-cloud strategy. On the earnings call, Larry Ellison revealed that Oracle\u2019s MultiCloud database services\u2014used by customers on Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft Azure (MSFT), and Google Cloud (GOOGL)\u2014soared 115% quarter-over-quarter. This approach is savvy, as it turns would-be rivals into collaborators. With enterprise demand rising for hybrid and multi-cloud solutions, Oracle is carving out a distinct competitive edge among the major cloud providers. One of the key reasons I\u2019m bullish on Oracle\u2019s long-term growth is its record-high backlog of contracts, formally known as Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO). This quarter, RPO surged 41% year-over-year to an all-time high of $138 billion. That\u2019s a strong signal of sustained demand, providing a significant level of revenue visibility and stability for shareholders over the coming years. Management attributed much of this backlog growth to major contracts with companies like OpenAI, Meta (META), Nvidia (NVDA), and AMD (AMD). CEO Safra Catz expressed evident enthusiasm, projecting that Oracle\u2019s Cloud business will grow by more than 40% in Fiscal 2026, with OCI continuing to expand at a rate above 70%. Oracle deserves real credit here\u2014its momentum is undeniable, and Larry Ellison remains the quintessential relentless tech visionary, pushing the company to the forefront of the Cloud andAIrevolution. Scaling Oracle\u2019s Cloud business comes with a hefty price tag. In FY2025, the company invested roughly $21.2 billion in capital expenditures, reflecting its aggressive buildout of GPU clusters and data centers. While these substantial investments did put some pressure on margins\u2014non-GAAP operating margin dipped slightly to about 44%, down from 47% last year\u2014I view this as a reasonable and strategically sound tradeoff. Crucially, Oracle remains solidly profitable and financially strong. Operating cash flow for the year reached an impressive $20.8 billion, providing the company with ample capacity to reinvest in future growth. Management made it clear on the earnings call that these upfront investments are designed to drive high-margin, recurring revenue over time, essentially laying the groundwork for long-term profitability. With around $18 billion in cash and short-term investments, Oracle appears to have the financial flexibility to fund its expansion without overburdening its balance sheet. While I\u2019m optimistic about Oracle\u2019s growth potential, it\u2019s essential to acknowledge the risks. Management\u2019s aggressive expansion strategy hinges on flawless execution and sustained demand. If enterprise IT spending slows, if overall demand for public Cloud services weakens, or if customers shift more quickly toward AWS or Azure, Oracle\u2019s growth trajectory could face headwinds. Additionally, Oracle is making significant capital investments while also aiming to deliver strong returns to shareholders. This high-stakes approach means that any misstep or shortfall in demand could result in the company having costly, underutilized infrastructure. However, given Oracle\u2019s recent track record, management\u2019s demonstrated competence, and the sheer scale of its secured backlog, I believe these risks are manageable and well within the company\u2019s capacity to navigate. On Wall Street, Oracle has a consensusModerate Buyrating based on 15 Buys, 12 Holds, and zero Sells.The average ORCL price target of $192.91 indicates a 3.5% downside potentialover the next 12 months. This means that, despite the company\u2019s current operational and financial strengths, the market has likely priced Oracle stock too high in the short term. It\u2019s probably best to wait for a pullback before buying shares. Oracle\u2019s quarterly results strengthen my confidence in the sustained upward trajectory of Oracle\u2019s operating model. What was once a bold and uncertain Cloud transformation is now clearly delivering results. Oracle\u2019s heavy investment in OCI, its strategic focus on multi-cloud architecture and partnerships, and its sizable backlog of signed contracts all point to long-term, market-leading growth that appears both durable and well-earned.

        "content": "Nvidia(NVDA-2.20%)has been one of the stock market's biggest movers and shakers in recent times. This is because the company plays a key role in a technology that has garnered everyone's attention: artificial intelligence (AI). Nvidia's chips power the training of models that set AI into action, and AI could change the world in much the same way the internet did several years ago. That's why investors have piled into Nvidia stock and have closely tuned in to anything the company's chief executive officer Jensen Huang has said. These comments offer us some visibility on what's ahead for the company -- and even the entire industry. So, it's not surprising that, often, after an Nvidia event, the stock will react. As we look at the calendar, it tells us that one such event is right around the corner. On June 25, Nvidia holds its annual meeting of stockholders. Should you buy the stock before then? History has something to say -- and it may surprise you. Image source: Getty Images. Before we get started, let's talk about Nvidia's most recent big moment, and that was the company's first-quarter earnings report on May 28. Nvidia wowed investors once again, as revenue soared 69% to more than $44 billion, surpassing analysts' estimates -- and importantly, the company spoke of ongoing strong demand for its new Blackwell architecture. The platform was designed specifically with inferencing in mind, a smart move considering that is the area of focus for many AI customers.Inferencingis the \"thinking\" process that results in AI coming up with answers to complex questions, and this requires significant power. \"We'reoff to the races,\" Huang said during the earnings call, signaling much more growth lies ahead. Nvidia stock climbed in the post-earnings trading session, and though it fluctuated on certain trading days, it delivered a gain of about 6% in the two weeks following the report. Now, let's consider the upcoming shareholders' meeting. The company recently released the agenda, which includes items of business such as the election of directors nominated by the board of directors, advisory approval of executive compensation, and several other matters. These don't stand out as elements that will push the stock higher or lower, though any comments from Huang about the company's prospects could act as a catalyst. What does history show us about Nvidia's stock performance after a shareholders' meeting? As the chart shows, the stock fell in the days following last year's meeting, then went on to rebound in the weeks to follow.  NVDAdata byYCharts Nvidia followed a similar pattern in 2023. And in 2022, the stock also fell following the meeting, but didn't go on to recover so quickly -- in fact, Nvidia delivered a double-digit loss from that point through the end of the year. So it might seem surprising that, in spite of Nvidia's earnings and general message being positive over the past few years, the stock actually fell after each shareholder meeting. It's important to keep in mind, though, that this likely isn't a result of anything said or decided at the annual event. At this point in Nvidia's growth story, investors react to new or extremely strong messages from Huang -- but they may not reward the stock with gains after a \"routine\" sort of event such as a shareholder meeting. Now let's get back to our question: Should you buy Nvidia before June 25? History tells us there's no need to rush into the stock on anticipation of phenomenal gains following the shareholder meeting. But this doesn't mean Nvidia isn't a buy. The company has built a market-leading position and should maintain this thanks to its commitment to innovation. That makesNvidia stocka fantastic addition to any AI portfolio, but you don't have to rush into it -- whether you buy Nvidia now or after the meeting, you have a great chance of winning over the long haul.",

        "header": "The Best Stocks to Buy With $1,000 Right Now",
        "content": "Even though the market recovered substantially from its lows during April, plenty of stocks are still at appealing valuations right now. The economy hasn't been impacted by tariffs so far, and demand for AI-related products hasn't slowed a bit. If you've got $1,000 to deploy, I think you will be incredibly happy with the price you've bought these stocks at three to five years down the road. Nvidia(NVDA1.00%),Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(TSM0.99%), andAlphabet(GOOG0.43%)(GOOGL-0.66%)are at the top of my shopping list right now. Each of these investments brings something different to the table and creates a balanced approach to AI. Image source: Getty Images. Of these three, Nvidia represents the growth option. Nvidia'sgraphics processing units (GPUs)are the go-to computing device for nearly every AI hyperscaler. As a result, Nvidia's revenue boomed over the past few years and is still rapidly growing. In Q1 FY 2026 (ending April 28), its revenue rose 69% year over year to $44 billion, and revenue is projected to rise to $45 billion in Q2, indicating 50% growth. Although that's impressive, growth could be further bolstered by a trade deal with China that allows Nvidia to sell its chips there again or a significant AI buildout in Europe, which appears to be gaining steam recently. The stock isn't cheap at 33 times forward earnings, but that's the price you must pay to own a stock posting market-leading growth. We've only scratched the surface of the computing power necessary to run an economy assisted by AI, which will boost Nvidia's growth over the long run. There's still plenty of growth ahead for Nvidia, and the demand signals it's sending to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing back that up. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) is a critical supplier to Nvidia, as Nvidia doesn't have the facilities to manufacture its own chips. So it outsources that work to a chip foundry like TSMC -- the world's top semiconductor foundry, boasting cutting-edge technology and best-in-class execution. Nearly all of the big tech companies are customers of TSMC in one way or another, and its neutral position in the chip world gives it a great view into the future, as chip orders are often placed years in advance. This allows TSMC's management to make accurately forecast its revenue. The most recent estimate the company gave investors when laying out guidance for 2025 was that its expects its AI-related to revenue to grow at a 45% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next five years, which will help bolster overall revenue growth of a 20% CAGR over that same time frame. That's monster growth, although it will likely be slower than Nvidia's growth because TSMC also has a significant chunk of its business tied up in areas outside AI. TSMC's stock trades for a reasonable22.5 times forward earnings,making it a balanced choice between growth and valuation. Alphabet isn't considered a growth company, although maybe it should be if you're only looking at profit growth. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, is invested in AI so that its advertising business can continue to maintain its dominance. There is a deep fear in the market that traditional search could be replaced by individuals only using generative AI to perform searches, but Google already bridged that gap by offering AI search overviews at the top of its Google search. This hybrid approach could be a winning development, leaving Google at the top of this critical space. However, the market doesn't buy this argument and has given Alphabet a steep discount to other big tech stocks.  GOOGL PE Ratio (Forward)data byYCharts At 18.3 times forward earnings, Alphabet is far cheaper than the broader market, as measured by theS&P 500. The S&P 500 trades for 22.5 times forward earnings, so this deep discount makes Alphabet a value stock. However, if you look at its earnings growth, it doesn't seem like much of a value stock. In Q1, Alphabet's revenue rose 12% year over year, and its diluted earnings per share increased 49% year over year. That's growth stock performance from a value company, making Alphabeta clear no-brainer buy,especially if it can navigate the huge transition going on between AI and search.",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Big Tech has led the furious rebound in US stocks from the tailspin that followed President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping April 2 tariff edict. Now options traders are signaling that they see the pricey cohort as especially vulnerable to another round of trade war-driven volatility. Most Read from Bloomberg Shuttered NY College Has Alumni Fighting Over Its Future Do World\u2019s Fairs Still Matter? As Part of a $45 Billion Push, ICE Prepares for a Vast Expansion of Detention Space As American Architects Gather in Boston, Retrofits Are All the Rage The cost of protecting against a correction in the Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 exchange-traded fund, which tracks the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index, is climbing with less than a month to go until Trump\u2019s 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs potentially ends. On Friday, the relative price of hedging against a 10% decline in the ETF, compared with a similar rally, hit its highest level since early April. The growing skepticism toward the megacap rally shows investors are well aware of the risks, should trade tensions flare again and reignite worries around the US economic outlook. The tech behemoths fell harder than the broad market during the early April turmoil, and some investors see a threat that it could happen again. \u201cRight now, high valuations, and to some extent economic impacts of the tariffs, are still worries,\u201d Rocky Fishman, founder of research firm Asym 500, said in an interview. Helped by a positive earnings season, a Bloomberg gauge of the Magnificent Seven \u2014 Nvidia Corp., Microsoft Corp., Tesla Inc., Apple Inc., Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. \u2014 has rallied 31% since April 8, the day before Trump paused most of his harshest tariffs. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 Index is up 20%. Besides trade-war fears, there are other reasons for concern about the group, such as the amount of cash they\u2019re throwing at artificial intelligence. That spending is fueling concerns about profit margins, and investors have high expectations that those expenditures will pay off. High valuations present another worry. Bloomberg\u2019s Magnificent Seven gauge is trading at 29 times projected profits, above a 10-year average of 28. That compares with the S&P 500\u2019s forward multiple of 22. Earlier this month, Needham analysts downgraded Apple\u2019s stock to a hold rating, warning that the company\u2019s valuation looks \u201cexpensive on several metrics.\u201d They also cited the iPhone maker\u2019s vulnerability to US tariffs. The uptick in demand for hedges underscores investor doubts about the staying power of the current rally, Fishman said. \u201cWith these reluctant rallies, where people don\u2019t feel too excited and they just see the market keep on going up, then you start seeing investors getting nervous about giving up the gains they\u2019ve picked up,\u201d said Fishman.

While air safety experts have said that at this time there is no reason to think a manufacturing or design problem caused the incident, it comes as the aircraft manufacturer faces heightened scrutiny over its production processes followingseveral mishaps involving its planes, includinga door plug detaching in midairon an Alaska Airlines 737 Max 9 flight in January last year. Boeing shares fell 4.8% on Thursday and dropped another 1.7% on Friday, closing the week at around $200. The stock still trades about 13% higher since the start of the year.

Below, we take a closer look at Boeing\u2019s chart and usetechnical analysisto identify crucial price levels worth watching out for. Boeing shares staged a news-drivenbreakdownfrom arising wedge patternin Thursday's trading session, potentially setting the stage for a deeperretracement. The selling, which occurred on the highestvolumesince last October, coincided with therelative strength indexfalling toward its neutral threshold, signaling accelerating downside momentum. Amid the potential for further price swings, let\u2019s identify crucialsupport and resistancelevels on Boeing\u2019s chart that investors will likely be watching. Follow-through selling could see the shares initially test the $187 level. The shares find aconfluenceof support in this area near the upward sloping50-day moving averageand multiplepeakson the chart stretching back to May last year. This location also sits in the same neighborhood as the 38.2%Fibonacci retracement levelwhen applying a grid from the April low to June high. A close below this crucial price opens the door for a fall to lower support around $163, roughly in the same vicinity as the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level. Investors may look forbuy-and-holdopportunities in this region near ahorizontal linethat links a range of correspond trading activity over a 12-month period between April last year and April this year. Upswings in the stock could propel an initial rebound toward $218. This area on the chart may provide overhead selling pressure near the top of the rising wedge, which also closely aligns with a period ofconsolidationjust below the200-day moving averageearly last year. Finally, buying above this level could see Boeing shares climb to around $245. Investors who haveaccumulated the stockat lower prices may look tolock in profitson a fill of the prominent January 2024stock gap.

        "header": "Is This Beaten-Down Cathie Wood Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock a Buy?",
        "content": "Recursion Pharmaceuticals(RXRX0.20%)is not the most famous artificial intelligence (AI) stock on the market, but the biotech (or techbio) company has attracted the attention of some big names. Recursion has partnered with the AI juggernautNvidiato build a powerful supercomputer, for example. It is also attracting interest from some prominent Wall Street figures, including Cathie Wood, the CEO of Ark Invest. The investment firm owns about $164 million worth of the stock, as of this writing. Yet, Recursion has not been performing well -- shares are down by 19% this year. Should investors take this opportunity to buy the stock on the dip? Image source: Getty Images. People in the tech world are familiar withMoore's law, which predicts an exponential increase in computing power at a lower cost. Fewer people are familiar with Eroom's law (Moore's backward), the observation that the business of developing novel medicines has become more expensive even as technology has improved. Drugmakers spend considerable time and money to get their products to market. Most new compounds never go that far, and many that do hardly make enough money to justify the investment that went into them. Recursion is looking to solve that problem. The company has developed an AI-powered operating system (OS) that features a library of human genes. This OS is constantly testing clinical compounds against this library. The most promising ones are chosen to be tested in the clinic. The potential benefits here could be faster discovery, faster development, lower costs, longer time spent under patent exclusivity on the market, higher sales, higher profits, and higher margins. In other words, if Recursion Pharmaceuticals is successful, it could transform thepharmaceutical industry. Besides developing its own medicines, Recursion would also license out its AI-powered OS to other companies. That business might look even more attractive. It is far less cost-intensive than developing medicines (even if that becomes easier thanks to Recursion, it will still require tens of millions of dollars to undergo clinical trials), while also returning much higher margins. That's why some investors like Wood are interested in the stock. The company's upside potential is massive. And it got an even rosier outlook earlier this year when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced that it would be slowly phasing out animal testing in pre-clinical trials in favor of other methods, including AI-based models. It might look as though Recursion'a approach is the future. So why isn't the stock soaring, then? Recursion Pharmaceuticals has yet to show the kind of evidence that would convince most investors that its approach works. The company doesn't have a single product on the market. Worse, it doesn't even have a single product in phase 3 studies. In fact, the biotech recently abandoned the development of several compounds. While management said this was to focus on other, more promising candidates, that move still doesn't bode well for a company that claims to be able to transform the way medicines are developed. It's also worth noting that other companies have recognized the potential for AI to transform the industry.Novo Nordisk, through its parent company, helped build an AI supercomputer in Denmark, where it is based, because of the technology's potential across healthcare, including in drug development. Recursion hopes that its AI-based OS will become more fine-tuned thanks to future successes and even failures. In other words, data from clinical trials is important, and that's an advantage that more experienced companies, such as Novo Nordisk, will have over smaller, younger biotechs. So what should investors do? Recursion Pharmaceuticals carries above-average risk because of its status as a clinical-stagebiotech company, but it could also deliver life-changing returns if it achieves its goals. Risk-tolerant investors might consider initiating a small position in the stock, just like Wood did. The company makes up 1.65% of Ark Invest's combined portfolio, as of this writing. Those comfortable with volatility can start somewhere there (or lower). Risk-averse investors, though, should look elsewhere.",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc. keeps writing bigger checks in pursuit of its artificial intelligence strategy, and traders keep cheering it on, encouraged that the expensive bets will keep paying off. Most Read from Bloomberg Shuttered NY College Has Alumni Fighting Over Its Future Do World\u2019s Fairs Still Matter? As Part of a $45 Billion Push, ICE Prepares for a Vast Expansion of Detention Space As American Architects Gather in Boston, Retrofits Are All the Rage The stock is back near record territory after soaring more than 40% from its April low. Last week, Meta finalized a $14.3 billion investment in Scale AI, whose leader is joining a team being assembled by Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg to pursue artificial general intelligence. That came just after Meta raised its capital spending forecast for 2025 to as much as $72 billion. \u201cThe amount of spending might give some pause, but we\u2019re confident Meta can use AI to drive revenue and accelerate growth,\u201d said Jake Seltz, who manages the Allspring LT Large Growth ETF. \u201cThis shows Meta is committed to making the investments it needs to maintain its leadership, and while the stock has had a nice run, we\u2019re still bullish on the long-term opportunity.\u201d Meta\u2019s rally has coincided with a resurgence in trader appetites for AI-related stocks, after the earnings season alleviated fears that Big Tech companies might rein in spending on expensive computing gear. The rebound marks a shift from earlier in the year, when stocks such as Nvidia Corp. tumbled on concerns about AI models developed on the cheap in China. An exchange traded fund that tracks AI stocks including Amazon.com Inc. is up 32% from a low on April 8, the day before US President Donald Trump paused tariffs on trading partners, sparking a broad relief rally in stocks. Over that period, the Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF has outperformed the S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100, which have gained about 20% and 27%, respectively. Allen Bond, portfolio manager at Jensen Investment Management, bought Meta shares for the first time in recent weeks, in part because of the company\u2019s aggressive spending on AI. He also cited improved operational efficiencies and the shift away from the so-called metaverse, which prompted the company to change its name from Facebook in 2021. \u201cUsing AI to optimize the data it has on users for revenue is a clear application, one that allows Meta to play offense while Alphabet is playing defense,\u201d Bond said, referring to concerns that the Google parent could lose market share in the lucrative search business to AI services like ChatGPT. \u201cWhile AI is expensive, there is good evidence that it is really paying off so far.\u201d Meta\u2019s return on invested capital hit a record high of 31% in the first quarter, more than double the levels from 2023 when the company\u2019s metaverse ambitions were driving higher spending. Meta uses AI to improve ad targeting and increase engagement across its apps, which also include Instagram and WhatsApp. The Wall Street Journal recently reported that Meta is looking to fully automate ad creation, using AI technologies. Dan Salmon, an analyst at New Street Research, estimated that generative AI creative tools could boost Meta\u2019s annual ad revenue growth by 1% to 2% over the next several years, and as much as 4% by the end of the decade. Still, long-term tailwinds from AI are widely expected, raising the question of how much further the stock can rally in the near term. Shares trade at 24.5 times estimated earnings, cheaper than other megacaps, but still above its own average over the past decade of about 22 times. While Wall Street is broadly optimistic \u2014 nearly 90% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying \u2014 Meta shares are just shy of the average price target, suggesting limited expectations for additional gains. \u201cIt is still in the buy range, since you\u2019re getting pretty strong growth for a pretty reasonable price,\u201d said Greg Halter, director of research at the Carnegie Investment Counsel. \u201cStill, rallies like this don\u2019t continue forever, and it certainly isn\u2019t the screaming buy it was not too long ago.\u201d Top Tech Stories Taiwan has blacklisted Huawei Technologies Co. and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., dealing another major blow to the two companies spearheading China\u2019s efforts to develop cutting-edge AI chip technologies. The Washington Post is investigating a cyber attack on the email accounts of some journalists, prompting the newspaper to beef up its online security. Apple\u2019s unveiling of iOS 26 and the Liquid Glass interface was the most discussed part of its developers conference, but the real gems were its enhancements to CarPlay, the Vision Pro and the iPad.

        "content": "Chicago, IL \u2013 June 16, 2025\u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights CoreWeave CRWV, Circle Internet Group CRCL and NVIDIA NVDA. IPO activity post-pandemic has fluctuated significantly, primarily driven by economic uncertainty, rising interest rates, and inflation, all of which have impacted investor sentiment. But the tide has shifted positively over the past year, with several notable IPOs hitting the market, includingCoreWeaveandCircle Internet Group. Both stocks have seen big runs in June. In short, CRWV provides exposure to the AI frenzy, whereas CRCL is a play on the mainstreaming of digital dollars and the evolving stablecoin regulatory landscape. Let's take a closer glance at each. Given its backing by AI-favoriteNVIDIA, the IPO reflected one of the most exciting we've seen in years. An SEC filing in late May 2025 revealed NVIDIA has a $900 million stake, reflecting one of its largest investors. It's also important to know that NVIDIA supplies CoreWeave with most of its high-performance GPUs that power CRWV's AI infrastructure. Some time back, investors raised flags concerning the massive amount of sales NVIDIA generated from CRWV, but that concern has since evaporated. The company's latest set of quarterly results were driven by accelerating demand for its AI offerings, with sales up a staggering 420% year-over-year. Revenue backlog totaled a strong $25.9 billion, with CRWV also securing more lucrative deals with enterprises. Up 270% since its IPO, the stock remains a great play on the AI frenzy, which appears to still be in the early innings. Circle is a global financial technology firm that enables businesses of all sizes to harness the power of digital currencies and public blockchains for payments, commerce, and financial applications worldwide. It's the issuer of USDC, the world's second-largest dollar-pegged stablecoin, widely used across exchanges, DeFi platforms, and institutional trading venues. But what does that even mean? CEO Jeremy Allaire explains simply \u2013 'If you could take what we think of as money, make it digital and available on the internet, then that would dramatically change the way we use money and open up opportunities around the world. That's the idea behind Circle.' Since their debut on June 5th, shares have gone on a massive run. It's worth noting that Cathie Wood's ARK had a big win on the stock, purchasing roughly 4.5 million shares on its first day of trading. The stock overall reflects a great play on the evolving stablecoin regulatory landscape, which is also just seemingly beginning as we increasingly wade into the digital age. IPO news has dominated headlines this week, a nice breather from tariffs news that have consistently impacted sentiment. Circle shares have been blistering hot since their debut this month, with CoreWeave shares also seeing similar price action since its debut. The price action here post-IPO actually bodes well for the broader market overall, which reflects 'hungry' investor sentiment. Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. The move targets China's ambitions in artificial intelligence, requiring Taiwanese firms to secure special licenses before supplying cutting-edge chip tech, materials, or equipment to the two companies, or their subsidiaries worldwide, including units in Japan, Germany, and Russia. Listed under Taiwan's Strategic High-Tech Commodities Entity List, Huawei and SMIC now face added roadblocks to building competitive AI capabilities.

The timing follows fresh U.S. curbs on Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) export-friendly H20 AI chips, which are now barred from Chinese sales. That pressure may ironically play to Nvidia's advantage by sidelining key Chinese challengers. As the world's largest contract chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.

Analysts say resistance sits around $27; a familiar ceiling from late 2024. A stretch target of $37.50 is also in play; based on a measured move from the breakout. On the flip side; support holds around $15 the upper line of the old rectangle; with deeper support near $9 if sentiment sours. Beyond the charts; the fundamentals are improving too. Quantum Computing recently completed its Quantum Photonic Chip Foundry in Tempe, Arizona; and has been expanding ties with government and commercial clients; betting big on photonic and quantum optics applications.

Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with AMD. Su said the MI355 chips are 35 times faster than previous models; and beat Nvidia's B200 and GB200 in inference tasks with comparable or better performance in AI training workloads. The chips, which began shipping earlier this month, come at a significantly lower cost than Nvidia's equivalents, AMD said. While AMD still trails far behind Nvidia which generates over $100 billion annually from AI accelerators Su said the company's new lineup could reset expectations and momentum, especially in its data center segment.

        "header": "Should You Forget Palantir and Buy These 2 Tech Stocks Instead?",
        "content": "Palantir Technologies(NASDAQ: PLTR)has emerged as a leading artificial intelligence company, offering AI data analytics to the U.S. government and businesses. And the company is growing quickly, with sales rising 39% to $884 million and adjusted earnings increasing 63% to $0.13 per share in the first quarter. That second figure is especially notable because many AI start-ups aren't profitable, making Palantir an exception among many of its peers. Its success has helped propel the company's share price to dizzying heights, gaining nearly 500% over the past year. But this rapid rise means thatits stockis now extremely expensive, trading at aprice-to-earnings ratio(P/E) of 574. Paying such a high premium typically isn't a wise decision. So, here are two other AI companies that are leaders as well, at a much lower premium. Image source: Getty Images. Nvidia(NVDA1.26%)doesn't need an introduction for anyone who follows the tech sector closely, but it's worth highlighting some of the strengths of the company to show just how dominant it is in AI. Here are a few highlights: Its financial performance remains very strong, and the company has little competition in AI data center processors. While there have been some rumblings of tech companies backing away from spending in this category, a slowdown has yet to happen. Data center spending will reach $1.1 trillion in 2029, double what companies were spending last year, according to the analysis website Network World. It's worth noting thatNvidia's stockhas a P/E of 46, which means it's not necessarily cheap. Still, it's far less pricey than Palantir, and the company arguably has a much bigger competitive moat in AI than Palantir does. It's easy to overlookMicrosoft(MSFT0.66%)because it has seemingly been around forever. But while younger AI companies may attract a lot of attention, Microsoft is already benefiting from AI and continues to be a leading player in cloud computing. Its Azure cloud computing service now has a 21% market share in its market, making gains againstAmazon, which holds 30% of the market. Cloud services sales spiked 35% in its fiscal third quarter (which ended March 31), showing that the company continues to find new ways to increase demand in this area. And management wiselyinvested in OpenAIearly, giving the company access to ChatGPT when it debuted. Since then, Microsoft has integrated the chatbot into many of its services, giving it an edge over other tech giants that are still trying to catch the AI wave (I'm looking at you,Apple). That's one of the reasons why the stock has jumped 42% over the past two years, while Apple's has gained just 12%. With its early moves into AI coupled with the company's strong cloud business, Microsoft is poised to continue benefiting as artificial intelligence expands. And with the stock having a P/E of just 36, it's far less expensive than Palantir. Palantir has a good product that is profiting from AI, but I think buying the company's stock when it's so expensive could be a mistake. There are plenty of other tech companies benefiting from AI with share prices that are far less frothy, with Nvidia and Microsoft being two of the best right now.",

        "content": "You might have a retirement plan. But is it built to survive a crisis? According to Allianz, 62% of Americans worry a future national or global crisis could derail their retirement\u2014but only 46% have actually accounted for those risks in their plan. If your strategy hinges on stable markets and predictable outcomes, it may be time tostress-test your futureby ensuring you\u2019reproperly diversified, factoring risks that are often overlooked, and employing flexible tools to give you options during times of need. A crisis-proof retirement plan doesn\u2019t rely on just one investment or one income stream. Carlie Ransom, co-founder of Equal Path Investments, explains that the strongest strategies utilize three main forms ofinvestment diversification: time horizon,tax treatment, and asset class. She recommends mixing bothfixed and variable incomesources\u2014such as Social Security, annuities, rental income, dividends, andbond ladders\u2014so you can draw income from different buckets depending on market conditions. \u201cWhen a plan is properly tax-diversified, the impact of rapidly changing tax laws becomes less of an issue,\u201d Ransom adds. That might mean balancing pretax, Roth, and taxable accounts now so you aren\u2019t cornered by higher tax rates later. Your plan might already account for market volatility\u2014but that\u2019s not the only threat. \u201cI see clients consistently underestimatinghealthcare costsand long-term care needs,\u201d Ransom says. \u201cThese can easily derail even well-funded retirement plans.\u201d Someone turning 65 has an almost 70% chance of needing long-term care at some point in the future, and the costs can quickly pile up.In the United States, the average cost for a private nursing home room is about $127,750 each year.\u201cNot everyone wants to be forced into [state-assisted care],\u201d Ransom says, so building in long-term care options\u2014whether through insurance or self-funding\u2014is key. Ransom also flagslongevity riskand unexpected life transitions\u2014like losing a job in your 50s or caring for an aging parent\u2014as critical blind spots. Inflation and tax law changes are another major threat, especially for those with concentrated portfolios or fixed incomes. You can\u2019t predict the next crisis, but you can prepare for one. To build some flexibility into your plan, Ransom recommends a number of tools, such as bond ladders, which are less vulnerable to big price swings than individual long-term bonds and fixed annuities, which can help cover essential expenses. She also suggests consideringhybrid life insurancewithlong-term care ridersfor more predictable funding in the event you do need long-term care. But above all, keep your options open. \u201cI\u2019ve met both clients and advisors who believe they are anti-stock market, or anti-annuity, or anti-long-term care insurance, anti-going-back-to-work, but in reality, being diversified beyond one approach leads to the most resiliency,\u201d Ransom says. Think of yourretirement strategyas a living document\u2014not a set-it-and-forget-it plan. Annual reviews should includestress-testing different scenarios, like early retirement due to health issues, extended market downturns, or significant changes in tax policy, Ransom says. If you\u2019ve recently inherited money or are considering retiring early, take a moment to really think through your options. \u201c$750,000 or $1 million sounds like a giant number...but this amount is too small for many households,\u201d Ransom says, especially without pensions or substantial Social Security. Instead of seeing retirement as a finish line, she advises clients to explorephased retirementor part-time work that keeps them engaged and financially stable. Nearly half (47%) of Americans say they don\u2019t have awritten financial planat all, according to Allianz.That means even if you\u2019ve saved for retirement, your money might not be protected against critical risks, especially if you have any blind spots. Crisis-proofing your retirement plan isn\u2019t about doom and gloom\u2014it\u2019s about durability. Diversify your income streams, build flexibility into yourwithdrawal strategy, and don\u2019t ignore risks like taxes, inflation, or long-term care. You can\u2019t plan for every crisis, but with the right foundation, you don\u2019t necessarily need to.",

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is one of the most important companies in the world primarily due to the fact that it is responsible for manufacturing most of the world\u2019s advanced AI and personal computing chips. The firm\u2019s leading-edge chip manufacturing technologies are used by the world\u2019s leading technology companies such as Apple and NVIDIA. Crmaer\u2019s previous comments about Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) have compared the firm to NVIDIA especially since the latter relies on it for making its GPU chips.

Cramer\u2019s previous comments about Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) concerned the firm\u2019s valuation particularly due to the impact of its location in Taiwan: \u201cOkay so I\u2019m gonna give you, how to read that, you can dismiss it, but I\u2019ll give it to you. Taiwan Semi, discount versus NVIDIA is how you look at it. The Taiwan Semi, the discount, it\u2019s 17 versus 23 times earnings, that is simply the discount of, a, I don\u2019t wanna say it, takeover, because that gets people scared.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses. Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) is one of the largest networking and communications products companies in the world. In today\u2019s era of AI-driven stock market returns, the firm\u2019s shares have gained 8.4% year-to-date despite a 13% drop after the Liberation Day tariff announcement in April.

        "header": "High-Yield ETFs: Big Payouts, Bigger Trade-Offs?",
        "content": "While a substantial amount of money continues to flow into low-cost, plain-vanilla ETFs, the ETF landscape is becoming increasingly complex, with most new launches being actively managed and many employing derivatives. Two recent regulatory changes\u2014the \u201cETF Rule\u201d and the \u201cDerivatives Rule\u201d\u2014have made it easier for providers to launch ETFs and incorporate derivatives into their strategies. The explosion in derivative-backed ETFs has been particularly striking. Most of these new derivative-based ETFs fall into one of three categories: Buffer or defined outcome ETFs Leveraged or inverse single-stock ETFs Option-based income ETFs Some of the newest products even combine options-selling strategies with leveraged single-stock ETFs. This article takes a closer look at ETFs that trade options on single stocks to generate exceptionally high yields\u2014among the hottest-selling funds in the market today. Thanks to their eye-catching distribution rates, these funds are generating significant buzz on social media. However, they generally underperform the underlying stocks, even as they continue to attract assets from investors drawn to their lucrative monthly payouts. Option Income ETFs: How the Strategy Works YieldMax currently offers more than 50 ETFs in U.S. markets, with total assets under management of about $14 billion. Though relatively new\u2014the oldest, TSLY, debuted in November 2022\u2014the suite has grown rapidly, largely driven by its headline-grabbing distribution yields of 100% or more. Inspired by this success, many copycat ETFs have entered the market. According to the provider, the primary investment objective of these funds is to seek current income; the secondary objective is to seek exposure to the price movement of the underlying stock, subject to a cap. These funds do not actually hold the underlying stocks. Instead, they gain synthetic exposure by taking long positions in call options and short positions in put options. They also hold Treasury securities for collateral and additional income. To generate monthly income, the fund manager sells call options against the synthetic long position. These calls typically have expirations of one month or less and strike prices about 0%\u201315% above the current share price. In some cases, managers use covered call spreads to further enhance yields. The YieldMax Reddit community has around 50,000 members, many of whom discuss using these ETFs to replace their 9-to-5 jobs or to generate retirement income. The four most popular products in the suite are linked to some of the hottest and most volatile stocks. The inherent volatility of these stocks leads to higher option premiums\u2014and higher potential income. Each of these ETFs has gathered over $1 billion in AUM. Yields are calculated by annualizing the most recent monthly payout and dividing it by the fund\u2019s latest NAV. However, yields can vary significantly from month to month, as income from selling options depends on fluctuations in the underlying stock, implied volatility, and other factors. Another provider, Kurv Investment Management, offers six Yield Premium ETFs that use derivatives on single technology stocks to generate income. Current distribution rates range between 12% and 29%. Like YieldMax, Kurv also uses synthetic covered call strategies to generate income, aiming to \u201cstrike a balance between income generation and potential upside capture.\u201d According to the provider, while some high-income ETFs experienced significant NAV erosion in 2024, their ETFs have shown \u201cstable NAV behavior.\u201d However, lower distribution yields have dampened investor interest in the product suite, with the most popular fund managing just over $22 million. Performance Since Inception We analyzed the total return\u2014including distributions\u2014of 24 single-stock covered call ETFs in the YieldMax suite and six ETFs in the Kurv suite from their respective inception dates versus their underlying stocks. Many of these ETFs launched in 2023\u2014providing a limited, yet meaningful, performance history. Despite their eye-popping distribution rates, these products tend to underperform on a total return basis due to steep declines in share price and resulting NAV erosion over time. Of the 24 YieldMax ETFs we examined, some underlying stocks surged, some declined, and others remained relatively flat\u2014but in every case except those tracking PayPal (PYPL) and Marathon Digital (MARA), the ETF underperformed the stock. For the four most popular products, the performance gap was substantial\u2014suggesting that investors may be leaving significant gains on the table in pursuit of yield. All six Kurv Single Stock ETFs have also underperformed their underlying stocks since inception. YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF (MSTY) The most popular product in the suite celebrated its one-year anniversary in February and now boasts $4.8 billion in assets. Since inception, it has delivered a total return of 285%, while MSTR stock has surged 437% over the same period. Once a little-known, money-losing software firm, Strategy (MSTR) has become the largest corporate holder of bitcoin and now trades like a leveraged bet on the cryptocurrency. Its stock commands a significant premium over the value of its bitcoin holdings. Some experts believe the financial engineering behind Strategy\u2014and the premium valuation\u2014may be unsustainable. If you're bullish on bitcoin, why not consider the iShares Bitcoin Trust IBIT, which charges just 0.25% and closely tracks the price of the asset? Image Source: Zacks Investment Research YieldMax TSLA Option Income Strategy ETF (TSLY) The oldest product in the suite holds $1.2 billion in assets. Since its debut in November 2022, the ETF has gained approximately 17%\u2014significantly underperforming Tesla (TSLA) shares, which are up about 91% over the same period. It has also lagged the S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 indexes, which have gained 55% and 88%, respectively. For context, low-cost index funds like the SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 ETF SPLG and Invesco NASDAQ 100 ETF QQQM charge just 0.02% and 0.15% in fees, while most option income products charge close to 1%. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research YieldMax NVDA Option Income Strategy ETF NVDY The second most popular product in the family has generated a total return of about 207% since its inception in May 2023. However, shares of the AI darling NVIDIA NVDA have risen approximately 392% over the same period. Still, the ETF has attracted $1.6 billion in assets. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research YieldMax COIN Option Income Strategy ETF (CONY) CONY, which tracks Coinbase COIN\u2014a major beneficiary of bitcoin\u2019s rise\u2014has returned 126% since its debut in August 2023. Over the same period, COIN stock has gained about 200%. The ETF currently sports a yield of 124% and has about $1.1 billion in assets. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Kurv Yield Premium Strategy Tesla ETF (TSLP) The most popular product in the Kurv suite has returned 44% since its inception in October 2023, whereas Tesla is up 57% over the same period. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Single-Stock Option Income ETFs vs. Diversified ETFs These ETFs sell one-month call options with strike prices slightly above the current stock price. In doing so, investors give up much of the upside if the stock rises while still bearing most of the downside if the stock falls\u2014creating an asymmetric risk-reward profile. By contrast, the JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF JEPI\u2014which helped launch the covered call trend\u2014uses a bottom-up fundamental process to construct a diversified, defensive portfolio of about 125 stocks.

This portfolio doesn\u2019t experience the outsized moves seen in names like Strategy or Coinbase, which explains why the performance shortfall may not be as pronounced. Bottom Line You should only invest in a fund tied to a single stock if you're bullish on that specific name\u2014in which case, you're generally better off owning the stock directly. If you expect the stock to decline, it\u2019s best to steer clear of any product linked to it. These ETFs may outperform if the underlying stock remains range-bound. However, since they use market swings as an income-generating strategy, don\u2019t expect jumbo distributions. If you\u2019re drawn to high monthly income and can accept an asymmetric risk-reward profile\u2014as well as potentially unfavorable and inconsistent tax treatment\u2014these funds may still appeal to you. ETFs have democratized access to markets, and innovation in the space has been remarkable. But with complex products like these, it\u2019s essential for investors to fully understand how they work\u2014and what outcomes are realistic.

        "content": "Stocks rose and oil prices retreated on Monday as investors shrugged off the continuation of hostilities between Israel and Iran over the weekend. The S&P 500 was up nearly 1% in midday trading Monday, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.4%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up just under 1%. Friday wasa rough dayon Wall Street\u2014oil prices surged, causing stocks to slide, theCboe Volatility Index(VIX) to jump, and gold to rise as investors moved into safe havens.\u00a0But there was plenty of evidence that investors weren\u2019t that concerned about the conflict spiraling out of control. High yieldcredit spreadsincreased just 2basis points, a sign of modest risk aversion, and the MSCI World Index closed just 1% off its all-time high. It\u2019s not out of the ordinary for markets to quickly shrug off major geopolitical events. TheS&P 500tends to fall about 6% in the three weeks after a geopolitical shock before recovering all of those losses in the following three weeks, according to a recent survey by Deutsche Bank analysts Parag Thatte and Binky Chadha. And with equity positioning historically low by their measure, a biggersell-offis even more unlikely today. Geopolitics has had a sustained impact on the stock market only when it\u2019s affected the real economy, whether by slowing growth or lifting inflation, Deutsche Bank analyst Henry Allen said in a note on Monday.There are only a few examples of oil shocks having a meaningful impact on stocks, including the oil embargo of the 1970s and Iraq\u2019s invasion of Kuwait in 1990. The most recent example of a geopolitical disruption to the stock market is Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, which bears some troubling resemblance to today. Inflation was already running above target when Russia\u2019s invasion drove oil prices up more than 30% in a matter of weeks. The oil- supply shock fueled an acceleration of already-elevated inflation, likely forcing central banks to raise interest rates faster and higher than they would have otherwise, Allen's report said. Inflation has moderated considerably since hitting a 40-year high in June 2022.Consumer pricesincreased 2.4%year-over-year in May, just slightly above the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% target. However, President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs threaten to raise prices, and their inflationary impact could be exacerbated by escalation in the Middle East. \u201cThe inflation risk really matters, because the problem with higher inflation is it will restrict central banks from cutting rates, as is currently priced,\u201d Allen wrote. The majority of investors are currently pricing in rate cuts of at least 100 basis points by the end of next year.Resurgent or sticky inflation would leave the Fedlittle room to cut interest ratesif tariffs and high oil prices weighed on growth or the labor market.",

Piper raised its target to $140 from $125 and maintained an \"overweight\" rating for AMD stock.Shares of AMD were at about $127 in recent trading, making Piper's target a roughly 10% premium. The analysts came away \"enthused\" by the firm's newly unveiled Helios server rack architecture, which it called \"pivotal\" for the growth of AMD Instinct GPUs. Helios will combine next-generation AMD MI400 chips into one larger system, the company said, and is expected in 2026.

        "content": "Shares of artificial intelligence (AI) chipmakerAdvanced Micro Devices(AMD8.71%)rallied 9.8% on Monday, as of 12:43 p.m. ET AMD made some big product announcements last week, especially around AI. Today, a Wall Street analyst wrote his positive conclusion on the event, and revealed some positive industry data in the PC space, too. Last week's big event centered on AMD's new Instinct MI350 accelerators, and upcoming MI400 \"Helios\" racks, which will be available next year. But onesell-side analystalso sees some optimistic signs in AMD's client business, which led to a price target bump today. On Monday,Piper Sandlersemiconductor analyst Harsh Kumar noted he is seeing some \"pull-ins\" in the client space, which used to be AMD's largest, but is now its second largest after data centers. The PC has been mired in somewhat of a downturn for a few years now, but a combination of aging pandemic-era PCs, new AI PC capabilities, pull-ins ahead of potential further tariffs, and the coming phaseout of the Windows 10 operating system may be spurring a nice refresh cycle. In addition, some investors were worried about the sequential decrease in AMD's data center and GPU revenue last quarter, where AMD hopes to compete more effectively againstNvidia. However, in the note today, Kumar also noted he sees a \"snap-back\" in that area, in the second half of the year, based on the new Instinct MI350 chips, which will be available in the second half of 2025, and \"Helios\" rack-scale systems, which will become available in the latter part of 2025. As a result, Kumar raised his price target on AMD to $140, up from $125. Image source: Getty Images. There are a lot of questions surrounding AMD at this moment, namely whether there is a place for its Instinct AI accelerators in the AI world where Nvidia currently dominates, and large cloud companies are all now building more custom AI silicon themselves. However, it appears as though last week's product even was encouraging on that front, and that AMD's AI design progress and acquisitions are beginning to garner enthusiasm among the analyst community.",

        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) stock jumped 2% Monday, putting the AI chip giant within striking distance of an all-time high after a furious turnaround over the past two months. The company continues to ride high on sales of its powerful AI chips to both hyperscalers and foreign countries seeking to build out their own sovereign AI systems. Shares closed at $144.69 each, about 3% off its record closing high. The latest jump comes after Nvidia held its GTC Paris event in the French capital last week. CEO Jensen Huang also attended the Viva Technology conference in the country. The company, which reported strong first quarter earnings in May, has been expanding into several spaces, including sovereign AI, which describes data centers funded, owned, or run by individual countries seeking to build out their AI capabilities. Nvidia took a starring role in President Trump's visit to the Middle East, where he struck deals with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates that will see the countries receive thousands of Nvidia AI chips. But the company is also dealing with the fallout from the Trump administration's ban on the sale of its chips to China. Nvidia reported a $4.5 billion hit during itsmost recent earnings announcementdue to the ban and says it anticipates an additional $8 billion write-down in the current quarter. Despite that, the company beat on revenue expectations thanks to the sale of its latest Blackwell chips and related server equipment. Email Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "content": "By Jamie McGeever ORLANDO, Florida (Reuters) - TRADING DAY Making sense of the forces driving global markets By Jamie McGeever, Markets Columnist Investor sentiment and risk appetite rebounded sharply on Monday as fears around the Israel-Iran conflict subsided, shifting the spotlight away from geopolitical risk and back towards this week's raft of central bank policy meetings. In my column today I look at why the dollar's status as a safe-haven asset in times of heightened geopolitical uncertainty may be fading in a world of 'de-dollarization'. More on that below, but first, a roundup of the main market moves. If you have more time to read, here are a few articles I recommend to help you make sense of what happened in markets today. 1. Iranian state broadcaster hit as Iran urges Trump tomake Israel halt war 2. Seeking unity, G7 meets amid escalating Ukraine, MiddleEast conflicts 3. Tariff 'stacking' adds another headache for U.S.importers 4. Investors shun long-term U.S. bonds as hopes foraggressive Fed rate cuts fade 5. Reuters interview with ECB Vice President de Guindos Today's Key Market Moves * Oil slides as much as 4% at one stage on Monday butBrent futures settle only 1.35% lower at $73.23/bbl, suggestinga chunky risk premium remains in the price. Oil spiked 7% onFriday. * Wall Street rebounds strongly, with the S&P 500 backabove 6000 points and the Nasdaq gaining 1.4%. * Nvidia shares rise 2% to the highest since January 24,within sight of the record peak of $153.13 from earlier thatmonth. Shares are up almost 70% from the post-'Liberation Day'low. * U.S. Treasury yields rise and the curve bear steepensdespite a pretty solid 20-year bond auction. Longer-dated yieldsup 5 bps. * Gold gives back Friday's gains, sliding more than 1% to$3,386/oz. The dollar rises 0.5% against the yen ahead of theBank of Japan's rate decision on Tuesday. Truce hopes spark rebound Signs of de-escalation between Israel and Iran - or at least hopes of de-escalation - ensured markets started this week much more positively than they finished last week. Whether that optimism is justified remains to be seen but the rebound was pretty strong, taking Wall Street and world stocks back to within sight of their recent highs. It's a very fluid situation, so investors' relief may be short-lived. Iran has called for U.S. President Donald Trump to get Israel to halt its attacks, but both countries continue to fire missiles at each other. Meanwhile, a U.S. official said Trump will not sign a draft G7 leaders' statement calling for de-escalation of the conflict. Optimism that a truce will be reached appears to be stronger in equity markets than elsewhere. Gold gave back Friday's gains but not before hitting $3,451 an ounce, a level last reached when it clocked a record high on April 17, and in volatile trade oil settled 1.7% lower, having surged more than 7% on Friday. Perhaps equity investors have it right. The oil price has less of a bearing on global growth or asset prices than it used to, and markets have been pretty resilient to Middle East conflicts in recent years, with selloffs proving to be shallow and short-lived. Unless there is a real adverse oil price shock, it will probably be a similar story this time around, although spiking inflation would be problematic for central banks. Economists at Oxford Economics sketch out an extreme scenario where the closure of the Strait of Hormuz pushes oil up to $130 a barrel, which could lift U.S. CPI inflation to almost 6%. Oil is nowhere near that yet though. As Deutsche Bank's Henry Allen notes, perhaps the story of the year is how resilient stock markets have been in the face of myriad large shocks - DeepSeek's emergence casting doubt over U.S. tech valuations; Europe's fiscal regime shift triggering the biggest daily jump in German yields since 1990; the U.S. losing its triple-A credit rating; Trump's tariffs and the S&P 500's fifth-biggest two-day fall since World War Two. And yet here we are, with world stocks at all-time highs. Aside from geopolitics, the focus for investors this week will mostly revolve around central banks. The Bank of Japan will deliver its policy decision on Tuesday, and economists expect it to hold off from raising rates again due to the uncertainty around U.S. tariffs. Later this week we have decisions from Indonesia, Brazil, Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, Britain and the U.S. Federal Reserve. Israel-Iran conflict highlights dollar's tarnished safe-haven appeal A dramatic spike in the potential for all-out war between Israel and Iran would typically be expected to spark an immediate and strong rally in the U.S. dollar, with investors seeking the safety and liquidity of the world's reserve currency. That didn't happen on Friday. The dollar's response to Israel's strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities and military commanders, followed by Tehran's initial threats and retaliation, was pretty feeble. The dollar index, a measure of the currency's value against a basket of major peers, ended the day up only around 0.25%. To be sure, the dollar fared better than U.S. stocks or Treasuries, which both fell sharply on Friday. But with oil surging over 7% and gold up a solid 1.5%, a strong 'flight to quality' flow would have lifted the dollar more than a quarter of one percent. The U.S. currency's move was particularly weak given the dollar's starting point on Friday. It was at a three-and-a-half year low, having depreciated 10% year to date, with sentiment and positioning heavily bearish. Yet a significant geopolitical shock generated barely a knee-jerk bounce. For comparison, the dollar rose more than 2% in both the first week of the 2006 Israel-Lebanon War and in the week following Israel's invasion of Southern Lebanon last year. The dollar's weak response to this latest Middle East conflict supports the narrative that investors are now reassessing their high exposure to dollars, in light of some of the unorthodox policies put forward by U.S. President Donald Trump in recent months. The dollar was down slightly early on Monday, and gold and oil were giving back some of Friday's gains too, as markets regained a foothold at the start of a busy week packed with key central bank meetings. PAINED SMILE The dollar has historically been one of the best hedges against short-term volatility sparked by geopolitical risk, behind gold and on a par with oil, according to research published last year by Joe Seydl, senior markets economist at JP Morgan Private Bank. Indeed, a Journal of Monetary Economics paper from last year stated plainly, \"The dollar is a safe-haven currency and appreciates when global risk goes up,\" a trend resulting from the \"fundamental asymmetry in a global financial system centered around the dollar\" built up over the course of several decades. That latter part of that argument hasn't changed. The dollar accounts for almost 60% of the world's $12 trillion FX reserves, with its nearest rival, the euro, accounting for around 20%. Almost two-thirds of global debt is denominated in dollars, and nearly 90% of all FX transactions around the world have the greenback on one side of the trade. That means traders, financial institutions, businesses, consumers and governments still need to be more exposed to dollars than any other currency, even if they question the direction of current U.S. policy. However, the dollar's downside 'structural' risks are growing, analysts at Westpac noted on Sunday, as concern over Washington's fiscal health and policy uncertainty erode the dollar's 'safe-haven identity'. Investors are now looking to hedge their large dollar exposure more than ever. If this dampens their instinctive demand for dollars in periods of sudden geopolitical tension, uncertainty and volatility, then the so-called 'dollar smile' theory could be challenged. This 'smile' is the idea that the dollar appreciates in periods of financial market stress as well as in 'risk on' periods of strong global growth and investor optimism, but sags in between. This idea was first outlined over 20 years ago by then currency analyst and now hedge fund manager Stephen Jen. If the Israel-Iran conflict continues to escalate, that dollar smile could get rather lopsided.

        "content": "Starbucks stock has frothier days ahead. That's the take of analysts at UBS, who late last week expressed confidence in CEO Brian Niccol\u2019s\"Back to Starbucks\"campaign, while raising its price target for Starbucks (SBUX) shares. Niccol previously brought Chipotle (CMG) back after anE. coli outbreak deterred customers. \u201cWe believe [Starbucks] turnaround plans should support a sales recovery over time, given CEO Niccol's track record and implementation of strategic initiatives across operations, marketing, product and customer experience,\u201d UBS wrote in a research note. The analysts maintained their \u201cneutral\u201d rating but raised their price target to $95, slightly above the average analyst price target of $92.64 compiled by Visible Alpha. Starbucks closed at $93.48 on Monday, about flat from last week and up 2.4% this year. UBS found a \u201cmodestly better\u201d improvement from 2024 to 2025 in the number of surveyed consumers who planned to visit a Starbucks in the coming year. Traffic could be boosted further when Niccol implements changes that consumers have indicated would bring them to Starbucks more frequently, includingvarying the menuandenhancing service, UBS added. Still, UBS acknowledged a turnaround will take time, given pressure on consumers in the U.S. and a belief that Starbucks is expensive. More than 70% of those who plan to cut back on Starbucks said the chain\u2019s prices were too high, according to UBS surveys. Deutsche Bank also found thatprice was the top deterrentin recent customer feedback. Starbucks\u2019 value perception has improved, but lags behind competitors and is particularly weak among higher earners, said UBS. About 24% of consumers earning up to $40,000 annually said Starbucks offers good value, while 3% of those making at least $100,000 felt that way, surveys found. \u201cWhile we don't expect a notable menu price rollback or significant increase in promotional activity, we believe an overall enhanced customer experience can improve value and value for the money perceptions,\u201d said UBS. Niccol's team also recently hosted a three-day leadership conference for Starbucks employees and announced plans to station a dedicated assistant store manager at most domestic stores.",

        "content": "In collaboration with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and NVIDIA, whitepaper introduces a framework for telco-verticalized AI agents, emphasizing ontology, reasoning, simulation, trust and brand engineering JERSEY CITY, NJ /ACCESS Newswire/ June 16, 2025 /Amdocs(NASDAQ:DOX), a leading provider of software and services to communications and media companies, today unveiled a new standard defining what makes a telco AI agent an advanced, verticalized enterprise offering. In a whitepaper titled \"AI Verticalization for Telcos,\" Amdocs presents an outline for telco-grade agents that are skilled, brand-engineered, trustworthy, and autonomous-capable of transforming how CSPs engage with customers and operate their networks. While the telecom sector has embraced generative AI at pace, many deployments fall short of true operational integration. This whitepaper defines a Telco-Grade Agent as one that is \"verticalized\"-deeply embedded with telco-specific skills, ontologies, and reasoning capabilities. These agents go beyond surface-level interactions, delivering network-aware, context-sensitive responses and executing intelligent decision-making rooted in domain expertise. \"In the age of AI, the difference between automation and intelligence lies in specialization,\" said Anthony Goonetilleke, Group President of Technology and Head of Strategy at Amdocs. \"Telco-grade agents aren't just smart-they're industry-native. They speak the language of networks, services, and customers, and they act with purpose. This framework ensures that CSPs don't just implement AI-they implement it right.\" Key aspects of a telco-specific AI agent include: Ontology is the Backbone of Telco Intelligence For AI agents to operate effectively in the telecommunications industry, they must understand the language, logic, and structure of telco systems. That's where ontology - a formal representation of domain knowledge that enables consistent data interpretation across platforms and tasks - becomes necessary. A well-defined telco ontology provides AI agents with a contextual understanding of service plans, technical specifications, billing structures, and customer interactions. To support this, a robust ingestion pipeline is needed-capable of handling a variety of data types that agents rely on, including real-time streams, time series data, and other structured and unstructured sources. By leveraging in-context learning and telco-specialized large language models (LLMs), agents gain advanced reasoning capabilities and adaptability. This structured framework ensures AI agents deliver accurate, relevant, and uniform responses, while allowing for seamless collaboration across systems and sub-agents. Autonomy and Predictive Reasoning That Works AI agents must operate with true autonomy-detecting issues, initiating actions, collaborating with other agents, and escalating to humans when needed-all before a customer ever reaches out. This shift from reactive support to proactive service unlocks measurable gains in efficiency and customer satisfaction. Beyond access to telco data, agents must be able to reason with it-applying domain-specific logic, workflows, and best practices to deliver decisions and actions aligned with industry expectations. This is what enables truly intelligent, telco-effective autonomy. Digital Twin and Simulation For operators, a digital twin is a real-time virtual replica of their physical network, designed to support reliable, data-driven decision-making. By continuously ingesting data and enabling high-fidelity simulations, it provides actionable insights that lead to trusted, efficient execution. Data, analytics, and AI/ML form the core foundation of any effective digital twin. Simulation plays a critical role by offering a safe and scalable environment to train and test AI agents. It allows agentic AI to learn complex decision-making, anticipate outcomes, adapt strategies, and operate autonomously-without real-world risk. When combined with a telecom network digital twin-fed in real time by data from base stations, routers, and user devices-this creates an autonomous network that can self-optimize, dynamically manage resources, and even self-heal. The result: improved performance, lower operational costs, and a significantly enhanced customer experience. Brand Engineering: Designing the Digital Face of the Enterprise As AI agents become the first touchpoint between companies and their customers-across industries, not just in telecom-how they sound, look, and respond carries real brand weight. Agents can't just be generic; they must embody the voice, tone, and personality of the brand in action. This shift matters because customers are paying attention. In aglobal study* commissioned by Amdocs in collaboration with McCann Tech agency and Coleman Parkes, 80% of consumers said they trust AI agents to resolve service issues, and 60% believe AI can positively shape their perception of a brand-when done right. That trust isn't automatic; it's earned through intentional design, from the agent's voice and visual presence to the way it behaves and adapts to each interaction. Trust Can't Be Trivial Enterprise-grade Agents must also possess robust non-functional capabilities. These horizontal capabilities encompass crucial aspects like trust and security, which are fundamental to the reliability and effectiveness of GenAI solutions in the telecommunications sector. By integrating these horizontal attributes, telco agents not only enhance their service delivery but also ensure that operations are secure, compliant, and trustworthy, thereby fostering stronger customer relationships and confidence. Ongoing Collaboration with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and NVIDIA Amdocs continues to work closely with NVIDIA to integrateNVIDIA's full-stack AI foundry service- a collection of NVIDIA AI Foundation Models, NVIDIA NeMo\u2122 framework and tools, andNVIDIA DGX\u2122 Cloudthat gives enterprises an end-to-end solution for creating custom generative AI models - with Amdocs' generative AI offering, amAIz Suite. The collaboration has focused on harnessing generative AI to transform customer experiences, network automation and deliver operational efficiencies. Amdocs leveraged NVIDIA DGX\u2122 Cloud on AWS to test and tune multiple models, while usingNVIDIA NIMmicroservices, a part of theNVIDIA AI Enterprisesoftware platform, to rapidly deploy models for seamless, scalable inference with industry-standard APIs. Amdocs has partnered with AWS to build enterprise-grade, cloud-native AI solutions that deliver production-ready capabilities for communication service providers (CSPs). Through this collaboration, Amdocs' amAIz Suite integrates the comprehensive generative AI stack of AWS-includingAmazon Bedrockfor foundation model access, AWS purpose-built data services for real-time processing, and scalable cloud infrastructure-to enable telco-grade agents that meet the critical requirements for enterprise AI: adaptability, scalability, data integration, and adherence to privacy and security standards. Amdocs, AWS, and NVIDIA have demonstrated several collaborations that show the real-world impact of GenAI in telecom. The first, presented at Digital Transformation World Asia, explored how GenAI can enhance billing and customer care and sales experiences. The second, unveiled at Mobile World Congress Barcelona and NVIDIA GTC, introduced a framework for autonomous network operations through intelligent network agents. Amdocs will be demonstrating its joint AI agent solutions with NVIDIA atTM Forum's Digital Transformation World Ignitein Copenhagen, June 17-19, 2025. *Survey, interviews and focus groups of 120 CSP leaders and 7,025 consumers aged 18-69 in 14 countries across North America, Europe, and Asia.
