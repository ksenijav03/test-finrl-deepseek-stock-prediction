        "header": "Should You Buy Nvidia While It's Below $150?",
        "content": "The earlier part of the year wasn't easy for market superstarNvidia(NVDA-0.41%). The stock slumped for a few reasons -- from worries about U.S. export controls on artificial intelligence (AI) chips for the Chinese market and a U.S. plan to set tariffs on imports, to concerns about technology spending. Each of these areas represents a risk for the leading AI chip designer, and that kept the stock trading well below $150. In fact, at its lowest, Nvidia slipped to less than $100 earlier in the year. But, in recent weeks, the stock has rebounded, erasing losses for the year and showing signs of renewed momentum -- and it's now just a few dollars away from $150. Though the export control issue remains, the other headwinds have eased. Technology companies in recent earnings reports say they continue to pour investment into AI, a good sign for Nvidia. As for the tariffs, President Donald Trump has signed initial agreements with the U.K. and China that offer investors optimism the duties may not dramatically impact corporate earnings. Considering all of this, should you get in on Nvidia while it's below $150? Image source: Getty Images. Nvidia soared into the spotlight in recent years thanks to one wise move: the decision to focus on the AI marketbeforeeveryone was talking about AI. Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) originally served the gaming market, but more than a decade ago, the company saw the potential of AI and shifted focus. From that point on, \"every chip that we made was focused on artificial intelligence,\" CEO Jensen Huang told CNBC in a 2023 interview. This has been a winning bet for Nvidia because in recent years, data center revenue -- which encompasses AI products and services -- has skyrocketed. In the latest fiscal year, revenue surged in the triple digits to a record $130 billion. But Nvidia isn't only growing revenue. The company also has significantly increased net income thanks to its high profitability on sales -- gross margin has surpassed 70% in recent quarters, and Nvidia aims for that to continue. (In the most recent quarter, Nvidia booked a charge for lost sales in China linked to export restrictions, pushing gross margin to about 60% -- but excluding this, the margin figure once again surpassed 70%.) Speaking of China, this is one area that investors have worried about, since the region did account for 13% of sales as recently as last year. But it's important to keep in mind that Nvidia generates the lion's share of its revenue from U.S. customers, so even thoughthe China situationmay weigh on growth, it's unlikely to considerably slow down this AI giant. Last year, Nvidia brought in more than $61 billion in revenue from the U.S., and demand continues to grow as more and more customers seek computing power forAI inference-- an area of expertise for Nvidia's new Blackwell architecture and chip. Rivals, of course, also represent a headwind. For example,Advanced Micro Devicesrecently launched MI350, a family of chips that aims to challenge Nvidia's Blackwell. But even with a high-performing GPU, it will be difficult to unseat Nvidia, especially since this market leader innovates on an annual basis -- this makes it particularly tough for a competitor to make a significant mark on Nvidia's market share. And, considering demand ahead, there's likely plenty of room for Nvidia and a competitor like AMD to each generate major growth in this market. Today, the AI infrastructure buildout continues in a big way, and at the same time, new phases of AI growth -- such as the use of AI agents to apply AI to real-world problems -- are just beginning. Nvidia has wisely built an entire portfolio of AI products and services so that it can benefit from every stage of AI development and use. All of this means that, even though Nvidia has delivered double-digit growth in recent times, this growth story is likely to continue well into the future. Should you buy Nvidia while it's below $150? Even if you buy Nvidia once it passes that level, if you hold on for the long term, you could be setting yourself up for significant gains. So, you don't have to rush to get in on the stock right this second. But Nvidia makes a compelling buy now considering its current valuation -- trading at 33 timesforward earnings estimates, down from more than 50 earlier in the year. While Nvidia is trading around these levels -- and under $150 -- it makes an excellent addition to your AI portfolio.",

        "content": "SunRun (RUN) shares plunged Tuesday, leading a steep sell-off in solar energy stocks after the Senate maintained thefull removal of clean-energy tax creditsin its version of the budget bill. The move comes after SunRun and otherbellwether solar names tumbled last monthafter the House passed a tax and spending bill that would end tax credits for wind and solar projects in 2029, years earlier than a previous version of the bill. Following today's development, Citi maintained its sell rating on residential solar stocks and cautioned that it expects a \u201csharp pullback\u201d in shares of SunRun, SolarEdge Technologies (SEDG) and Enphase Energy (ENPH). SunRun shares fell 40% on Tuesday, closing the session at $5.78. The stock has lost three-quarters of its value since hitting its 52-week high last August, weighed down by uncertainty surrounding the sector caused be policy changes, a clouded regulatory outlook and reduced demand. Below, we take a closer look at SunRun\u2019sweekly chartand usetechnical analysisto identify key price levels worth watching out for. Since topping out in early 2021, SunRun shares have remained entrenched in a steadydowntrend, with losses in the stock accelerating after the 50-week moving average (MA) crossed below the 200-week MA in September 2022 to form adeath cross. More recently, a chart pattern that closely resembles afalling three methodshas emerged, signaling a continuation of the stock\u2019s long-term move lower. What\u2019s more, therelative strength indexhas fallen back below its neutral threshold, confirming a resumption of selling momentum. It\u2019s also worth noting thattrading volumehas increased in recent weeks, indicating growing interest in the stock from bothretail and institutional investors. Let\u2019s identify two keysupport levelsto watch on SunRun\u2019s chart if the price keeps falling and also locate overhead areas worth monitoring during future recovery efforts in the stock. Firstly, it\u2019s worth keeping a close eye on the key $4.75 level. This area may attract strong buying interest near an established floor of support that formed on the chart between October 2016 and May 2017. Abreakdownbelow this level could see the shares drop to around $4.33. We projected this level by taking a look what happened when the stock dropped by more than 40% in a week during the March 2020 pandemic-driven sell-off. On that occasion, the shares dropped a further 25% the following week before staging a dramatic recovery. Therefore, a decline of a similar magnitude from Tuesday's close of $5.78 projects adownsidetarget of $4.33, assuming the stock ends this week around its current trading levels. However, keep in mind this analysis is speculative, given the stock fell by more than 40% in a week last month and has kept moving lower. During recovery efforts in the stock, investors should monitor the $8.50 area. The shares may face renewed selling pressure in this region near prominenttroughsthat formed on the chart in March 2020 and October 2023. Finally, buying above this level could see an upswing toward $13.25. Investors who have bought SunRun shares at lower levels may seek tolock in profitsat this location near last month\u2019s high, which also closely aligns with a range of corresponding trading activity on the chart extending back to mid-2018.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan joined a yearslong US campaign to curtail China\u2019s technological ascent when it blacklisted the country\u2019s AI and chipmaking champions, an unprecedented step that may signal a resurgent effort to isolate its powerful neighbor\u2019s semiconductor sector. Most Read from Bloomberg Security Concerns Hit Some of the World\u2019s \u2018Most Livable Cities\u2019 How E-Scooters Conquered (Most of) Europe As Part of a $45 Billion Push, ICE Prepares for a Vast Expansion of Detention Space JFK AirTrain Cuts Fares 50% This Summer to Lure Riders Off Roads Taser-Maker Axon Triggers a NIMBY Backlash in its Hometown Taipei this month added Huawei Technologies Co. and its main chipmaker Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. to its entity list, barring the island\u2019s firms from doing business with the pair without a license. It was the first time Taiwanese officials have used that blacklist to sanction major Chinese firms, taking a cue from a longstanding US approach of blocking access to advanced technologies. The move also marks Taipei\u2019s first public action on semiconductor restrictions since President Lai Ching-te pledged in April to address unspecified concerns from Washington about export controls. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has urged Taipei to take more ownership over chip restrictions on China, people familiar with the matter said, with a particular focus on enforcement of existing curbs. They requested anonymity as they weren\u2019t authorized to speak publicly. A congressional committee focused on China, meanwhile, said after Taipei\u2019s move that the US \u201cmust continue working with our partners to ensure the CCP\u2019s attempts to illegally transfer tech are stopped cold.\u201d Taipei\u2019s decision may be the first of a series of measures tightening the flow of technology to China, marking a departure from a policy of nurturing cross-Strait business ties. The longer-term goal may be to throttle supply of the vital components, silicon materials and plant construction expertise that helped transform Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. into the world\u2019s most advanced chip operation. \u201cThis recent shift marks a substantive move toward strategic technological competition with China,\u201d said Chiang Min-yen, an analyst at Taiwan\u2019s government-funded Research Institute for Democracy, Society and Emerging Technology. \u201cCompared to other tech democracies with similar industrial structures \u2014 such as Japan and South Korea \u2014 Taiwan is now taking a more decisive stance.\u201d Lai didn\u2019t specify in his April comments what steps Taiwan would take in response to US concerns, but instead described a broader strategy to boost trade relations with the US. It\u2019s unclear whether the Huawei and SMIC sanctions are related to ongoing tariff negotiations with Washington, or whether the US requested that specific step. The US Department of Commerce, White House and Taiwan\u2019s Office of Trade Negotiations didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. \u201cThe DPP authorities\u2019 kneeling and ingratiating themselves with the US will only hurt and ruin Taiwan\u2019s interests,\u201d Foreign Ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun told a press briefing in Beijing, referring to the ruling party in Taipei. \u201cChina opposes the US politicizing tech and trade issues, overstretching the concept of national security, abusing export control and long-arm jurisdiction, and maliciously blocking and suppressing China.\u201d A Trump administration official, meanwhile, said the US supports any steps its allies take to align with Washington policy and prevent the circumvention of controls. The US has pressured Taiwan to do more since Trump\u2019s first term, when officials urged Taipei to block sales of TSMC chips to China \u2014 before Washington imposed restrictions on some of TSMC\u2019s shipments to the world\u2019s second-largest economy. Under President Joe Biden, the US continually ramped up those China controls, which span both chips and the tools used to make them. Many of the US measures use an authority known as the foreign direct product rule to restrict some activities of foreign firms \u2014 including Taiwanese ones \u2014 whose products contain even the tiniest bit of American tech. One major focus for American officials \u2014 under Trump as well as his predecessor \u2014 is ensuring that Taipei cracks down on TSMC sales that are restricted under US rules, said people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named discussing private conversations. Last year, TSMC, the go-to chipmaker for Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp., unwittingly manufactured 2.9 million AI dies for Huawei, based on estimates from researchers. Those semiconductors were routed via an intermediary that has since been sanctioned by the US government and cut off by TSMC, which is cooperating with Washington\u2019s ongoing investigation into the matter. But there also are a host of other business activities not captured by Washington\u2019s curbs \u2014 things like construction contracts or sales of certain components. In 2023, Bloomberg News reported that several Taiwanese companies were helping Huawei build infrastructure for an under-the-radar network of chip plants across southern China. Taiwanese officials said they would probe into those companies shortly after, but they\u2019ve refrained from taking significant action \u2014 until now. It\u2019s unusual for Beijing\u2019s neighbors, who still see China as a crucial trading partner, to openly target its most strategic companies. While Japan joined a US-led campaign to limit China\u2019s access to advanced chipmaking equipment, neither Tokyo nor Seoul has blacklisted Huawei or SMIC entirely. On its face, Taiwan\u2019s entity list action doesn\u2019t immediately upend routine business, in part because it doesn\u2019t apply to mainland-registered operations. Many Taiwanese companies have set up local subsidiaries to handle their business in mainland China over the years, and Taipei doesn\u2019t have jurisdiction over such entities. \u201cI don\u2019t expect this announcement will cause any material impact for either Taiwan or Huawei and SMIC,\u201d said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Steven Tseng. \u201cHuawei and SMIC don\u2019t really rely on Taiwan as they should have established a pretty decent level of \u2018local sourcing\u2019 in China after all these years.\u201d It\u2019s the signal Lai is sending that\u2019s important. The new president has been working to reduce economic interdependence between China and Taiwan. His Democratic Progressive Party released a video over the weekend arguing that Taiwanese companies should look to diversify away from China \u2014 a shift from decades of the island\u2019s firms establishing a substantial presence on the mainland. Foxconn Technology Group built the world\u2019s largest iPhone assembly campus in central China, while TSMC runs chipmaking sites in Shanghai and Nanjing. Tensions escalated after Lai was elected last year. Beijing has accused him of seeking independence and destabilizing the region. Bilateral ties were further strained after Lai labeled China a \u201cforeign hostile force\u201d for the first time and unveiled wide-ranging measures to counter infiltration efforts. China claims the self-governing democracy is its territory and has vowed to unify with Taiwan, using force if necessary \u2014 a stance Taiwan rejects. Taiwan\u2019s annual investment in China peaked at $14.6 billion in 2010, though that spending plummeted to $3.6 billion last year. \u201cLai will now be able to speed up his agenda-setting against China on several fronts including defense, trade and tech, thanks to the changes in the global environment,\u201d said Soong Hseik-wen, director of the Center for National Policy Research at Taiwan\u2019s National Chung Cheng University. --With assistance from Debby Wu, Catherine Lucey, James Mayger and Michael Shepard.

        "header": "Why the UK's AIM is struggling 30 years on",
        "content": "The UK's alternative investment market (AIM) has seen some major successes since its inception 30 years ago but has struggled to attract and retain companies in recent years. Launched on 19 June 1995, AIM was set up to help smaller and high-growth companies get more access to capital. When it started out, the UK's junior market comprised of just 10 companies, with a total market valuation of \u00a382m. Eleven of the companies that joined AIM in its first six months of existence are still on the UK stock market today and eight of those companies are still on the junior market today, according to AJ Bell (AJB.L). Since launch, AIM has helped more than 4,000 companies raise nearly \u00a3136bn. Well-known companies that started out on AIM include travel company Jet2 (JET2.L), online retailer ASOS (ASC.L) and drink mixer producer Fevertree (FEVR.L). While AIM has produced a number of successes, it has also had its fair share of failures. That includes \"cash shell\" Langbar International, which claimed to have \u00a3370m in bank deposits but collapsed in 2005 after discovering these funds were non-existent. Another high-profile example was the collapse of cafe chain Patisserie Valerie in 2019 on the back of an accounting scandal. Such disasters have led to AIM being described as the \"Wild West\", though it is said to be the most active growth market in Europe, with 45% of the capital raised on European growth markets over the past five years raised on AIM, according to the London Stock Exchange (LSE). Read more:Bank of England expected to hold interest rates as oil prices rise and UK growth falters In addition, an analysis conducted by Grant Thornton found that, in 2023, AIM companies contributed \u00a368bn in gross value added to the UK economy and supported more than 770,000 jobs. Even so, AIM has had a challenging time in recent years and research has suggested that its troubles are set to continue. According to investment bank Peel Hunt (PEEL.L) and Aberdeen Investments, AIM is set to shrink by a fifth this year, as 61 companies representing \u00a312.3bn of market capitalisation have announced plans to leave the junior market \u2014 either to move to the main market, to delist or because they've been subject to mergers and acquisitions (M&A). If all of these moves go ahead, AIM is set to shrink by 20%. \u201cAIM was once a thriving market, but it has been brutally knocked back by outflows in recent times,\" said Abby Glennie, co-manager of the Abrdn UK Smaller Companies Fund and the Abrdn UK Smaller Companies Growth Trust plc (AUSC.L). \"As a result, we\u2019re seeing many of the biggest and best AIM companies moving to a main market listing.\" She added: \"Eventually we will be left with a tiny, illiquid market. That\u2019s fine for small, individual investors but will make it very hard to get large-scale institutional money into the growth companies of tomorrow. \"In that scenario, we need to be asking: how are we going to nurture the next generation of big UK companies?\" With that in mind, experts shared why AIM is struggling and what could be done to help revive the junior market and resolve these issues. Jason Hollands, managing director at Bestinvest by Evelyn Partners, said that the sharp decline in companies on AIM largely \"reflects a wider malaise facing European markets for small and medium sized growth stocks in recent years, as well amplifying the broader headwinds \u2018unloved\u2019 UK equities have faced.\" \"Let\u2019s not forget that there has been a dearth of IPOs on the London Stock Exchange\u2019s main market too in recent years, with a steady stream of UK companies moving their listings overseas to markets like NASDAQ (^IXIC) and the NYSE where they can command higher valuations due to deeper pools of capital,\" he said. Hollands added that there have also been a number of public-to-private transactions by private equity firms, which are able to pick up UK-listed businesses on low valuations. \"AIM has been at the sharp end of these trends, magnifying the effect given the lack of investor appetite for small, illiquid UK companies amid an environment where passives have grown in popularity,\" he said. Hollands explained that tracker funds don't touch very small companies, so the trend towards index funds \"sucked away capital from this part of the marked as actively managed funds have battled relentless outflows\". Instead, he said that the focus has been on a relatively small group of mega-cap growth US stocks \u2014 the \"Magnificent 7\", which is made up of Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL,GOOG), Tesla (TSLA), Amazon (AMZN) and Meta (META). In addition, Hollands said that smaller companies have had to contend with the impact of thepandemic, thecost of living crisis, along with increases in financing costs as interest rates and bond yields rose. Stocks:Create your watchlist and portfolio Nicholas Hyett, investment manager at Wealth Club, said that AIM's \"recent struggles are due in part to powerful macro-economic trends affecting public markets all over the world, however they\u2019ve been compounded by a series of unfortunate own goals.\" Firstly, he highlighted that the rise of venture capital and private equity has meant that public markets are playing a smaller part in fundraising globally. He pointed to data from law firm White & Case, which showed that initial public offerings raised $126bn in 2024 \u2014 a marginal increase on 2023, though that is well below the $211bn raised in 2018. \"Companies just don\u2019t want to list on stock markets to raise money any more,\" said Hyett. \"Staying private is lower cost and significantly less hassle than accepting the scrutiny that comes from being a public company.\" In addition, Hyett said AIM had also struggled with a number of \"political own goals \u2014 most notably around theinheritance tax(IHT) benefits associated with AIM companies.\" \"IHT relief has been a key driver of AIM ownership \u2014 creating a reason for individual investors to hold shares in AIM listed companies that they might not otherwise consider \u2014 providing a stable investor base that might not otherwise invest in smaller UK companies,\" he explained. Read more:What you need to know about UK's private stock market Pisces Historically, if investors held AIM shares for at least two years at the time of death, they would be exempt from IHT because they qualified for business property relief. However, changes to IHT in theautumn budgetmeant that the rate of relief was halved from 100% to 50%, meant that AIM holdings will be subject to 20% tax for those with estates above their nil-rate allowances. Bestinvest's Hollands said: \"While this was not the worst outcome, it has reduced the attraction and the recent leaking of a memo of tax proposals by [deputy prime minister] Angela Rayner, included scrapping all IHT relief on AIM, will renew speculation at a time when concerns are mounting that the chancellor will need to find further tax raising measures in her next budget.\" Indeed, Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that \"perception can often count when it comes to interest in certain sectors, and with this tax-benefit changing, it could still mean more investors will steer clear from these riskier investments.\" \"Withinflation creeping back upwards againand the UK economy sluggish, confidence doesn\u2019t look set to return to the market anytime soon and depressed valuations are likely to mean overseas buyers will be circling AIM quoted firms this year,\" she said.\" Bestinvest's Hollands said that one potential \"ray of sunshine\" could be the Mansion House Accord, which was a government agreement with the UK's largest workplace pension schemes to invest 10% into private markets by 2030, at least half of which has to be in the UK. \"One can only hope that some of this might eventually find its way into AIM companies, but a lot more could be done to revitalise the market, including beefing up VCT income tax reliefs to at least 40% and quashing speculation of tampering with IHT reliefs again,\" he said. Stocks:Create your watchlist and portfolio Wealth Club's Hyett said that uncertainty over IHT relief \"needs to be resolved and as soon as possible\". \"While the uncertainty remains, the flow of money into AIM will be stifled and the government risks slowly throttling the UK\u2019s growth market,\" he said. \"Longer term, AIM faces the same challenges as the wider stock market. Steps need to be taken to encourage UK investors, including pension funds, to put money into UK companies if you want to revitalise the UK stock market.\" Read more: This under-claimed benefit could help boost your pension Average UK house asking price drops by more than \u00a31,000 Why you can trust an 18-year old with their junior ISA \u2013 and how to create one Download the Yahoo Finance app, available forAppleandAndroid.",

        "content": "Ten public companies have achieved a market value exceeding $1 trillion as of June 16. They are listed below in descending order based on upside implied by the median target price set by Wall Street analysts. Wall Street clearly sees Nvidia as the best trillion-dollar stock to buy right now. Here's what investors should know about the chipmaker. Image source: Getty Images. Nvidia is the market leader in data centergraphics processing units(GPUs), chips used to accelerateartificial intelligence(AI) training and inference tasks. The company is also the market leader in InfiniBand networking equipment, the leading connectivity technology for back-end AI networks. Importantly, Nvidia has struggled with two headwinds throughout the year. First, Chinese start-upDeepSeekdeveloped sophisticatedlarge language modelsusing fewer GPUs than U.S. competitors, causing investors to worry demand would decline. Second, the Trump administrationrestricted the export of H20 GPUsbuilt for the Chinese market, effectively preventing Nvidia from operating in the country. Nvidia more or less put the first concern to rest with impressive first-quarter financial results that exceeded expectations on the top and bottom lines. Revenue increased 69% to $44 billion due to what CEO Jensen Huang characterized as \"incredibly strong\" demand for Nvidia AI infrastructure. Andnon-GAAP(adjusted) net income jumped 33% to $0.81 per diluted share. However, while first-quarter results show robust demand, export controls still hurt Nvidia. The company took a $4.5 billion charge due to excess H20 inventory, and adjusted earnings would have increased 57% to $0.96 per diluted share had the Trump administration not imposed new restrictions. Huang also said the company will miss out on $8 billion in sales in the July-ending quarter. Nevertheless,Morgan Stanleybelieves the downside related to export restrictions is fully priced into the stock and that Nvidia will eventually be able to participate in the Chinese market to some degree. \"China is entirely derisked, at least for direct shipments, and we are optimistic that there will be some path to monetize at least a portion of that demand,\" analysts wrote in a recent note. Grand View Research estimates the data center GPU market will expand at 28.5% annually through 2030, while spending across AI hardware, software, and services increases at 35.9% annually during the same period. Nvidia is exceptionally well positioned to benefit from that explosive growth. Wall Street expects Nvidia's adjusted earnings to increase at 40% annually through the fiscal year ending January 2027. That makes the current valuation of 45times adjusted earningslook reasonable, especially when Nvidia beat the consensus estimate by an average of 4% in the last six quarters. As a caveat, the semiconductor industry is cyclical, meaning Nvidia's sales tend to ebb and flow as companies intermittently invest in chips and other data center infrastructure. For instance, revenue growth could slow toward the beginning of fiscal 2027 as the company ramps up production of its next-generation Rubin GPU (slated to launch in the second half of next year). However, investors should also bear in mind that Nvidia has a substantial opportunity in its often overlooked automotive and robotics segment, which currently accounts for less than 2% of total sales.Generative AIhas been in the spotlight since ChatGPT launched in late 2022, but Huang says the \"ChatGPT moment\" forautonomous carsandrobotsis right around the corner. Importantly, Nvidia has three computing platforms that address those markets: data center infrastructure to train models, a simulation engine to test those models, and embedded systems that handle on-board computing. Also, the company provides software tools that help developers build the necessary applications. Here's the bottom line: Nvidia enjoys a leadership position in a quickly growing market, and shares trade at a reasonable valuation. The stock price may be volatile over relatively short periods (i.e., months) due to the cyclical nature of the industry, but Nvidia still has a long runway for growth as the physical AI (autonomous cars and robots) market takes shape.",

        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) investors loveNvidia. One stock has crushed its returns in the last few months:CoreWeave(CRWV8.45%). The stock in the AI-focused cloud computing provider (and large Nvidia customer) is up 268% since its initial public offering (IPO) in late March, while Nvidia stock is flat year to date as of June 15. Investors are falling in love with the rapid growth at CoreWeave and its huge growth projections when it comes to AI and the cloud. Are you missing out by not owning CoreWeave stock to play the AI boom? Image source: Getty Images. CoreWeave stock has gone up and to the right since its initial public offering (IPO). This is common among popular IPO stocks, as they generally have a low publicly traded float -- meaning the amount of shares you can buy and sell each day -- before its lock-up period ends for insiders. A lock-up period is when insiders cannot sell shares after the IPO, and usually lasts three to six months. This led CoreWeave's stock to rise 268% in just a few months. Its revenue is growing like wildfire, up 420% year over year last quarter to $982 million. In 2025, the company expects to generate around $5 billion in revenue, which is up from basically zero in 2022. That means CoreWeave has gone from zero to $5 billion in revenue in less than five years, making it one of the fastest growing companies in market history. Why is CoreWeave growing so quickly? Because AI developers are flocking to its cloud platform to utilize its data centers for training and running AI systems. CoreWeave was built from the ground up for AI systems, which is why it now has a backlog of $25.9 billion. To be clear, it is not going to dethrone the other cloud providers, but it is increasingly nabbing share in the all-important AI growth category. Guidance calls for major growth in the future. In 2025 alone, CoreWeave is expecting to spend at least $20 billion on capital expenditures, or around 4 times its revenue estimates for the year. This means the company is laying out a huge amount of capital ahead of expected future demand as it hopes to capture more and more cloud spending related to AI. Being a global cloud provider is expensive. You have to spend billions of dollars ahead of time to build data centers, getting returns steadily in the future as your customers pay for computing capacity. All this aggressive spending will lead to huge cash burn. CoreWeave had negative free cash flow of $1.35 billion in the first quarter of 2025. This burn is expected to accelerate in the upcoming quarters given management's guidance for capital expenditures. For 2025, $5 billion in revenue vs. $20 billion in capital expenditures means at least a $15 billion free cash burn, and that is before considering any overhead costs. This will require a lot of capital raising, as the company has well under $5 billion in cash on the balance sheet. Management will likely need to take out more debt and sell more shares of its common stock in order to get the cash needed for these capital expenditures. It will not be cheap. Bulls may argue that CoreWeave is the future of cloud computing, one of the largest industries in the world that has brought riches toAmazon,Microsoft, andAlphabetshareholders. It has fast-growing revenue, a large backlog, and is one of the hottest stocks out there. However, at a market cap of $70 billion, I think CoreWeave stock is too richly valued for investors at the moment, and would lean to side with any bears who are hesitant to buy the stock today. The company has loaded up its balance sheet with debt, which has high interest expenses. More debt may be coming in order to finance its ambitious capital expenditure plans in 2025. Even if the company reaches its guidance for $5 billion in revenue this year, CoreWeave will be trading at a price-to-sales ratio (P/S) of 14.2, which is an aggressive valuation for any stock, let alone one with such a large free-cash-flow burn and debt levels. Stay away from CoreWeave; this a risky stock to add to your portfolio right now.",

        "content": "Nvidia(NVDA-0.10%)reported yet another quarter of strong growth with its fiscal first quarter 2026 earnings. Revenue rose a massive 69% year over year and was up 12% sequentially. Demand from data centers was the big driver of performance, with revenue from this customer group up 73% year over year. That level of growth is the big reason these three stocks will be great buy-and-hold investments if you want to tap into AI growth. Nvidia is performing exceptionally well as a business. But this isn't a secret, and the stock price is up over 1,400% over the past five years. Although the stock's price-to-sales andprice-to-earnings ratiosare reasonable when compared to their five-year averages, it would be hard to suggest that Nvidia is a cheap stock. Indeed, the P/E ratio is a lofty 45x. A lot of good news is already priced in here. Image source: Getty Images. The glass-half-full argument is that Nvidia has a lot of good news to offer, and there's no sign that the good news is going to stop flowing. Butartificial intelligence(AI) is still a very young industry. At one point, Yahoo! looked like a category killer in search, but it was still surpassed byAlphabet's Google service. It is still early days in AI, and it remains difficult to predict which companies, from Nvidia toPalantirTechnologies, will be the long-term winners. But there's one thing that is very clear: AI and thedata centersin which it lives are going to increase demand for electricity by a massive amount. By the National Electrical Manufacturers Association's estimate, the increase in electricity demand will be around 300% over just the next decade. And that will lead to a step change in the demand for electricity. Demand rose by a grand total of 9% between 2000 and 2020 but is expected to increase by 55% between 2020 and 2040. AI is great, but it stops working if you turn off the power switch. And it draws a massive amount of power from the electrical grid. AI growth is going to be good for electricity providers across the board. The safest play is probablya utilitylikeNextEra Energy(NEE-0.35%). This company is really two businesses in one. NextEra owns one of the largest regulated utilities in the United States, giving it a solid business foundation. But on top of that, it has built one of the world's largest clean energy businesses. That has helped NextEra grow very rapidly, and the company has increased its dividend at a compound annual rate of 10% over the past decade. That is huge dividend growth for any company, let alone a utility. Add in an attractive 3.1%dividend yieldand growth and income investors, as well as AI aficionados, will want to get to know NextEra Energy. Forincome-focused investors, however,Brookfield Renewable Partners(BEP-2.01%)will probably be the better choice. It has a huge 5.7% yield and a history of regular distribution growth, though at a slower rate than that of NextEra Energy. The big story here, however, is the fact that data centers are increasingly trying to find ways to use clean power for their properties. The headline for Brookfield Renewable on that front is that it has inked a deal withMicrosoftto provide 10.5 gigawatts of power to the tech giant. The specific purpose of the agreement is to power Microsoft's data centers. Brookfield Renewable is not a regulated utility, so it can sell power to any company anywhere in the world, given its diversified portfolio ofrenewable energy assets. It is holding talks with other tech companies that could result in deals similar to what it inked with Microsoft. For investors who are willing to invest in AI stocks, however, income-focused and risk-averse investments like NextEra and Brookfield Renewable may not be what you're after. If you prefer to lean into the \"next big thing,\" considerNuScale Power(SMR0.89%), which is working to build small modular reactors (SMRs). SMRs are basically a scaled-down version of anuclear power plantthat is built in a factory and can be placed right next to where power is needed, like for an AI data center. Right now, NuScale Power has partial agreements with several potential customers and is working to nail down its first customer. Once it has that deal, however, it is highly likely that additional customers will follow. And that could turn this money-losing upstart into a reliably profitable nuclear power stock. AI and data centers could be a very important end market. You can certainly attempt to pick the next big AI stock. And maybe you'll hit the jackpot. But Wall Street is littered with once-hot companies that didn't make it. The one thing that is very clear about AI, however, is that it needs power to \"live.\" And if you can switch gears just a little as an investor, there are plenty of ways to play AI with a pick-and-shovel approach. NextEra is a conservative and dividend-growth-focused option. Brookfield Renewable is a high-yield choice. And NuScale Power is a leading-edge nuclear power investment that will probably excite more aggressive investors. With AI businesses set to grow their electricity demand for at least a decade to come, each of these power-related investments has the AI wind at its back.",

        "content": "In 2023, Wall Street analyst Michael Hartnett fromBank of Americaassigned a nickname to a group of seven of America's largest technology stocks -- not just for their size, but also their ability to consistently beat theS&P 500(^GSPC-0.84%)index. He called this group the \"Magnificent Seven,\" and they have delivered a median return of 886% over the last 10 years, compared to a return of 185% for the S&P:  NVDAdata byYCharts In other words, investors who haven't owned the Magnificent Seven stocks over the last decade have probably underperformed the broader market by a very wide margin. But here's the good news: TheVanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF(MGK-0.81%)offers investors a simple way to buy them all, with a splash of diversification. It's anexchange-traded fund(ETF) that invests exclusively in America's largest companies, and the Magnificent Seven account for over half of the total value of its entire portfolio. Here's how the ETF could turn an investment of $200,000 into $1 million over the next 15 years (or less). Image source: Getty Images. The Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF tracks the CRSP U.S. Mega Cap Growth Index, which invests in the top 70% of the cumulativemarket capitalizationof the CRSP U.S. Total Market Index. The CRSP U.S. Total Market Index holds each of the 3,537 stocks listed on American exchanges. The U.S. Mega Cap Growth Index (and by extension, the Vanguard ETF) only holds 69 stocks, which highlights the incredible concentration of wealth in corporate America. To put it another way, just 69 companies represent 70% of the entire value of the 3,537 companies listed on American stock exchanges. It isn't entirely surprising considering theMagnificent Sevenstocks have a combined market capitalization of $17 trillion, which they have accumulated by dominating various subsegments of the technology industry including cloud computing, semiconductors, e-commerce, social media, and electric vehicles. As a result, the Magnificent Seven stocks alone represent 56.3% of the total value of the Vanguard ETF's portfolio of 69 stocks: Stock Vanguard ETF Portfolio Weighting Microsoft(MSFT-0.03%) 13.08% Nvidia(NVDA-0.10%) 11.93% Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) 11.60% Amazon(AMZN0.62%) 7.35% Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) 4.35% Alphabet(GOOG0.03%)(GOOGL-0.46%) 4.15% Tesla(TSLA-0.04%) 3.85% Data source: Vanguard. Portfolio weightings are accurate as of May 31, 2025, and are subject to change. Each of the Magnificent Seven companies are now focused onartificial intelligence(AI), which could be their largest financial opportunity ever. Microsoft,Amazon, and Alphabet have created their own AI models and chatbots, but they also operate some of the world's best data centers, which they rent to other AI developers for profit. Even the smallest Magnificent Seven company, Tesla, is now a leading developer of AI-poweredautonomous driving software. But it's Nvidia that hasbecome the poster child for the AI revolutionthanks to its graphics processing units (GPUs) for the data center, which are the most powerful chips for developing AI models. As I mentioned earlier, the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF gives investors an opportunity to own the Magnificent Seven stocks in a more diversified manner than buying them outright. Within its top 20 holdings, investors will find several popular non-technology stocks likeVisa,Eli Lilly,Costco Wholesale,McDonald's, andIntuit. The Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF has delivered a compound annual return of 13% since it was established in 2007, beating theS&P 500which has generated an average annual gain of 10.1% over the same period. A 13% annual return would be enough to turn an investment of $200,000 into $1 million within around 13 years and three months. In fact, the ETF could still deliver a fivefold return within 15 years even if its annual return slowed to 11.3%. However, returns appear to beacceleratinginstead. The ETF has delivered an annual gain of 16.1% over the last 10 years, a 17.8% annual gain over the last five years, and a 20.7% annual gain over the last three years. The surging dominance of the Magnificent Seven stocks and their peers across the tech and tech-adjacent industries are the main drivers of those increased returns. I'm not suggesting they will remain at those elevated levels over the long run, butAIcould certainly help the Vanguard ETF maintain its above-average performances for the next few years at least. Global consulting firm PwC predicts AI will add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030, and a lot of that value will be driven by the tech giants in this ETF. Nevertheless, it's never a good idea to put all of your eggs in one basket. This Vanguard ETF is a great buy primarily for investors with a diversified portfolio that has little or no exposure to the Magnificent Seven stocks already.",

        "content": "If you're investing in artificial intelligence (AI) stocks, chances are you've seen some mention ofSuper Micro Computer(SMCI-0.30%)andSoundHound AI(SOUN0.32%). While these aren't the biggest players in AI, they are among the most intriguing. The two companies face challenges, but they also possess a lot of possible upside. Super Micro Computer, which is better known as Supermicro, is involved in providing businesses with AI infrastructure, data servers, and the necessary hardware they need to ramp up their AI investments and projects. Although it's up more than 40% this year (as of June 13), its low valuation suggests that it still struggles to win back the trust of investors after having a very publicfalling out with its auditor last year. SoundHound AI rose to prominence last year after chipmakerNvidiadisclosed a position in the voice AI company. But with Nvidiarecently selling its stake in the businessand SoundHound still struggling to stay out of the red, many investors have also hit sell on this once-exiting AI stock. Which of these two stocks makes for the better option for investors looking to generate big gains from AI? Let's break down their numbers and growth opportunities to see which one is the best stock to put into your portfolio today. Image source: Getty Images. Supermicro provides valuable AI infrastructure that businesses need to scale their operations. It got into some trouble last year regarding its finances, including its financial auditor resigning. But the company has a new auditor and managed to meet its reporting deadlines to avoid its stock getting delisted. Over the trailing 12 months, the company generated $21.6 billion in sales, with its profits totaling $1.2 billion. Although its margins are lean, the company was able to consistently stay in the black and grow its earnings over the years. Investors discounted the stock heavily since the adversity and bad press it faced last year, and it now trades at just 13 times its expected future earnings (based on analyst estimates). This factors in the growth and earnings that analysts expect from the business in the year ahead, which suggests Supermicro could be a steal of a deal. Although it has been rallying this year, it's still nowhere near its 52-week high of $101.40 and could have more room to run higher. SoundHound AI is in a great position to benefit from companies seeking out voice AI capabilities. Whether it's to enhance a driving experience or help automate and expedite the ordering process at fast-food restaurants, it possesses many growth opportunities. Revenue in its most recent quarter, which ended on March 31, rose by 151% year over year to $29.1 million. The company got a boost from acquisitions, which have also diversified its customer base in the process. And although it remains unprofitable, its adjusted per-share loss shrank to $0.06 (compared with $0.07 in the prior-year period). SoundHound's business is smaller than Supermicro's, and that can work to its advantage, as its market cap is just around $4 billion (versus $26 billion for Supermicro). Given the potential it has to reach many industries and the rollout of Amelia 7.0, which is a \"full Agentic AI with category-leading voice technology,\" the company's valuation may rise significantly as it scales its operations, and since its growth is still in its very early innings. This year, the business expects to generate between $157 million to $177 million in sales, which will be a sizable increase from the $84.7 million it reported last year. If I were choosing between these twoAI stocksright now, I'd go with Supermicro. I don't love its thin margins, but the business has been able to stay in the black consistently, and its low valuation does offer a goodmargin of safety. Its operations appear to be more stable now, and there aren't huge question marks about its reporting hanging over the business. It may be overdue for an even greater rally. SoundHound AI is an intriguing business, and I could see it rising if it can generate good organic growth. But it's still a bit unproven, and with acquisitions muddying its recent results, it's hard to tell just how well the business is doing and if it can truly achieve profitability. SoundHound AI may have greater upside in the long run if it proves to be the real deal, but it's a far riskier option than Supermicro, which is why I'd go with the latter.",

        "header": "Should You Buy Nvidia Stock Now or Wait for a Dip?",
        "content": "Shares ofNvidia(NVDA-0.10%)have been fairly volatile this year. Trade-related concerns weighed down the stock a few months ago but those issues appear to be in the rearview mirror with the stock back to around its all-time highs. The company's cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) chips are crucial for many tech businesses deploying next-gen technologies and pursuing AI projects, and that has made it one of the best growth stocks to own in recent years. But with question marks still looming about what lies ahead for the global economy, is Nvidia's stock still a good buy at its current levels, or are you better off waiting for a drop in price before adding it to your portfolio? Image source: Getty Images. Nvidia is the leading AI chipmaker in the world. That has allowed it to command high margins for its products, which enabled it to grow its bottom line at an incredibly fast pace. While manygrowth stocksare able to grow their sales at impressive rates, what stands out about Nvidia is its earnings growth, which outpaced its top line in recent years.  NVDA Revenue (Quarterly)data byYCharts Arguably, the stock isn't even that expensive. While its market cap may be around $3.5 trillion, it still trades at a fairly modest forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 33 (based on analyst estimates). Although that's not exactly cheap, it's not that expensive either, given just how dominant the business is and how quickly it has been growing. The average stock on theS&P 500trades at 22.9 times its future earnings, and Nvidia surely doesn't fall into the category of \"average\" -- some premium is justifiable here. A risk for investors is that by waiting for a dip as Nvidia's earnings continue to grow, the stock may end up rising even if its P/E ratio doesn't increase. That's why it may not make sense to wait right now. The best argument for waiting is that with the S&P 500 back around record levels, there may be too much optimism and bullishness priced into the overall markets, and Nvidia is benefiting from that. The company still faces considerable uncertainty about trade restrictions involving one of its key markets, China. And it's not even going to include it in forecasts due to the uncertainty. Investors only need to look back to early April,when reciprocal tariffs were first announced, at how bearish the market can quickly turn amid such concerns. Back then, Nvidia's stock was trading at less than $100. Even if it's not China, there's growing concern about whether tech companies are spending too heavily on AI, and if a slowdown may be inevitable, as that too could weigh on Nvidia's growth prospects. The problem with Nvidia's valuation is it may look cheap, but only if its growth rate remains high. Any hint of a pullback could send the stock reeling again. In its most recent quarter, which ended on April 27, Nvidia's sales were up by an incredible 69%. If that growth rate were to fall below 30%, I don't think investors would be nearly as bullish about the stock as they are now. And based on Nvidia's high valuation, a best-case scenario still looks to be priced in. The year is not even six months old and there have already been some wild swings, from optimism to despair and back to euphoria. I don't doubt that there will be some bad news at some point in the future, likely relating to trade, that could send Nvidia's stock down again. But if you're a long-term investor, and you're planning to buy and hold Nvidia stock for years, then whether you buy it at $140 or $120 may not make a huge difference in the grand scheme of things. There's the possibility that a pullback in price may happen, but perhaps it's several months from now, after it has rallied to an even higher price point. Although theAI stockfell to below $100 earlier this year, that doesn't mean it'll do so again. Even if you're kicking yourself for missing the opportunity to buy it at those levels, you may still be better off simply buying Nvidia stock sooner rather than later. Otherwise, you may find yourself waiting for a decline that doesn't end up happening, or for the stock to fall to a price it won't reach again.",

        "content": "Broadcom(AVGO0.23%)isn't the first company that comes to investors' minds when discussing mission-critical suppliers to the AI arms race. Companies likeNvidiaandTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturingare often mentioned, but Broadcom hovers in the background. However, Broadcom is a formidable company primed to benefit from a massive boom from two of its AI products. Although Broadcom is a $1.2 trillion company right now, I could easily see it rising to a $2 trillion company within three years. That would easily allow it to outperform the market, which makes it a fantastic option to consider now. Image source: Getty Images. Broadcom isn't top of mind for many investors because it isn't laser-focused on AI. It has products sprawling from mainframe software to cybersecurity to virtual desktops (thanks to its VMware acquisition). However, many of Broadcom's AI products are critical to data center infrastructure. Broadcom's AI offerings are split into two categories: connectivity switches and custom AI accelerators, which it calls XPUs. Starting with the connectivity switches, data centers have computing clusters with thousands of GPUs that constantly process AI workloads. Often, an AI prompt may require multiple GPUs to process the answer, and data centers need devices to stitch together the multi-piece answer. That's where Broadcom's connectivity switches come in, and they will only become more important as we transition into the next phase of AI. Although all AI hyperscalers are working on training better models, we're starting to seewidespread usage of AI modelsin business and personal life. This means the AI hyperscalers must start thinking about inference, which occurs when an AI model is prompted for an answer. More inference capacity boosts the need for these connectivity switches, boosting Broadcom's sales. Another product that has Broadcom excited is its XPUs. Its custom AI accelerators are an alternative to GPUs, as they can also process multiple calculations in parallel. The difference between an XPU and a GPU is that XPUs are designed for a specific workload and don't have the flexibility of a GPU. Because these XPUs are designed in collaboration with the end user, the AI hyperscalers can tailor the processing unit to their workloads, optimizing these units for whatever workload they would like. This allows XPUs to outperform GPUs in specific use cases, but it also does something even more important for its clients. It cuts Nvidia out of the picture. It's no secret that the AI hyperscalers have a love-hate relationship with Nvidia, as Nvidia makes top-notch products but it charges an incredibly high premium for them. Nvidia's profit margin is over 50%, which is practically unheard of for a hardware company. So if clients can get the same performance out of their system without paying a significant chunk of money to fatten Nvidia's bottom line, they will do it. By purchasing XPUs, they only need to pay Broadcom a fraction of what they pay Nvidia, although Broadcom is still slated to make a ton of money from the design collaboration of these units. Broadcom's role in the AI world will only expand, but is this enough for its stock to nearly double in three years? In fiscal year 2024, Broadcom's total revenue was $51.6 billion. Of that, only $12.2 billion was AI-related revenue.  AVGO Revenue (TTM)data byYCharts However, Broadcom expects its AI-related revenue to rapidly ramp up over the next few years, reaching $60 billion to $90 billion by FY 2027. Broadcom confirmed these expectations by stating that its AI semiconductor growth rate during 2025 will extend into 2026, which tracks perfectly with the $60 billion to $90 billion in AI-related revenue for FY 2027. If you subtract 2024's AI-related revenue from its total, Broadcom's total was $39.4 billion. Even if its base business doesn't grow, if you add that figure to the bottom end of the AI revenue guidance, you'd get a company that generates around $100 billion in annual revenue. That's the absolute low side of the projection, which indicates that there is a margin of safety in this projection. With revenue likely more than doubling from now until 2027 (its trailing-12-month revenue total is $57 billion), I'm fairly confident that the stock will at least double from now until then. That will be enough to vault Broadcom into the $2 trillion valuation level, making the stock a successful investment.",

Datadog(DDOG1.00%)provides the critical observability tools that keep modern digital infrastructure running, and the AI boom is sharply accelerating demand. In Q1 2025, revenue jumped 25% year over year to $762 million, while adoption of the comany's large language model monitoring tools doubled in just six months. As AI workloads scale across industries, real-time infrastructure visibility becomes non-negotiable -- positioning Datadog as the backbone of the AI-powered enterprise stack. Despite the company's strong fundamentals, its shares are down more than 14% year to date (as of June 17, 2025), offering investors a rare entry point into a premier AI infrastructure play. Palantir Technologies(PLTR1.36%)has grown from a secretive defense contractor into a leading force in AI-powered analytics. In Q1 2025, revenue climbed 39% year over year to $884 million, driven by a 71% surge in U.S. commercial sales to $255 million and a 45% gain in government revenue to $373 million. By combining its Foundry and AIP platforms, Palantir delivers scalable AI solutions to both public institutions and private enterprises. This gives investors rare exposure to two of the most powerful adoption curves in the AI economy. Symbotic(SYM0.64%)is transforming the $35 billion warehouse automation market with AI-driven robotic systems. Q2 2025 revenue jumped 40% to $550 million, supported by a massive $23 billion contracted backlog. Walmarthas deployed Symbotic's technology across multiple distribution centers, proving the system can handle the world's most demanding logistics operations. As e-commerce volumes accelerate and labor shortages persist, major retailers are racing to automate their supply chains with AI-powered robotics. Symbotic is a key first mover in this rapidly expanding market. Navitas Semiconductor(NVTS2.19%)specializes in gallium nitride power semiconductors that enable faster, more efficient power conversion -- critical as AI data centers consume unprecedented amounts of energy. The company's GaN technology delivers up to 3x faster charging speeds while slashing energy consumption by 40%, making it essential infrastructure for the AI boom. Navitas recently secured a partnership withNvidiato develop power architecture for next-generation AI systems, validating its technology with the industry's most demanding customer. As data center construction accelerates and energy costs soar, Navitas is positioned to capture a significant share of the rapidly expanding power semiconductor market. Lemonade(LMND1.77%)is shaking up the $9 trillion insurance market with its AI-first approach. In Q1 2025, its in-force premiums surpassed $1 billion -- up 27% year over year to $1 billion -- with revenue rising 27% to $151.2 million. Its trailing-12-month gross loss ratio stands at 73%, a critical figure that has declined by an impressive 15 percentage points over the prior seven quarters. With its tech stack scaling into new lines and regions, Lemonade showcases that algorithmic efficiency can outpace legacy insurers at scale, making its stock a compelling buy for long-term thinkers. Tesla(TSLA-0.04%)is transforming from an automaker into an AI powerhouse across two massive markets: autonomous driving and humanoid robotics. The company plans to launch its robotaxi service in Austin on June 22, 2025, deploying driverless Model Y vehicles that navigate entirely through camera-based neural networks -- no human drivers needed. Moreover, Tesla's Optimus robots have entered production at the Fremont factory, with thousands expected by year-end to handle repetitive industrial tasks. With a $1 trillion valuation increasingly detached from car sales, Tesla is betting its future on AI-driven recurring revenue from robotaxis and robot workers that could dwarf its vehicle business. Advanced Micro Devices(AMD0.66%)is the only credible alternative to Nvidia in the AI accelerator market. At its June 12 \"Advancing AI\" event, AMD unveiled the Helios rack architecture launching in 2026, which integrates next-generation MI400 GPUs into unified AI servers. Theannouncementdrove the leading investment bank Piper Sandler to raise its price target on the stock to $140. AMD has thus emerged as the \"second horse\" that hyperscalers desperately need in a supply constrained market. As the AI infrastructure buildout accelerates toward a multitrillion-dollar scale, AMD's open-standards alternative to Nvidia looks increasingly vital, a fact that bodes well for its share-price performance in the years ahead.",

I've so far been very stubborn and just continued to DCA into AMD despite Nvidia performing so much better. I think I was just trying to root for the underdog and hope that AMD would catch up to Nvidia and then their stock would skyrocket. But it's pretty clear now that that isn't going to happen.

Nucor's steel mills had a higher average selling price in the second quarter, while its division selling steel products is projected to report higher profits \"due to a combination of stable overall pricing, higher volumes and lower average costs per ton.\" Nucor said it will release its second-quarter results after the bell on July 28, and hold an earnings call the next morning. Analysts havegrown more bullishon American steelmakers like Nucor this year, expecting the Trump administration'stariffs to raise pricesin the industry and lead to higher profits in the sector. Nucor shares were up more than 3% shortly after the opening bell, and entered the day up nearly 5% since the start of the year.",

        "content": "Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the10 best growth stocks to buy according to billionaires. Today, Nvidia\u2019s dominance in powering data centers and AI infrastructure is virtually uncontested. The demand for its GPUs not only boosted the growth of AI-driven applications but also led to tremendous growth for the company. In fiscal year 2021, the Gaming segment accounted for approximately 50% of total revenue. Over the next four years, the Data Center business surpassed it, accounting for around 89% of total revenue, while Gaming\u2019s contribution declined to around 9% by 2025. At its recently concluded GTC conference in Paris, the company highlighted its collaboration with European telecommunications companies, cloud service providers, and supercomputing centres in building AI infrastructure in the region. This accelerated investment by the EU is also expected to include building 20 AI Factories, among which 5 are Gigafactories. Therefore, Nvidia is expected to continue running at full speed. While the stock seems to be taking a breather in 2025 after the 170% surge in 2024, the majority of the street remains bullish, with the consensus 1-year median price target still indicating over 20% upside. Among the bullish voices is Oppenheimer analyst Rick Schafer, who on June 15, reiterated a Buy rating on Nvidia with an unchanged price target of $175. Before that, on June 12, DBS analyst Fang Boon Foo reiterated a Buy rating on Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) but revised the price target to $160 from $175. The analyst highlighted that Nvidia\u2019s recent partnership with Mistral AI, a French company, and its expansion plans in Europe support Nvidia\u2019s solid market position. Although he lowered the price target, the analyst still sees strong growth potential for Nvidia, and cited healthy demand, solid margins, and a strong capital spending cycle across major tech firms as key drivers for the stock\u2019s long-term performance. Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a leading innovator in the design and production of graphics processing units (GPUs), system-on-a-chip (SoC) solutions, and AI-driven hardware and software. The company\u2019s GPUs are used in gaming, high-performance computing, AI training, and inference and serve as the backbone of data center infrastructure worldwide. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

        "content": "Nvidia's(NVDA0.87%)stock price growth has slowed in 2025 (it's up only 8% so far), but it continues to beat the market, which is up only 2.1%. Earlier in the year, investors following Nvidia expressed concerns about multiple issues, including a new Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) model that worked using less-expensive (and fewer) chips to process its calculations, as well as changing regulatory policies that could curtail Nvidia's exports to China. Nvidia remains one of the hottest stocks on the market, and even though it's up roughly 1,470% over the past five years, it's not too late to buy. Here's why. Image source: Getty Images. Nvidia stock was a winner even before generative AI took off when ChatGPT launched at the end of 2022. It was already successful due to its high-powered graphics processing units (GPUs) that were needed for gaming as well as cryptocurrency mining, but it wasn't so well-known outside of those industries. It's now skyrocketing because generative AI needs powerful GPUs, too, and Nvidia is the leader. With nearly every large tech company in the race to release competitive AI platforms, Nvidia's business has been on fire. This growing demand is expected to continue, largely because Nvidia's products are capable and versatile. New opportunities continue to pop up in AI, including with data centers. These AI companies need tons of power for AI's computational needs, and they need data centers to manage that workload. Nvidia's revenue increased 69% year over year in the fiscal 2026 first quarter (ended April 27), and data center segment revenue outpaced it, increasing 73%. The data center opportunity will keep growing along with AI. According to Fortune Business Insights, the data center market was $243 billion in 2024, and it's expected to increase at acompound annual growth rate(CAGR) of 11.7% through 2032, reaching $585 billion. This is just the beginning for AI, and Nvidia is well-positioned to tap into that high growth.",

        "content": "Megacap technology companies have been some of the biggest movers and shakers in the stock market throughout 2025. Among the hottest stocks in the artificial intelligence (AI) realm isNvidia(NVDA0.87%), but it has been struggling this year. While the graphics processing unit (GPU) king's market capitalization peaked early this year at nearly $3.7 trillion, a months-long slide that bottomed out in April shaved about $1.4 trillion off its value. However, Nvidia stock has rebounded over the last month or so and has almost fully recovered from that decline. Let's explore what drove the sell-off in Nvidia to begin with. From there, I'll explain why investor enthusiasm for the chip designer is on the rise and detail why I think the stock is poised for an epic breakout during 2025's second half. The chart below illustrates the fluctuations in Nvidia's market cap throughout 2025. The volatility in the stock in January and February was triggered by the emergence onto the scene of Chinese AI start-upDeepSeek.  NVDA Market Capdata byYCharts. Initial reporting took DeepSeek management at its word when it asserted that it had developed its highly sophisticated R1 model at an incredibly low price relative to competing AI models, and had done so entirely with older Nvidia chip architectures that aren't widely used by U.S. developers anymore. This caused many onlookers to question just how essential Nvidia's most advanced GPUs would prove to be for AI development and training broadly, and whether demand for its new Blackwell series of chips would be as strong as had been projected. As more information about DeepSeek emerged, however, it became clear that the company may not have been entirely upfront abouthow it trained its model, or what the the real cost of doing so was. Investors came to recognize that the existence of DeepSeek might not represent a major threat to Nvidia's business after all. Yet its shares continued to slide. Why? Well, throughout the month of March, investors were more or less guessing whether President Donald Trump would, in fact, impose heavy tariffs on America's trading partners -- something he had often promised to do while campaigning. On April 2, Trump declared what he called \"Liberation Day,\" unveiling steep newtariffson goods imported from nearly every country in the world. His threatened tariffs on China, a market that Nvidia relies heavily on for growth, were particularly high. In the wake of that news, Nvidia sank to its 2025 low. Image source: Getty Images. As the stock chart above makes clear, investors appear to have hopped back onto the Nvidia train over the last several weeks. At a high level, one might suggest that developments in the trade negotiations between the U.S. and China may have eased investor tension. While I understand that idea in theory, I think there is more to the picture. Despite the positive rhetoric from the White House about the status of its talks with China, Nvidia's management recently notified investors that the company will beexcluding China from its financial guidancefor the time being. Instead, I see a couple of other reasons why investors may be piling back into the stock. You may recall that earlier this year, executives fromOracle, OpenAI, andSoftBankmet at the White House to announce a large-scale infrastructure initiative called theStargate Project. The members of the joint venture intend to make a collective investment of $500 billion over four years into U.S.-based data centers and various other infrastructure specifically designed to support AI. Nvidia was named as a key technology partner in the project, along withMicrosoft,Arm, Oracle, and OpenAI. Elsewhere, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have begun their own Stargate-like initiatives, in whichNvidia has already become involved. For most of its history, Nvidia has been known as a hardware business. What some investors may not realize, however, is that the company has been quietly diversifying its ecosystem for years. For example, Nvidia has developed a software platform calledCUDAthat allows developers to program its GPUs for the specific uses they require and get the most out of their parallel-processing power. This integrated system has helped Nvidia become an end-to-end service provider for AI developers, as it offers industry-leading hardwareandsoftware. In addition, Nvidia has made a number of investments in recent years -- particularly in AI infrastructure leadersCoreWeaveandNebius Group. I see these investments as highly strategic, as Nvidia is moving beyond designing hardware and software to become a critical player in AI data center construction, too. It has swiftly become a full-stack provider of AI services, making it harder for peers such asAdvanced Micro Devicesor custom silicon designers to catch up. Taking this one step further, Nvidia's management has suggested that the company might use some of its robust and rising earnings to make acquisitions. While this is speculative, I thinkif Nvidia does pursue acquisitions, these deals will be focused on emerging areas such as robotics or autonomous driving that Nvidia could penetrate to diversify its business beyond its GPU and data center operations. Current analyst sentiment surrounding Nvidia stock suggests that shares could be headed for a breakout. With a market cap of more than $3.5 trillion, Nvidia has been trading the title ofworld's most valuable companyback and forth withMicrosoftover the past month. The bigger idea I want to drive home is that the secular trends fueling AI infrastructure investment and Nvidia's ongoing efforts to expand beyond chip design are the core reasons I think the company will not only continue rising in value but actually sustain its lead over other megacap peers in the months ahead.",

        "content": "NVIDIAhas recently partnered with Trend Micro and Dell Technologies to provide AI-powered security solutions, which align well with the ongoing demand for advanced tech solutions in increasingly complex IT environments. This collaboration may have complemented NVIDIA's 22.63% price increase over the last quarter, alongside its strong earnings report showing a major sales surge. Concurrently, strategic alliances with Sofinnova Partners and Firebird underline NVIDIA\u2019s push into diverse sectors, strengthening its position in the AI and computing space. The company\u2019s strategically-timed dividends and planned investment in PsiQuantum may have further added momentum to the stock's upward trajectory. Be aware that NVIDIA is showing 1 weakness in our investment analysis. These 16 companies survived and thrived after COVID and have the right ingredients to survive Trump's tariffs. Discover why before your portfolio feels the trade war pinch. The recent collaboration between NVIDIA, Trend Micro, and Dell Technologies is poised to enhance NVIDIA's AI-powered security offerings, potentially boosting future revenue streams. This partnership aligns with NVIDIA's expanding presence in advanced technology sectors, reinforcing its position in AI and computing. Considering NVIDIA's alliances with companies like Toyota and Uber to expand its AI footprint in the automotive sector, the company's ongoing partnerships suggest a multifaceted approach to capturing new markets and solidifying existing ones. Over the past five years, NVIDIA's total shareholder return has been very large at 1430.11%, reflecting substantial long-term growth. However, when compared to the US market over the last year, NVIDIA underperformed, despite a shorter-term uptick in its stock price. This underperformance is part of the broader context involving industry trends and market conditions. The recent partnership and product innovations suggest a positive impact on NVIDIA's revenue and earnings forecasts. Analysts expect significant revenue expansions, driven by NVIDIA's focus on AI models and its Blackwell architecture, which are anticipated to bolster its data center revenues and enhance its margins. However, regulatory challenges and potential export limitations could hinder geographic diversification efforts and stability in revenue streams. The recent 22.63% share price increase highlights positive sentiment and aligns with a strategic shift in business focus. With a current share price of US$113.54, NVIDIA is priced below the consensus analyst target of US$163.12, indicating room for upward movement if future expectations materialize as analysts predict. This potential for growth, combined with operational efficiency in ramping production, positions NVIDIA as a competitive player in evolving tech markets.

Over the last quarter, the company's stock price increased by 9%. This aligns closely with broader market trends, as both Texas Instruments and market indices have posted similar gains. This expansion and strategic collaborations could have added upward momentum in line with broader sector movements. The company's performance during such economic conditions underscored its resilience and potential for future growth. Be aware that Texas Instruments is showing 2 weaknesses in our investment analysis and 1 of those is a bit concerning. We've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free. The recent announcement of Texas Instruments' US$60 billion investment to build semiconductor fabs in the U.S. alongside collaborations with industry leaders such as Ford, Medtronic, and NVIDIA could potentially bolster its revenue and earnings forecasts. Such investments are likely to enhance production capabilities and fortify the company's market position amidst recovering industrial and automotive demand. This strategic move may also catalyze revenue growth, though the pressure from geopolitical challenges and tariffs remains a risk to margins and profitability. Over a five-year period, Texas Instruments' total shareholder return, including dividends, was 79.59%. This significant growth reflects the company's capacity to generate value, though it underperformed the U.S. market, which experienced a 9.8% return over the past year. Relative to the semiconductor industry, Texas Instruments' performance aligned more closely, reflecting a movement consistent with its peers in the previous year. The current share price movement, reflecting a 9% increase over the last quarter, suggests positive market sentiment related to the company's expansion plans. However, the share price remains at a discount to the consensus analyst price target of US$180.76, with a noted share price discount of around 8.6%.

        "content": "Micron Technology, Inc.MUstock has\u00a0soared 90% since early April and 45% in 2025, retaking critical technical levels in the process. Despite the rally, the semiconductor stock trades 20% below its June 2024 highs because its earnings outlook faded within the historically cyclical memory segment. Now looks like a wonderful opportunity to buy Micron for long-term artificial intelligence upside before its Q3 FY25 release on June 25. Micron is a compelling long-term AI investment because it is a leader in high-bandwidth memory chips that are critical\u00a0for AI workloads. MU works directly with AI chip powerhouse Nvidia and its closest rival, AMD. Micron\u2019s earnings and revenue growth outlook is staggering in FY25 and FY26. It also trades at a huge discount to Tech, though its stock has outpaced the sector for the last 20 years. Micron makes DRAM and NAND memory and storage chips that are critical components within devices from smartphones to AI data centers. Its growth and innovations in a key segment of the semiconductor industry helped MU stock climb roughly 1,100% in the past 20 years to crush the Zacks Tech sector\u2019s 770%. The company works closely with Nvidia, and it is expanding its manufacturing footprint in the U.S. as part of the larger reshoring boom. Micron is a vertically integrated semiconductor company. This means it designs, manufactures, and tests most of its chips in-house, unlike fabless companies such as Nvidia that outsource manufacturing to foundries like TSMC. Speaking of, Micron announced on June 12 that it is expanding its U.S. investments to $200 billion, including $150 billion for memory chip manufacturing and $50 billion for R&D, to boost domestic semiconductor production. Micron, boosted by help from the U.S. government, aims to produce 40% of its DRAM in the U.S. On top of that, the \u201cco-location of these two Idaho fabs with Micron\u2019s Idaho R&D operations will drive economies of scale and faster time to market for leading-edge products.\u201d Image Source: Zacks Investment Research MU\u2019s memory segment has been one of the most boom-and-bust parts of the historically cyclical semiconductor industry. Micron\u2019s revenue has fluctuated alongside consumer spending and production cycles across smartphones, PCs, laptops, vehicles, and more. The rise of data centers and, most recently, artificial intelligence, could see Micron become a bit more decoupled from those business cycles. The company\u2019s advanced high-bandwidth memory (HBM) technologies are critical to AI because they provide the high bandwidth and large memory capacity needed to quickly move massive data sets for training and running complex AI models. Micron\u2019s HBMs are energy-efficient, with a stacked design that reduces latency and power consumption, enabling faster and more efficient AI computations in data centers. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Micron has predicted AI will drive record memory chip demand. MU is also a key supplier of memory chips for Nvidia\u2019sNVDAindustry-leading AI processors. The company works with the second biggest player in the AI chip space, AMDAMDas well. It announced on June 12 that its HBM has been designed into a \u201cleading AMD AI platform.\u201d MU said its \u201cdata center DRAM revenue reached a new record\u201d in Q2 FY25, with HBM sales up more than 50% sequentially to over $1 billion for the first time. Management confirmed that HBM chip shipments are on track to ramp significantly in the second half of 2025, positioning Micron as a key beneficiary of surging AI-related infrastructure spending. MU is projected to grow its revenue by 41% in FY25 and 31% in FY26 to hit $46 billion, adding $20 billion to the top line between its FY24 and FY26. The run would see it break out firmly above its previous all-time highs of roughly $30 billion, which it hit in FY18 and FY22. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Micron\u2019s adjusted earnings are expected to skyrocket by 433% in FY25 and another 56% next year, from $1.30 in FY24 to $10.80 in FY26. Booming demand for its AI-focused HBM chips is helping drive its massive EPS growth. MU\u2019s EPS outlook remains below where it was a year ago. But its FY25 consensus estimate is up slightly since its last earnings release, and Micron has beaten EPS estimates in 18 out of the past 20 quarters. MU stock has climbed roughly 1,100% in the past 20 years to crush the Zacks Tech sector\u2019s 770%, and it's almost doubled Tech in the last 15 years. The chip memory chip maker\u2019s outperformance continued in the past five years as well, with it up 141% vs. Tech\u2019s 115%. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Yet, Micron is down 20% from its late June 2024 peaks while Tech floats right near its records. MU is still trading well below its all-time highs, even though the stock has\u00a0soared 90% since early April and 45% in 2025, blowing away Nvidia and AMD. MU rallied after it found support at its pre-COVID, early 2020 highs (and its 2018 heights) and its long-term 50-month moving average. The stock is currently attempting to break above its gap lower from last July. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research On the valuation front, Micron trades at a 50% discount to Tech and near its 10-year median at 12.5X forward earnings. Factoring in its stellar earnings growth outlook via its PEG ratio, MU trades at 0.2 vs. Tech\u2019s 1.7. Micron also pays dividends, and its balance sheet is robust. All in, it might be time to buy the memory chip stock for long-term AI growth and beyond. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Major U.S. equities indexes finished Wednesday little changed as the Federal Reserve announced that it would keep interest ratesat current levels. Although the central bank raised its inflation forecast, reduced its economic growth outlook, and suggested that is in no hurry to reduce interest rates, the \"dot plot\" indicated that Fed policymakers still expect two rate cuts this year, in line with previous forecasts. After trading in positive territory for much of the day, the S&P 500 lost ground during Fed Chair Jerome Powell's afternoon press conference, ending with a loss of less than 0.1%. The Dow was down 0.1%, while the Nasdaq eked out a gain of 0.1%. (ReadInvestopedia'sfull coverage oftoday's trading here.) Stock and bond marketsare closed Thursdayfor the Juneteenth holiday. Shares of Coinbase Global (COIN), operator of the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, soared 16%, notching the S&P 500'stop daily performance. The surge for the stock came a day after theSenate passed the GENIUS Act, providing a regulatory framework for companies issuingstablecoins. The legislation wouldrequire stablecoin creatorsto hold dollars, Treasury securities, or other assets considered safe with a value equivalent to the coins they've issued, providing a guardrail against the collapse of the digital assets. TKO Group Holdings (TKO) shares rose 4.8% after several investment research firmsexpressed positive viewson the Ultimate Fighting Championship and World Wrestling Entertainment parent. Citi analysts lifted their price target on the sports and entertainment company's stock, noting an upbeat outlook for TKO's media rights renewal process. Analysts at Bernstein agreed, predicting that UFC broadcasting rights would continue to grow in value and saying that TKO's moves to \"festivilize\" its live events could drive other growth opportunities related. Shares of solar microinverter manufacturer Enphase Energy (ENPH) bounced 4.2%, clawing back a portion of the heavy losses posted in the previous session after the Senate's proposed reconciliation bill included cuts to key clean-energy tax credits. Enphase has been seeing some success in some European markets with the launch of its latest home battery solution. The crypto-friendly legislation that passed the Senate pressured shares of credit card companies. The stablecoin rules laid out in the bill could provide merchants with a path for bypassing card-based payment systems. Mastercard (MA) shares dropped 5.4%, losing the most of any S&P 500 stock on Wednesday, while shares of rival card giant Visa (V) were down 4.9%. Beyond the major credit card names, the potential for stablecoin-driven disruptions to the payment ecosystem also weighed on payment processors' stocks. Shares of business payments specialist Corpay (CPAY) sank 4%, while shares of payroll technology firm Paycom Software (PAYC) were down 3.7%. Shares of Zoetis (ZTS), a provider of veterinary medicines and other animal health products, slipped 4.1% after Stifel downgraded the stock to \"hold\" from \"buy.\" Analysts pointed to slowing growth in the company's key dermatology and parasiticide segments, noting that increasing competition across numerous product categories could make it difficult for Zoetis to match revenue growth expectations over the coming years.",

        "content": "Texas Instruments (TXN) said Wednesday it plans to invest over $60 billion in U.S. chip production, making it the latest chipmaker to announce funds earmarked for U.S. facilities as President Donald Trump urges firms to commit to American manufacturing. The investment, which Texas Instruments called \u201cthe largest investment in foundational semiconductor manufacturing in U.S. history,\u201d includes seven facilities at sites in Texas and Utah. The company said it expects the move to create 60,000 jobs. Texas Instruments did not offer a specific time frame for the investment, but said work is already underway on two facilities at its Sherman, Texas mega-site. Foundational semiconductors are used in a wide variety of electronic devices, including smartphones, vehicles, and satellites. Texas Instruments said it counts Apple (AAPL), Ford (F), Nvidia (NVDA), SpaceX, and Medtronic (MDT) among those using its products. Texas Instruments also said it is \u201cworking with the Trump administration\u201d to expand its U.S. manufacturing capacity, echoing a string of other tech firms this year in nodding to the White House while announcing domestic manufacturing initiatives. Last week, Micron Technology (MU) said it expects to spend$200 billionin memory manufacturing and research and development.\u00a0U.S. manufacturing announcements have also come fromNvidia,TSMC(TSM), andInternational Business Machines(IBM) this year. Apple, which the president hasthreatened with tariffson iPhones sold in the U.S. made in other countries, earlier this year said it would invest$500 billionin AI server production facilities in America.

        "content": "U.S. Steel has been acquired. That raises the inevitable question: Who gets the X?

Will someone claim the X? The NYSE declined to comment on the specific case, but it\u00a0requires a formal request, made through its website, along with \u201ca reasonable basis to believe that the symbol will be used within 24 months.\u201dTickers that return to exchanges undergo a \u201ccooling off\u201d period of at least 90 days to avoid potential confusion.

The layoffs are expected to be announced early next month,Bloombergreported Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter.Microsoft did not immediately respond toInvestopedia'srequest for comment. The news comes about a month after reports of a 3% cut to Microsoft's global workforce, or over 6,000 roles, in the largest layoff sinceMicrosoft cut 10,000 jobsin 2023.

        "header": "Prediction: This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Could Be the Biggest Winner of the Second Half of 2025",
        "content": "As of June 12, shares of electric vehicle (EV) manufacturerTesla(TSLA1.80%)have dropped by 21% on the year. On the surface, this doesn't exactly inspire confidence. However, over the last couple of weeks, Tesla stock has started to witness some new life -- save for a brief sell-off following a fleeting tiff between Elon Musk and President Trump. While Tesla's core EV business continues to struggle, I think shares are poised for an epic comeback during the second half of the year. Let's explore a major update coming to Tesla soon and understand how this could fuel shares to new all-time highs. Is now the time to pounce on Tesla stock? Read on to find out. Tesla investors understand that Elon Musk's vision for the company is not just to sell the most EVs. Rather, Musk has been focusing on various elements of artificial intelligence (AI) and how the technology can be used to transform Tesla. Right now, the most immediate AI use case for Tesla is commercializing autonomous driving software. Tesla plans to leverage self-driving software across two applications: offering it as a feature in its cars and building a fleet of robotaxis for ride-hailing services. While the initial launch date for the Tesla Robotaxi was rumored to be June 12, more recent commentary from Musk himself suggests that the first rides will take place in Austin, Texas, later this month (potentially between June 22 and 28). A successful robotaxi launch represents a transformative shift in Tesla -- from primarily a car manufacturer to more of an AI-powered services provider disrupting ride-hailing, car rentals, or logistics businesses. Image source: Getty Images. When it comes to popular stocks in the AI realm, I'm sure cloud hyperscalersMicrosoft,Alphabet, andAmazoncome to mind. Moreover, givenNvidia's ongoing rollout of its new Blackwell GPU architecture, the semiconductor king appears well positioned for further growth, too. Among Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon, these three cloud computing giants are forecast to spend nearly $260 billion in AIcapital expenditures(capex) just this year. On the one hand, these companies would not be investing so aggressively if demand was not robust for their respective AI services. But on the other side of the equation, it takes time to build out AI data centers and complete sophisticated AI infrastructure projects. In my view, investors might want to see some tangible return on investment in the form of accelerating revenue and widening profit margins from this rising capex before doubling down on their positions. In addition, the biggest question mark surrounding Nvidia is the company'sexposure to Chinaand how ongoing tariff negotiations could impact the company's market presence across Asia. Although Tesla is not completely immune to tariffs and its core EV business is decelerating, recent price action suggests that investors view these road bumps as near-term headwinds. The primary catalyst fueling Tesla stock right now seems to be the robotaxi launch. Wide-scale adoption of autonomous driving technology could be a game changer for Tesla. At its core, the company's self-driving technology is a software product -- meaning it carries higher profit margins than the traditional automobile business. Moreover, both the robotaxi service and the autonomous driving feature have the potential to be sources of more recurring revenue for Tesla -- as opposed to a one-time purchase of a vehicle. In turn, longtime Tesla investorRon Baronforecasts that autonomous driving services could add billions in annual cash flow to Tesla.Ark Invest CEO Cathie Woodand equity research analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities are in the same boat as Baron, going as far as to project that the robotaxi could be Tesla's path toachieving trillions in additional value for shareholders. Although Tesla stock has steadily been climbing over the last month-and-a-half, I would caution investors from buying into the idea that now is an opportunity to take advantage of a dip.  TSLAdata byYCharts Right now, I think Tesla stock is largely trading on a bullish narrative surrounding the launch of the robotaxi. I'd go as far as to say that as the launch gets underway and Tesla begins to scale the robotaxi operation, shares could begin to rise sharply. However, smart investors remember that Musk himself has made it explicitly clear that therobotaxi will not be a meaningful financial contributor for Teslafor at least a year. Even if Tesla stock soars during the second half of 2025, I think it will be largely driven by momentum and excitement. In my view, that style of price movement is aligned withswing tradingas opposed to long-term investing. So, while I do think Tesla stock will outperform its \"Magnificent Seven\" peers over the next six months, I actually think investing in the stock is a bit risky at the moment. A more prudent approach to an investment in Tesla is to see how the Robotaxi business scalers in the coming months while learning how impactful this new segment is for the entire business. From there, investors should get a better sense of what the robotaxi could actually be worth to help assess if Tesla's valuation is reasonable.",
