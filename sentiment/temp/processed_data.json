On Tuesday, Wells Fargo lifted itsprice targeton the stock, citing the company's early AI lead and strong incumbent position in a tight market. Analysts at Wedbush on Wednesday also raised their price target, noting that the tech giant stands to benefit from a massive adoption wave of Copilot and Azure monetization as enterprise clients deploy AI tools, Thebullish commentarycomes after a report surfaced last week that the Windows maker is planning tocut thousands of jobsas it looks to reduce labor costs while increasing its AI spending. Microsoft shares have gained 18% since the start of the year, making the stock the second-best performer in theMagnificent 7, behind only Facebook and Instagram parent Meta Platforms (META). Microsoft gained 1.1% on Thursday to close at $497.45. Below, we break down thetechnicalson Microsoft\u2019s chart and point out key levels worth watching out for. After closing above the 50- and 200-day moving averages last month, Microsoft shares have traded higher within a narrowascending channelon low volatility. The move has coincided with therelative strength indexremaining mostly above the indicator\u2019s 70 threshold, signaling strong momentum. In another sign that the bulls remain in control of theprice action, the 50-day MA crossed above the 200-day MA earlier this month to generate agolden crosspattern.

Investors can use the measured move technique, also known by chart watchers as themeasuring principle, to project a potentialupsidetarget in the stock. When applying the analysis to Microsoft\u2019s chart, we calculate the distance of the ascending channel from its low to high and add that amount to the pattern\u2019s top trendline. This projects a target of $565 ($70 + $495). The first level to watch sits around $468.

The company, which is working on a turnaround under CEO Elliott Hill, said itexpects to take a $1 billion hit from the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs if left at current levels, but intends to mitigate their impact over time by reducing its reliance on production in China, implementing price increases in the U.S., and reining in corporate costs. Going into the earnings report, Nike shares had recovered 20% from their April low but remained 17% loweryear to dateamid concerns over significant exposure to a supply chain in China and the company\u2019s slower-than-expected recovery effort.\u00a0The stock jumped 11% to around $69 in Thursday's after-hours session.

This level also corresponds with the 61.8%Fibonacci retracement levelwhen applying a grid from the stock\u2019s February high to April low. A decisive close above this level could see the shares climb toward $79. The stock may encounter selling pressure in this location near the high of last June\u2019s notablestock gap, which also closely aligns with severalpeaks and troughsthat formed between September and February.

Bitcoin'sriding high. Nvidia's (NVDA) market cap is $3.8 trillion. Imminent or at least soonish rate cutsare back on the table. And the S&P 500 (^GSPC) is flirting witha new closing recordamidtech optimism. Stripped of context and isolated from worrisome headlines, you'd think the market wasoperating in a different time period. But here we are. The news environment and political moment matter, of course, as this latest bout of unleashed animal spirits is a reaction to shrinking negative catalysts and the dissolving of some of the most troublesome uncertainties. The current pivot back to 2024 market narratives has been a sharp one, and the week's Fed drama was bolstered by a pair of readings Thursday: A weaker first quarterGDP estimatethan was previously reported and fresh labor data bolstered the case that it's getting tougher for people out of a job to find work. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo'sTermsandPrivacy Policy The updates appeared to convince more investors that the Fed will speed up rate-cutting plans to address deteriorating economic conditions. Market bets are welcoming the \"bad news\" with open arms because it means there's a chance the first rate cut could arrive as soon as July, and if not, almost certainly by September, and because that \"bad news\" comes as the unemployment rate is still \u2014 as Powell is wont to remind the public \u2014 at a historically low 4.2%. The dovish turn coincides with a sentiment shift that the tariff impact will bemore muted than originally thought. And market optimism has been jolted as Wall Street interpretsthe hostilitiesbetween the US and Iran as on a path to deescalation. \"The stock market is back at record highs as various uncertainties start to fade,\" said Paul Stanley, chief investment officer at Granite Bay Wealth Management, in a note Thursday. \"The market is betting on continued progress on trade and a de-escalation of tensions in the Middle East is giving investors confidence.\" But as Stanley and others point out, even as the market reaches for new highs, it's unclear what the next major catalyst could be with last quarter's major obstacles out of the way. If so much of the positive momentum flowed from the collapse of worst-case scenarios, focus now goes to the positive ones. And there certainly are plenty to count. Fed cut speculation could turn into an actual Fed cut \u2014 or Fedcuts.The Magnificent Seven could get their mojo back and turn around a rough year. More trade deals could emerge instead of trade war pauses. That's one way to look at it. But things can obviously keep trucking along even when the drama dies down. Conditions have been so volatile that it's easy to forget earnings growth and the AI story were more than enough to power the market for a good while. When volatility drops, the market's rise almost seems gravitational. With a clearer playing field, what's to stop that from happening again?

        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) stock keeps climbing as the artificial intelligence (AI) trade accelerates. Dan Ives, Wedbush Securities managing director and global head of technology research, joins Market Catalysts to explain why he sees Nvidia hitting a $5 trillion market cap and why Palantir (PLTR) could follow with a $1 trillion valuation. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Catalystshere. Dan, great to have you on the program with us. We saw strong third quarter results from Micron boosted by AI demand, so how does this factor into the broader AI trade and add just another thought in the frame of mind for some of the Nvidia investors out there as well? I mean, there's one chip fueling the AI revolution and that's Nvidia. And I think investors are starting to recognize we haven't even seen the biggest growth driver yet of AI. Not not just an enterprise and the use cases, but on the consumer side, ultimately autonomous and robotics. And I just, this is, in my view, it's not just four trillion, I mean, we're going to be looking at five trillion dollar market cap in Nvidia. And so at what point, what's the kind of modeling in the time frame that you're kind of anticipating that that could come to fruition? Street's still underestimating growth longer term. I think by 15 to 20%, that could be conservative. I think when you actually see the dynamics playing out today, remember they took China basically out of their forecast. And if you have any trade deal, a big chip on the table is Nvidia and I believe they're not going to hand that business on a silver platter to Huawei. I think right now investors are starting to recognize the growth opportunities for Nvidia and we've talked about demand to supply, 10 to one. And so as we're thinking about that and you mentioned China, one of the major factors within any type of trade deal is going to be IP, that intellectual property. What is the likelihood that we see an outcome on the intellectual property front that is favorable for Nvidia and what does that do in terms of unlocking some of that addressable market? I think probably less for Nvidia from an IP perspective. And the bigger issue from an IP especially a lot of the software players, that's been the big issue when it comes to China. But look, there's a give and take here. And the reality is that Jensen wants that business back, he's talked about it. And you know, when you think about it, eight billion a quarter, but eventually that could be 10, 12 billion a quarter. But China, they know that there's only one chip in the world fueling AI revolution. That's the Godfather of AI, Jensen Nvidia. You know, we've heard, we've heard some really strong calls for even six trillion dollar market caps for Nvidia here. What is you think the the critical kind of checklist in order for us to get to that point? I think checklist is, and just take all the geopolitical out for a second, but I think first, it's the use cases that are now exploding. And we're seeing on the hyperscale and Microsoft, of course names like Palantir which continues to be one of our top names. Then it's the consumer piece, you know, everything Zuckerberg and Met is doing and what we're seeing with Alpha and others, because that's a whole another leg to the stool in terms of the consumer side. And then the Holy Grail, autonomous robotics, humanoids, that's not even being factored in here today. And so you mentioned a few of the other things that I wanted to get to as well here. You of course are tracking Palantir and another name that's seen new record highs. What do you think is really contributing to the mindset around the trading and the thesis for Palantir right now? Look, I mean, they hated at 20, despised at 70, called expensive at 100, right? I mean, now the bear is 145 because as we always say, they they can't find AI and spreadsheets when they're in hibernation mode. Palantir we view as a trillion dollar market cap in the next two or three years. There is no company from a software perspective that has what they have. And I think now as they go further and further after the enterprise, as sovereigns go down the AI path, this is just the beginning of what's going to be a golden age of Palantir. And I think, look, is it expensive today? Of course, but if you look out two, three, four years, I mean, we're going to be talking about one of most transformational companies in the world.",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) \u2014 Two years after Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) made history by becoming the first chipmaker to achieve a $1 trillion market capitalization, an even more remarkable milestone is within its grasp: becoming the first company to reach $4 trillion. Most Read from Bloomberg Philadelphia Transit System Votes to Cut Service by 45%, Hike Fares US Renters Face Storm of Rising Costs Squeezed by Crowds, the Roads of Central Park Are Being Reimagined Mapping the Architectural History of New York\u2019s Chinatown US State Budget Wounds Intensify From Trump, DOGE Policy Shifts After the emergence of China\u2019s DeepSeek sent the stock plunging earlier this year and stoked concerns that outlays on artificial intelligence infrastructure were set to slow, Nvidia shares have rallied back to a record. Its biggest customers remain full steam ahead on spending, much of which is flowing to its computing systems. A 64% gain from an April low has pushed its market capitalization to $3.78 trillion, overtaking Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) at $3.70 trillion to again become the world\u2019s most valuable company. With a broadening customer base clamoring for Nvidia\u2019s latest AI accelerators and competitors still distant, bulls are betting the chipmaker\u2019s shares have plenty of room to run. \u201cWe believe that Nvidia is truly uniquely positioned, and that it will sustain its position over the next decade-plus,\u201d said Aziz Hamzaogullari, chief investment officer at Loomis, Sayles & Co. and founder of the firm\u2019s growth equity strategies team. Hamzaogullari isn\u2019t alone. This week, Loop Capital analyst Ananda Baruah raised Nvidia\u2019s price target to $250 from $175, a level that would equate to a roughly $6 trillion market value. Baruah, who has a buy rating on the stock, expects annual AI spending from various types of customers to rise to nearly $2 trillion by 2028. \u201cWhile it may seem fantastic that Nvidia fundamentals can continue to amplify from current levels, we remind folks that Nvidia remains essentially a monopoly for critical tech, and that it has pricing (and margin) power,\u201d Baruah wrote in a research note on June 25, referring to Nvidia by its ticker symbol. The bullish sentiment behind Nvidia and other makers of AI gear is a stark reversal from earlier in the year when the emergence of advanced chatbots like DeepSeek, developed relatively cheaply in China, sparked fears that Nvidia\u2019s customers would cut spending. Instead, US tech giants are plowing even more money into computing infrastructure. Microsoft, Meta (META), Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) and Alphabet Inc. (GOOG,GOOGL) are projected to put about $350 billion into capital expenditures in their upcoming fiscal years, up from $310 billion in the current year, according to the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Those companies account for more than 40% of Nvidia\u2019s revenue. Of course, there are still plenty of risks that could derail Nvidia\u2019s rally. The company relies on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM,2330.TW) for the production of its chips, exposing Nvidia to US President Donald Trump\u2019s trade policies, which can change on a whim. Trump\u2019s 90-day pause on the stiffest tariffs is set to end on July 9. At the same time, there\u2019s no guarantee Nvidia\u2019s biggest customers won\u2019t change their tune on spending in coming years. Many of them are developing their own chips to avoid the steep prices commanded by Nvidia. \u201cThe valuation depends on the persistence of growth, and we already know that Nvidia\u2019s largest customers are trying to figure out ways to be more efficient with their spending, not just with Nvidia, but also offloading to their own silicon,\u201d said Dan Davidowitz, chief investment officer at Polen Capital Management. \u201cYou have to have very robust assumptions to get comfortable with the valuation, and we just don\u2019t have a good enough view on what that demand looks like.\u201d Nvidia shares are priced at 32 times earnings projected over the next 12 months, compared with 22 times for the S&P 500. The stock\u2019s valuation doesn\u2019t bother Loomis Sayles\u2019s Hamzaogullari, who remains a firm believer that AI will transform society and is convinced that Nvidia will remain a key winner as productivity gains from the technology expand. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean it will be steady Eddie all the time, that there won\u2019t be disruptions in spending, but this is a secular structural change, and Nvidia remains one of the biggest beneficiaries,\u201d Hamzaogullari said. \u201cThe stock still looks attractive given that backdrop.\u201d Top Tech News Masayoshi Son acknowledged the outlines of a succession plan, addressing what may be the single biggest concern among investors, and name-checked the head of SoftBank Group Corp.\u2019s telecom unit Junichi Miyakawa. House Republicans aim to get the Senate\u2019s landmark stablecoin legislation \u2014 known as the Genius Act \u2014 to President Donald Trump\u2019s desk for signature as soon as the week of July 7, according to people with direct knowledge of the strategy. Apple and Google\u2019s Android have been warned by a top German privacy regulator that the Chinese AI service DeepSeek, available on their app stores, constitutes illegal content because it exposes users\u2019 data to Chinese authorities. The US will need more nuclear power as it enters into greater competition with China, said Mike Gallagher, head of defense at Palantir Technologies Inc. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. elevated e-commerce head Jiang Fan while trimming the members of a longstanding leadership body, as the Chinese tech giant pivots toward AI and overseas expansion.

        "content": "The stock market has been a bumpy ride in 2025. TheS&P 500(^GSPC0.80%)rose 4% in the first two months before taking a 19% dive in the next six weeks. The index has recovered from that plunge and trades just above the year-end level again, but it has been an adventure to remember. With volatility like this, it's no wonder many investors are staying away from the \"buy\" button. But there are some great buys available, even in the extra-volatile tech sector. If you have $5,000 to invest right now, this could be a great time to buy someNetflix(NFLX2.45%)orAdvanced Micro Devices(AMD0.23%)shares -- for very different reasons. Netflix took a deep price cut in 2022, as investors worried about the company's new strategy and the inflation-burdened economy. It's often a bad sign when a high-growth business refocuses on a different set of business metrics, after all. You don't change a winning recipe, so there had to be something wrong when Netflix stepped away from maximizing subscriber additions in favor of \"profitable growth\" at that point. Right? As it turns out, Netflix was just taking the next step in its long-term evolution. With media-streaming services taking over the media market, there's less room for high-octane subscriber growth in the largest and most lucrative markets. So it made sense to try some new ideas such as ad-supported subscriptions and live sports coverage while givingaccount-sharing familiesa couple of options. If you grabbed some Netflix shares in that period of temporary cheapness, you could have gained as much as 667% by today, June 25 2025. Netflix has almost kept up with mightyNvidia(NVDA0.52%)over that period, which also happens to span most of theartificial intelligence(AI) boom. Both stocks left the S&P 500 far behind, despite historically strong returns in that index:  NFLXdata byYCharts And the thing is, Netflix is still a great buy today. This is not the end of the rocket ride. The stock has gained 43% year-to-date, and it looks expensive at first glance. Netflix shares trade at lofty valuation ratios, such as 60 times trailing earnings and 13.6 times sales. At the same time, Netflix is growing faster where it counts the most -- on the bottom line. Trailing twelve-month earnings have nearly doubled in three years, while free cash flows rose from breakeven to $7.4 billion. So Netflix's sales got over the 2022 speed bump and are growing quickly again. Meanwhile, the company is converting a stellar 18.5% of those incoming revenues into cash profits. I can go on, but you don't need to hear me gushing about Netflix. You get the point by now -- Netflix is a tremendous business and the soaring stock should still be able to rise much higher in the long run. This one is worth buying even when the shares aren't cheap. Speaking of Nvidia, I'm intrigued by one of its chief rivals. AMD shares have gained 19% in 2025, but only 76% over the last three years. Yes, that's barely ahead of the S&P 500's three-year gains and far behind Nvidia's 672% jump. After waxing poetic about Netflix, I'll cut to the chase this time. AMD looks ready to steal market share from Nvidia in the all-important AI market. The latest and upcoming versions of AMD's AI accelerator series are surprisingly competitive. Nvidia isn't winning every big-ticket contract just by showing up anymore. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is impressed by the recently launched AMD Instinct MI350 and MI400 chips, calling them \"an amazing thing\" in a conference last week. The organization behind ChatGPT will use AMD's accelerators in the next generation of its AI back-end systems. These processors provide top-notch AI performance at a distinctly lower price point than Nvidia's Blackwell solutions. AMD's accelerators won't be the right tool for every job, but they will chip away at Nvidia's commanding lead. Image source: Getty Images. And that's not the whole story.Meta Platformsalready uses the older MI300 chips in its Llama series of large language models, looking forward to doing more with the newer chips.IBM(IBM0.46%)sees great value in running AIinference processeson AMD Instinct chips with Red Hat software. The beat goes on. AMD has a long list of very excited large-scale AI customers these days, and this surge is already boosting its financial results. Data center revenues rose 57% year-over-year in the latest earnings report while AMD's earnings increased by 55%. The company still looks small next to Nvidia's trillion-dollar market cap and six-fold advantage in top-line sales. But I expect the minnow to grow larger in the coming years. The best way to take advantage of AMD's blossoming business is to grab a few shares in 2025.AMD's stock should soar in the near future, as Wall Street wraps its collective head around the company's game-changing innovation.",

        "content": "While it may not always work out, successfully betting on new technological trends can be a clear path to building wealth. This is exactly whatNvidia(NVDA0.52%)investors know very well. As of June 24, shares of this artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure powerhouse have soared 1,460% in the past five years. Nvidia is the world's second-most-valuable enterprise, with a market capitalization of nearly $3.6 trillion. But should you buy thistop AI stockright now? I think investors would be better served by learning both the bull and bear cases for the company. Image source: Nvidia. In the past few years, no topic has attracted everyone's attention quite like AI. And Nvidia, with its top-notchgraphics processing units(GPUs) that power AI training, has been the leading beneficiary.This is clear when looking at the company's incredible growth. Between Q1 2023 and Q1 2026 (ended April 27), revenue rocketed 431% higher. Innovation remains at the heart of everything Nvidia does. Sales of the latest Blackwell architecture was the \"fastest ramp in company history,\" according to CFO Colette Kress. When it comes to data center GPUs, it's estimated that Nvidia has more than a 90% market share. Profitability has been equally noteworthy, with operating income rising 1,037% during the same time in the last three years. Nvidia commands strong pricing power, supporting the bottom line. Demand should remain robust for the foreseeable future because Nvidia's customers can't risk falling behind in their own AI initiatives. So-called hyperscalers plan to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on AI-related infrastructure, which directly benefits Nvidia. While investors might be familiar with the company's dominance in the hardware space, Nvidia is also finding success with itsCUDA software. This allows developers to build AI models that work specifically for Nvidia GPUs. Consequently, customers faceswitching costs, a key competitive strength for the business. One of the biggest risks for Nvidia is the innovation happening in China. For instance,DeepSeekdeveloped AI models using older chips that need less computing power. This could lead to costs plummeting, as customers realize they don't need to spend so much on high-end GPUs from Nvidia and can, instead, power their AI applications with cheaper alternatives. In essence, the hardware and software behind AI could becomecommoditized. The result would be that Nvidia loses its differentiation, leading to revenue and profit pressure. Speaking of China, Nvidia also has been directly impacted by trade spats. The White House banned sales of the company's high-performing chips to the second-largest economy. To make matters worse, Nvidia's H20 chips, which were made to comply with trade restrictions, have since been banned for sale in China, which resulted in billions in write-downs of excess inventory. Because of how important AI innovation is on a geopolitical level, Nvidia likely will continue to be restricted in its efforts to sell chips to customers in China in some way. That shuts out demand from a huge market. Investors should keep an eye on the risks mentioned. However, the bull case is more compelling at this point. The market agrees, of course, as evidenced by the stock's monster gain in recent years. The valuation could push some prospective investors into the stock. Shares trade at aforward price-to-earnings ratioof 34.4. Given that consensus analyst estimates call for earnings per share to increase at a compound annual rate of 30% between fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2028, the current valuation looks reasonable. There remains a lot of uncertainty as to how things will shake out, thanks to how quickly the environment can change with such a dynamic and revolutionary technology. But investors seeking AI exposure in their portfolios should consider starting a small position in Nvidia.",

The executive offloaded 100,000sharesin two batches, completed on June 20 and June 23, bringing in roughly $14.5 million before costs. These moves mark the initial steps in a broader plan approved earlier this year that outlines sales of up to 6 million shares. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. Despite the transactions, Huang remains Nvidia's largest individual stakeholder, holding 859 million shares, an estimated 4% of the company's total float. The sale represents less than 1% of his position, indicating the action is more likely a part of personal portfolio management rather than a shift in outlook on Nvidia's future.

        "content": "Technology (XLK) is once again at the forefront of market momentum, leading sector gains over the past month as investorspile back into growth. Wall Street strategists say theAI-fueled rallystill has legs, arguing that even at these elevated levels, Big Tech remains cheap. \"US equities in general, and tech stocks in particular, are still below their peak of earlier this year, so there is arguably room for the relief rally to continue,\" Capital Economics' John Higgins wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. Over the past week, the megacap-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) returned to record highs, with chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA)now nearing a $4 trillion valuationafter logging back-to-back all-time closing highs. That momentum has helped propel the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks back into a leadership position, fueled by stronger-than-expected earnings,easing macroeconomic fears, and continued investor enthusiasm over artificial intelligence. \"Some of these megacaps don't look that expensive to me relative to the growth potential,\" Jordan Klein, tech analyst at Mizuho, told Yahoo Finance, pointing to Alphabet (GOOG,GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) as names that still offer value at current levels. Meanwhile, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, who has called Nvidia the \"godfather of AI,\" estimated the chipmaker could eventually hit a $5 trillion to $6 trillion valuation as AI use cases expand into consumer-facing applications, robotics, and autonomous tech. \"The Street is still underestimating [Nvidia's longer-term] growth by 15% to 20%,\" Ives told Yahoo Finance earlier this week. \"That could be conservative.\" Investor sentiment has flipped sharply since the market's April lows, with money flowing back into tech after a brief period of defensive positioning amidescalating fears of a US recessionon the heels ofPresident Trump's \"Liberation Day\" announcement. In a note to clients on Tuesday, Bank of America said tech inflows last week reached their highest level since June 2024. \"The mistake was people were quick to write off the Mag Seven,\" Klein said. \"Tech went from a big overweight exiting last year to being an underweight by April and May.\" Now, with markets moving past peak uncertainty and investors gaining more clarity on trade policies, Klein argued that the case for tech is strengthening. \"These are massive companies, extremely well run,\" he said. \"Their balance sheets and their ability to maintain margin and cash flows is unparalleled.\" Mark Newton, global head of technical strategy at Fundstrat, agreed the current setup favors Wall Street bulls: \"Markets are acting great,\" he said. \"Sentiment remains offsides and that\u2019s a key message. Until we see hedge funds and [CTAs, or algorithm-driven traders] really start to pour money back in, trends look great, the economy is good, and earnings are good.\" Adding conviction to the upside, the rally is no longer confined to just tech alone. Over the past week, industrials, financials, transports, and consumer discretionary stockshave all staged meaningful rebounds, signaling broad market participation that, in Newton\u2019s view, strengthens the case for further gains. \"Many people get skeptical as indices hit new all-time highs,\" he said. \"But honestly, that\u2019s the time you really got to pay attention.\" And while concerns about tariffs, interest rates, and geopolitical risks remain, the market\u2019s abilityto look through short-term noiseis exactly what\u2019s driving the rebound. \"Market tends to price in events like [geopolitical conflict or tariffs] very, very quickly,\" Newton said. \"If the market's truly caught off guard like it was in early April, then yes, you might have temporary periods of downside volatility.

        "header": "Gen Z Sees Recession Indicators Everywhere. Should You Be Listening?",
        "content": "Generation Z is using social media to voice concerns about a potential U.S. recession, drawing attention to signs they believe are indicators of economic stress: from Lady Gaga\u2019s newest album to 2000s-style low-rise jeans. Is this an exaggerated response to uncertainty, or is Gen Z tapped into early economic warning signs that might typically go unnoticed? While it can be tempting to get sucked into these theories, ultimately, experts and data suggest that these are unreliable indicators and that a recession is not looming. Here\u2019s what to know. Generation Z is interpreting the return of 2000s trends as indicators of an impending recession. The resurgence of fashion styles such as low-rise jeans, cheetah print, and rhinestone apparel parallels the cultural trends leading up to the 2008 Great Recession. In turn, Gen Z is concluding that these are warning signs of a similar time period, rather than turning to actual economic data and expert analysis. Music is another way Gen Z is interpreting recession indicators. For instance, Lady Gaga\u2019s latest album has led TikTok users to comment on how the country is heading towards economic turmoil due to the album's similarity to her pre-recession era music. Newer artists, such as Chappell Roan, are also sparking commentary on the resemblance of 2000s-styled music, reinforcing this theory. Social media plays a primary role in spreading Gen Z\u2019s economic theories. For example, Gen Z has started incorporating these discussions in trending TikTok formats, such as \"Get Ready With Me\"-styled videos. So, is there any merit to what Gen Z sees as cultural cues to a souring economy? Established economic indicators suggest no. Traditionally, economists look at GDP, unemployment rates, and the stock market to gauge recession risk. Let\u2019s break down where each of these stands. Government data reports that GDP fell at an annual rate of 0.2 percent in the first quarter of 2025. A drop in government spending, offset partially by investment and consumer activity, contributed to the GDP decline.For a recession to start, there needs to be an increase in the unemployment rate and a decrease in GDP for two consecutive quarters. J.P. Morgan anticipates a 0.25 percent annualized growth rate in GDP for the second half of 2025. Based on their data, they estimate that the probability of a recession has decreased from 60 percent to 40 percent over the last quarter due to a reduction in tariffs on China by the U.S. Economists and policy makers use the Sahm rule to identify if there is a recession, as described by Congress. The rule signals a recession if \u201cthe three-month moving average of the unemployment rate increases by 0.5 percentage points or more relative to its low in the previous 12 months.\u201d Unemployment rates are currently at 4.2 percent, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. For comparison, the unemployment rate before the2008 recessionwas 5.0 percent.Thus, the rule has not been triggered, indicating that there is no recession, though it remains a useful early indicator of a potential recession. The National Bureau of Economic Research has not declared the U.S. to be in a recession. The Dow was down just 0.1% on June 18, 2025. This particular downturn, however, appears to reflect investor caution rather than signaling an impending recession. For reference, the Dowdeclined 7% on September 29, 2008. Gen Z's recession indicators, such as music and fashion, may be persuasive, but their concerns do not reflect actual trends. While the pressures of federal layoffs and tariff tensions persist, most traditional indicators signal a moderately stable environment and do not suggest the country is in a recession.Ultimately, while Gen Z's recession interpretations may not be reliable, theydohighlight a cultural shift in how younger generations understand the economy, relying on cultural cues rather than traditional data.",

        "content": "One of the keys to Warren Buffett\u2019s success is not taking shortcuts. While many investors rely on news sources for brief information about a company\u2019s latest financials, the world\u2019s most famous investor reads every page of the company reports. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing what you can find when you just turn the page,\u201d Buffett said at Berkshire Hathaway's 2025shareholder meeting. \u201cI would say that turning every page is one important ingredient to bring to the investment field. And very few people do turn every page, and the ones who turn every page aren\u2019t going to tell you what they\u2019re finding, so you got to do a little of it yourself.\" Turning every page means examining all investment literature published by the publicly traded companies you are invested in or considering investing in. That includes the10-Ks,10-Qs, and8-Ksthey are required to file with theSecurities and Exchange Commission(SEC). And it's not just reading. These statements need to be deeply analyzed and compared to previous filings and those from similar companies. Everything must be absorbed, from thebalance sheetandincome and cash flow statementsto management\u2019s commentary and the footnotes. The goal is to fully understand what the company does, how it\u2019s run, its strengths and weaknesses, how it ranks against peers and past performance, and if it makes a good investment at the current price. Understanding this can be very time-consuming. However, it gets easier with experience, and what you learn will turn you into a much better investor who is capable of spotting both red flags and opportunities others may be missing. It should be noted that Buffettsuggeststhat the average investor just put their money in a low-cost S&P 500 indexexchange-traded fund(ETF). But if you want to try toreplicate his approachand find companies worth investing in, you need to start with time and a passion for stocks. An understanding of the various technical terms and the fundamentals of each business sector is also necessary. What could be a red flag, say, for a retailer might be totally normal for an aerospace and defense company. Information about what Buffett looks for in company statements can be found in the book \"Warren Buffett and the Interpretation of Financial Statements.\u201d Key things he generally wants to see are: Screening for these requirements can help identify good businesses. However, they aren\u2019t the only thing you should focus on. If you want to really invest like Buffett, you need to look at every page. Often, the most successful people in their field got to where they are by being obsessive about their craft. Buffett is no exception. The Oracle of Omaha didn\u2019t make billions by chance. His success came from leaving no stone unturned in his hunt for investments, which he mainly achieved by reading every page he could get his hands on, and continuing this habit throughout his career, even after he had long mastered company accounts and was already incredibly rich.",

        "content": "The geopolitical state of the world is rapidly shifting, as are the profiles of the locations that the world\u2019s wealthiest people call home. For example, according to reports from investment migration consultancy Henley & Partners, the number ofaffluent Americans looking to move abroadhas spiked since the 2024 election. The number of Chinese millionaires leaving China has increased since the country lifted its severe,COVID-related travel restrictions, with the outflow projected to shatter records in 2025.And the United Kingdom is hemorrhaging millionaires, while others, such as the United Arab Emirates, are seeing large inflows. The question is, what impact does the migration of millionaires have on countries and your investments? There are well-known issues associated with millionaire immigration into new communities, such as inflated real estate prices,strained local housing markets, weakened tax regimes, and broadened social inequalities. Much has been written about the downside of theinflux of millionairesinto countries, but far less attention is paid to the reverse dynamic: the fallout when the rich leave. \u201cI think sometimes people don't realize how important millionaires are,\u201d explained Andrew Amoils, Head of Research at New World Wealth. \u201cIt's not so much about [the taxes they pay]. It's more about all the jobs they create.\u201d He noted that these jobs are created throughinvestment in the local stock marketas well as through patronage of sectors that are highly reliant on wealthy individuals. These include property, wealth management, high fashion, and luxury hotels and restaurants. A large enough exodus can depress these areas, triggering stagnation or even contraction. These effects can have negative consequences for investors focused on those sectors in particular, as well as on the broader market. However, the severity of such an exodus varies from country to country. Nations that dominate the global financial ecosystem are able to benefit fromhigh-net-worth individualseven when those individuals do not live within their boundaries. Nations that are less than dominant don't. According to Amoils, the majority of the world's countries, including South Africa, Australia, and Italy, need the highly affluent to move to their countries to benefit from their spending and investing. \u201cIn the case of the United States, because of the huge number of people that invest in theNew York Stock Exchange and the NASDAQthat are not living in the U.S., they don't necessarily need the millionaires to move there to benefit from them,\u201d said Amoils. Switzerland is another country that doesn't need a direct influx, due to its robust wealth management sector. \u201cA lot of wealthy people were keeping their money in Switzerland without actually moving to Switzerland,\u201d Amoils explained. \u201cBut that's kind of been slowed down now because of all thebanking rules around offshore banking.\u201d In 2024, the five countries with the greatest number of high-net-worth individuals leaving were China, the United Kingdom, India, South Korea, and Russia. Despite the sometimes muted impact that can result when millionaires leave countries like the U.S., the affluent depart for significant reasons that might indicate nations in trouble: \u201cWe've always found that [millionaire migration] is a measure of how a country is doing because if there are a lot of rich people moving to a country, it tends to be a good sign about what's going on in the country in general,\" Amoils noted. \"On the flip side, probably even more so, if there are a lot of rich people leaving a country, that's a very negative sign.\u201d In today\u2019svolatile geopolitical climate, where the wealthy go and why can be a valuable signal for investors, policymakers, and everyday market watchers. The influx of millionaires into a country can boost its economy and the account values of individual and institutional investors. It indicates where affluent people feel their money is safe and can grow. The departure of millionaires from a country can be a sign that all is not well, including conditions for their money and investments.",

The number of billionaires (3,028 in 78 countries in 2025) continues to rise each year, and experts believe that trend will continue going forward. Each year,Forbesranks the number of global billionaires according to their net worth. As noted above, the U.S. had 902 billionaires in 2025, which was higher than the 813 billionaires recorded in 2024.The number of billionaires in the U.S. not only set a record for the country but was also the highest in the world. The top five people from the U.S. on the list and theirnet worthas of March 7, 2025, are: For the second year in a row, China (including Hong Kong) and India had the second- and third-highest number of billionaires with 516 and 205, respectively. India\u2019sMukesh Ambaniwas the 18th-richest billionaire with $92.5 billion, whileTikTokco-founder Zhang Yiming of China was the 23rd-richest person with a net worth of $65.5 billion. A total of 288 new billionaires entered the list in 2025, including some famous names: Forbeshas been publishing its list of billionaires since 1987, when there were only 140 billionaires. As of 2025, 3,028 people make up the list. The publication usesstock pricesand exchange rates in part to determine the net worth of the people on its list. The total net worth of the 3,028 billionaires onForbes\u2019 2025 billionaires list as of March 7, 2025, which is an increase of almost $2 trillion from 2024. So what makes these countries such hotspots for billionaires? This is likely a combination of factors, according toVibhas Madan, professor of economics at the LeBow College of Business at Drexel University. These factors, he suggests, are strong economies, large populations, innovation, favorable business climates, and access tocapital markets. Robert Korajczyk, Harry G. Guthmann professor of finance at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University, echoed this, but also credits the opening of global markets with the rise of global billionaires. \u201cWhen China joined theWTO (World Trade Organization), that essentially opened up a lot of opportunities for China,\u201d he said. \u201cInternet access has been huge for India, while innovation has been encouraged in the U.S., so it makes sense that they\u2019re on top.\u201d Madan said he isn\u2019t surprised that the number of billionaires has grown and believes that trend will continue and may even go higher. \u201cGlobalGDP (gross domestic product)values are going up as a trend, so you expect there would be more people crossing over the billion-dollar mark. It\u2019s just a natural trend ofeconomic growth,\u201d he added. \u201cI think it\u2019s more people than you\u2019ve ever thought about, even going to trillionaire at some point in time.\u201d The finance and investments industry has the highest number of billionaires, with 464. This makes up 15% of the list. The technology industry had the highest concentration of billionaire creation, according toForbes. There were a total of 401 tech billionaires in 2025. Together, this group held a combined net worth of $3.2 trillion.This shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise, Korajczyk told Investopedia. \u201cInnovation and market power are likely to create value. The industries with these characteristics change over time,\u201d he said. \u201cIt happens that technology has been an innovation leader recently.\u201d There are several reasons why tech is trending, which is likely helping propel the billionaire push: The number of billionaires is rising each year, and so is their combined net worth. These individuals also hold a significant amount of the world\u2019swealth. According to Oxfam, that can be a problem. The world\u2019s richest 1% hold more wealth than 95% of the rest of the world, with nearly half of the world\u2019sfinancial assets(43%) owned by the richest 1%. That trend isn\u2019t lost in the U.S., either, where wealth is concentrated at the top: Not only do these individuals control a great deal of wealth, but they also hold a \u201cmonopolistic concentration of power,\u201d giving them \u201cinfluence over industries and public opinion.\u201dThis can lead to social inequality and tax avoidance, as well as hinder economic growth. But proponents say billionaires like MacKenzie Scott,Michael Bloomberg, Warren Buffett, andBill Gateshave a tremendous amount of influence on innovation and charitable giving, using their wealth to address progress, poverty, and social change. In May 2025, Gates announced that he would give away almost all of his wealth over 20 years and close his foundation by 2045. Forbesreleases its World\u2019s Billionaires List each year, highlighting the richest people around the globe. The majority were reported in the U.S. in 2025, with 902 billionaires in total. But there were record-breaking numbers, with 3,028 around the world, celebrity billionaires, and a record number of newcomers to the list.",

(NASDAQ:CRWV) is an AI infrastructure company that provides businesses with hardware to let them run their AI applications. It is one of the few pure-play firms of its kind and the shares have gained a whopping 298% since their IPO in March. Soon after the IPO, Cramer dismissed news reports that CoreWeave, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWV) had been created specially by NVIDIA to create demand for AI GPUs. This time around, he commented on the strong share price performance which indicated that even Cramer hadn\u2019t expected CoreWeave, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWV)\u2019s shares to perform the way that they did: \u201cLook can I just say that these are some of the most bullish things I\u2019ve seen in my career? That CoreWeave could have been priced at 40 and it went to 178. That this Circle just keeps being bought, that Palantir keeps being bought. That a Broadom is going, that Goldman is going. . .\u201d Recently, the CNBC host discussed some of the drivers of CoreWeave, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRWV)\u2019s share price performance: \u201cTake CoreWeave. This is the company that came public at $40 a share, [a] company I recommended and pushed incredibly hard to. People didn\u2019t believe me. Many chose to bet against the stock. 32% of the shares are sold short. On Friday, CoreWeave hit a high of $187. Stock still sits at $172 and change. Sure, it reported a great quarter, but a lot of this move is because so many people were betting against it because the company picked a bad time to come public. I had tremendous conviction that CoreWeave would make a big move, but not this big. Again, I think discipline must trump conviction, and you gotta do some selling here. Well, I still like the stock. I recognize that much of this move was powered by panicked short sellers. Take something off the table, please.\u201d While we acknowledge the potential of CRWV as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

While Cramer had frequently discussed the stock in the first quarter, it appeared to have fallen off his radar more recently. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\u2019s shares have gained 14% year-to-date after having lost 37% by early April. The shares have benefited from the strong performance of other semiconductor firms which has indicated to them that the demand for AI chips continues to remain robust. Broadcom Inc.

        "content": "Members of Congress generally like to trade stocks, and many of them are suspiciously good at it. Some say it\u2019s luck or good investing instincts. Some critics argue that they're using inside knowledge about forthcoming policy changes and economic developments. Whatever their secret, mimicking the serial market-beatingstock trades of members of Congressis a tempting proposition. And it\u2019s now possible, thanks to laws requiring members of Congress and their spouses to disclose their investments, as well as a pair ofexchange-traded funds (ETFs). In 2023, the fund manager Subversive launched two ETFs designed to mirror the stock trades of members of Congress and their families. One, the Unusual Whales Subversive Democratic Trading ETF (NANC), focuses on the Democratic party. The other, the Unusual Whales Subversive Republican Trading ETF (GOP), covers Republican trades.These ETFs get their information from Unusual Whales, an outfit that tracks congressional stock trades. The funds weight their holdings based on the total invested by each party. Each has an expense ratio of 0.74%.A look at their holdings reveals some key differences. The Democratic portfolio is tech-focused and growth-oriented, while the Republican portfolio is morediversified, with investments in energy, industrials, bitcoin, and financial services. Since the funds launched in February 2023, the Democratic ETF has held a clear advantage. As of May 31, 2025, it had returned 58.9%, or 22.18% on an annualized basis. The broader Republican ETF, meanwhile, delivered a cumulative return of 30.2% since inception, or 12.09% on an annualized basis. In isolation, that\u2019s respectable. However, when compared against the Democratic performance and the significantly cheaper Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (SPY) and its expense ratio of 0.09%, its price tag becomes harder to justify. There are several reasons to be skeptical about investing in these ETFs: The idea of mirroring the trades of the politically connected is compelling, and these ETFs offer a novel way to act on that strategy. However, investors should weigh this appeal against the funds' significant challenges. The inherent delay in trade reporting and high expense ratios are practical hurdles to profitability. In addition, the success of the funds relies on a controversial premise that is facing growing scrutiny. Investing in these ETFs is ultimately a bet not just on lawmakers'stock-picking skills, but on the persistence of a system that allows these trades in the first place.",

        "content": "QuantumScape CorporationQS recently hit a major milestone, boosting investor interest as 17.4 million shares were traded on Thursday, a 38% increase from the previous session. QuantumScape\u2019s shares jumped 34.9% in yesterday\u2019s trading and have increased 92.7% over the past month. The solid-state battery maker is now drawing attention from investors due to higher trading activity and positive news, drawing comparisons toNVIDIA Corporation\u2019s NVDA success with artificial intelligence (AI) technology, and prompting thoughts about its potential as a buying opportunity. Let\u2019s explore \u2013 QuantumScape\u2019s shares surged following a breakthrough in its solid-state battery production process. QuantumScape introduced its Cobra separator technology, reigniting hopes among market analysts that the solid-state battery dream is becoming a reality. The innovative Cobra separator process is 25 times faster than the previous Raptor system, and a more compact and cost-effective method for producing solid-state battery separators. Cobra will require less floor space than its predecessor and is designed for gigawatt-scale battery production. All these factors make Cobra economically viable for mass production. QuantumScape\u2019s Cobra separator process reached baseline production ahead of schedule, marking a breakthrough in solid-state batteries for electric vehicles (EVs). This development overcomes the challenge of large-scale production that has previously hindered the EV industry\u2019s adoption of the technology. If QuantumScape fulfills its battery innovation potential, it could transform EV power and challenge NVIDIA\u2019s performance, but it\u2019s uncertain whether it can replicate NVIDIA\u2019s successes given its history of unmet promises. Meanwhile, the rising demand for Blackwell chips, AI graphics processing units (GPUs) and CUDA software will fuel NVIDIA\u2019s growth in the cloud and automotive sectors, making it too early to expect QuantumScape to match NVIDIA\u2019s accomplishments. Nonetheless, NVIDIA has been able to generate profits and control costs in a better way than QuantumScape, with a return on equity (ROE) of 109.9% compared to QS\u2019s negative 41.4%. QuantumScape struggles to use shareholder investments effectively (read more: Is C3.ai Stock the Next NVIDIA and a Buy?). Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Despite the recent political challenges, the EV market is set to grow. Demand for advanced batteries remains strong, particularly for those that are safer, lighter and quicker to charge. QuantumScape\u2019s advancements in solid-state lithium battery production could lead to significant milestones and boost its stock value. Stakeholders are advised to retain their shares. For new entrants, the QuantumScape stock might be risky. Meeting long-term EV contract demands and maintaining quality standards remain challenges, and falling behind could cause QuantumScape\u2019s stock price to drop. The QuantumScape stock, anyhow, is presently more volatile than the markets it trades in. It has a beta of 4.27.

Why? Because we're just at the early stages of the buildout of the infrastructure around AI. It's like we're just laying the track of the transcontinental railroad. Nvidia is the absolute choke point to that, and if we're going to grow AI and what it's going to do for labor productivity and every company in the world, Nvidia is going to be a key part of that. And so we think that their chips are absolutely essential to growth. We think their chips are absolutely essential to increased labor productivity, and we think that the demand signal for this is going to only get greater over time.\u201d Despite a $4.5 billion inventory charge related to US import restrictions for China, Nvidia expects gross margins to reach the mid-70% range by late this year due to scaling Blackwell production. NVDA bulls believe the company can easily offset losses related to China amid new products and market diversification.\u00a0 Saudi Arabia's Humain plans to buy more than 200,000 AI GPUs from Nvidia, potentially generating $15 billion in sales. The UAE reportedly has an agreement for up to 500,000 GPUs. Even without China\u2019s involvement for now, Nvidia said nearly 100 AI factories are under construction.

Despite reporting strong quarterly results, the stock pulled back amid concerns that AI-related demand may be plateauing near-term and that capital expenditures by hyperscalers could moderate. Additionally, investor anxiety rose following the announcement of sweeping new tariffs, which sparked fears of supply chain disruptions and rising input costs across the semiconductor industry. We continue to believe that NVIDIA remains one of the most strategically important companies in global computing, with best-in class GPUs, a dominant software ecosystem, and expanding opportunities in inference, networking, and edge AI.

This explains why private placements are on the rise in 2025 following a slump that began in 2022 when the Federal Reserve raised interest rates. As developing technologies become increasingly prominent, investors are scurrying for exposure to those sectors that aren\u2019t well represented in public markets \u2014 yet. \u201cFifteen years ago, people wanted to invest in Uber because you couldn\u2019t get it in the public market,\u201d Collmer said. \u201cToday they are looking for the artificial intelligence, robotics and defense technologies companies that they can\u2019t get in the public market. They tend to be big industries that are being disrupted and the disruptors are in the private market.\u201d Take for instance Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX, along with OpenAI, Stripe and Databricks Inc., all of which have turned to private secondary sales to provide liquidity to investors, including employees. That market has expanded to around $60 billion, up from $50 billion last year, according to a report released by research firm Pitchbook last month. New York-based Ramp Business Corp. recently revealed that new and existing investors had purchased $150 million of shares from employees and early investors at a price valuing the fintech startup at $13 billion. IPO Uptick Coming Despite the growth in private secondary sales, companies will eventually see the benefit of going public, according to Cully Davis, Citigroup\u2019s head of growth equity. Davis said there\u2019s at least one sign that there could be an uptick in the number of growth IPOs: A flurry of publicly traded tech companies, including some new ones, are selling zero-coupon convertible bonds to raise money. \u201cWhen that market starts to open up, and it has opened up dramatically in the last month and a half, those are really positive signals,\u201d he added. From an M&A perspective, an IPO also has its advantages. \u201cIt\u2019s quite helpful for a company to have a legitimate publicly traded security that is liquid and that is independently valued and allows them to pursue acquisitions with confidence and with a currency that has real value,\u201d he said. Kore.ai, which is a Citigroup client, is focused on growth for now while keeping its options open. The AI software firm was valued at nearly $800 million in 2023 after a capital infusion of $150 million from a group of investors that include Nvidia Corp. \u201cWe are figuring out what\u2019s the right path of growth, whether it\u2019s through an incremental acquisition or, at the right point, looking at an IPO,\u201d said DK Sharma, Kore.ai\u2019s chief operating officer. \u201cBut right now, we\u2019re focused on getting the appropriate muscles for growing big time on top of our momentum today.

        "content": "Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger built Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A,BRK.B) into a massive empire by prioritizing aqualitative understanding of a businessover complex financial modeling. While they certainly usedfinancial ratiosand other analytical tools, they didn't let spreadsheets drive their investment decisions. Instead, these legendary investors focused on something many overlook: Deeply understanding how businesses actually work. This business-first philosophy outperformed the market for decades, challenging the assumption that successful investing requires sophisticated mathematical models. Buffett and Munger viewed buying stocks as purchasing parts of real businesses. \"We are looking at businesses exactly like we'd look at them if somebody came in and offered us the entire business,\" Buffett said in 2013. \"We try to think, 'What is this place going to look like in five or 10 years, and how sure are we of it?'\" Instead of focusing simply onshort-term market swingsorprice-to-earnings ratios, they would ask: Is this a business I\u2019d want to own forever? Is it likely to be stronger a decade from now? The duo avoided complicated businesses they couldn't understand. Instead, they sought companies with straightforward models, consistent earnings, and \"economic moats\"\u2014sustainable competitive advantages. They looked for businesses large enough to matter, with good management and strong returns on equity. \"We don't know how to buy stocks just by looking at financial figures,\" Munger said in 2013.\"We may be influenced a little by some of that data, but we need to know more about how the company actually functions.\" Buffett and Munger assessed management quality, customer relationships,company culture, and industry position as drivers of long-term success. Instead of obsessing over daily stock prices, Buffett and Munger focused on a company's fundamentals. \"Look for more value in terms ofdiscounted future cash flowthan you\u2019re paying for. Move only when you have an advantage,\" Munger told the Harvard Law Bulletin in 2001. \"You have to understand the odds and have the discipline to bet only when the odds are in your favor.\" Buffett and Munger were famous for theirpatience. They often turned away investments that others would have jumped at, waiting for businesses that were the right fit. Financial statementstell only part of the story. They reflect the past, not the future, and can be distorted by accounting practices and economic cycles. Numbers can also miss critical human elements like leadership quality, company culture, and competitive positioning. \"People with very high IQs who are good at math naturally look for a system where they can just look at the math and know what security to buy,\" Munger said in 2013. \"It's not that easy. You really have to understand the company and its competitive position and the reasons why its competitive position is what it is, and that is often not disclosed by the math.\" Buffett and Munger understood that sustainable competitive advantages\u2014whether throughbrand power,network effects, or regulatory barriers\u2014often determine long-term success more than current financial metrics. Buffett and Munger proved that successful investing centers on understanding businesses at their core. While financial data provides valuable insights, their approach emphasizedbusiness fundamentals, competitive positioning, and management quality over complex mathematical models. Their strategy was simple but not easy: invest only in businesses you truly understand, with sustainable advantages and trustworthy leaders, and be patient enough to let compound growth work over decades.",

From January through May 2025, there was an 80% increase in job cuts compared to the same period last year, according to a report by the business and executive coaching firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Retail layoffs alone soared by 274% year-over-year.With nearly half of U.S. managers predicting their company will lay off workers in 2025,preparing your financesis more important than ever. \u201cStop the emotional spiral and start organizing,\u201dStoy Hall, CEO of the financial advisory firm Black Mammoth, told Investopedia. \u201cCreate a \u2018worst-case-scenario\u2019 budget immediately. Cut every nonessential item. You need to know how lean you can live\u2014this isn\u2019t panic, this is preparation. Clarity reduces fear.\u201d Before you make any big decisions, get a clear picture of your financial resources. \u201cStart bytaking stock of what you havein all your bank accounts and liquid funds. Knowing exactly what resources are available gives you clarity and helps you make informed decisions about next steps,\u201dDanika Waddell, founder of Xena Financial Planning, told Investopedia. Once you know what you have, the next step is figuring out how long that money will last if your paycheck stops. \u201cAdd up your cash, savings, and any expectedseverance or unemployment benefits. That number? That\u2019s your runway\u2014in months,\u201d Hall said. Divide this by your core monthly costs, such as housing, food, insurance, and minimum debt payments. If it amounts to less thanthree months of expenses, act now: Look forside gigs or temp workbefore you need it. This kind of preparation is more important than ever as U.S. employers announced about 696,000 job cuts through May 2025.That represents an 80% increase from the same period last year. Don\u2019t wait until after you\u2019re let go to gather important documents and review your benefits. \u201cCheck your last pay stub for unused vacation or [paid time off], yourseverance package, and yourCOBRAor health care options,\u201d Hall said. If you delay, you could lose access to employer systems and critical benefits information. Waddell suggests reviewing your separation agreement and understanding your health insurance timeline. \u201cIf there is a separation agreement, review and sign it quickly. Sometimes with an attorney\u2019s help,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd don\u2019t delay in looking into health insurance options. While you may have 60 days to opt into COBRA, marketplace plans can\u2019t be retroactive, so you could face a coverage gap if you wait too long.\" If you\u2019re worried about job security, Hall recommends pausing aggressive debt payoff and shifting that cash into youremergency fund. \"Put debt payoff on pause and shift that cash into an emergency fund,\" he said. \"Liquidity wins during uncertain times.\" Lower-income years may also be a smart time to convert part of atraditional individual retirement accountto a Roth, since you\u2019ll pay less in taxes now and grow it tax-free. But avoidwithdrawing from your 401(k)unless it becomes necessary. Facing a layoff is never easy, but taking action now can help you weather the storm. Build a lean budget, calculate your runway, and secure your benefits before you lose access. Losing a job isn\u2019t a failure; it\u2019s a pivot point.

        "header": "Nvidia's stark turnaround is being powered by robots, hyperscalers, and sovereign AI",
        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) is riding a wave of AI enthusiasm that has sent its stock price soaring to new highs after being battered in the early part of the year on fears of new AI models out of China and tariff threats. On Friday, shares of Nvidia hit $157, up from $94 in April,marking a stunning turnaroundfor the world's leading AI chip company. The moves can be attributed to a number of factors turning in Nvidia's favor, including the successful ramp of the buildout of its Blackwell chip line, the explosion in interest around so-called sovereign AI, and the company's push into what it calls physical AI, or robotics. Nvidia's Blackwell ramp, the process of building out chips and increasing overall volume, has been a major win for the company. During its GTC Paris event earlier this month, Nvidia said it is now shipping 1,000 Grace Blackwell (GB200) server racks per week and is on track for its transition to its next-generation Blackwell Ultra-powered GB300 servers. Getting its chips and servers out the door as fast as possible has been key for Nvidia, especially after earlier delays as the company began to ramp production of Blackwell chips in late 2024. Nvidia said the GB300 line of chips will be able to slot directly into GB200 servers, which the company claims will make it easier for its customers to upgrade to its latest offerings. Nvidia also continues to benefit from the seemingly insatiable demand for its chips from hyperscalers, including Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG,GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), and xAI, among others. According to CFO Colette Kress, large cloud service providers accounted for just under 50% of the company's data centersales in its fiscal first quarter. And with hyperscalers expected to spend billions more on their AI buildouts in the coming months, there's little reason to believe that will slow down anytime soon. CEO Jensen Huang is also betting big on the idea of sovereign AI, or AI data centers built in specific countries to power their own AI needs. Huang was on hand during President Trump's visit to the Middle East in May, during which Trump announced that Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) will be able to purchase thousands of Nvidia chips for their data centers. One of those projects, the UAE's Project Stargate, could include 100,000 Nvidia GPUs,according to Reuters. Huang also touted sovereign AI plans for Europe during GTC Paris. \"The company is establishing AI technology centers in Germany, Sweden, Italy, Spain, UK, and Finland, and working with regional cloud and telco partners in France, UK, and Germany to build new AI datacenters with [tens] of thousands of Grace Blackwell systems and GPUs,\" Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote in an investor note following the event. \"They are planning for 20 AI factories to be deployed in Europe, several at gigawatt scale, and sees European compute capacity growing by a factor of 10x over the next 2 years,\" Rasgon added. Huang and company also continue to push further into physical AI, with the CEO calling it a multitrillion-dollar opportunity. Physical AI is another way of referring to the software and computers needed to power things like humanoid robots and self-driving cars. Nvidia offers both chips and the training information needed to run robots in factories and has been working in the automotive industry for years on self-driving car technologies. But don't expect to have a robot walking around your home anytime soon. Those kinds of bipedal butlers are likely years away from being something you can grab at your local Best Buy. Importantly, Nvidia has managed to shake off fears over the Trump administration's ban on sales of its chips to China. Despite taking a hefty charge on canceled orders, Wall Street analysts are more upbeat on the issue now that the ban is official and they no longer have to question whether one is coming or not. After all, there's comfort in certainty. Of course, Nvidia still faces the prospect of competition from rivals like AMD (AMD). And its own customers, including Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, are building or currently using their own in-house chips to take on Nvidia's offerings, making for a more complicated relationship.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Two years after Nvidia Corp. made history by becoming the first chipmaker to achieve a $1 trillion market capitalization, an even more remarkable milestone is within its grasp: becoming the first company to reach $4 trillion. Most Read from Bloomberg Philadelphia Transit System Votes to Cut Service by 45%, Hike Fares US Renters Face Storm of Rising Costs Squeezed by Crowds, the Roads of Central Park Are Being Reimagined Mapping the Architectural History of New York\u2019s Chinatown Sprawl Is Still Not the Answer After the emergence of China\u2019s DeepSeek sent the stock plunging earlier this year and stoked concerns that outlays on artificial intelligence infrastructure were set to slow, Nvidia shares have rallied back to a record. Its biggest customers remain full steam ahead on spending, much of which is flowing to its computing systems. A 67% gain from an April low has pushed its market capitalization to $3.8 trillion, overtaking Microsoft Corp. at $3.7 trillion to again become the world\u2019s most valuable company. Nvidia shares rose 1.8% Friday to close at another record high. With a broadening customer base clamoring for Nvidia\u2019s latest AI accelerators and competitors still distant, bulls are betting the chipmaker\u2019s shares have plenty of room to run. \u201cWe believe that Nvidia is truly uniquely positioned, and that it will sustain its position over the next decade-plus,\u201d said Aziz Hamzaogullari, founder, chief investment officer and portfolio manager of the growth equity strategies team at Loomis, Sayles & Co. Hamzaogullari isn\u2019t alone. This week, Loop Capital analyst Ananda Baruah raised Nvidia\u2019s price target to $250 from $175, a level that would equate to a roughly $6 trillion market value. Baruah, who has a buy rating on the stock, expects annual AI spending from various types of customers to rise to nearly $2 trillion by 2028. \u201cWhile it may seem fantastic that Nvidia fundamentals can continue to amplify from current levels, we remind folks that Nvidia remains essentially a monopoly for critical tech, and that it has pricing (and margin) power,\u201d Baruah wrote in a research note on June 25. The bullish sentiment behind Nvidia and other makers of AI gear is a stark reversal from earlier in the year when the emergence of advanced chatbots like DeepSeek, developed relatively cheaply in China, sparked fears that Nvidia\u2019s customers would cut spending. Instead, US tech giants are plowing even more money into computing infrastructure. Microsoft, Meta, Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc. are projected to put about $350 billion into capital expenditures in their upcoming fiscal years, up from $310 billion in the current year, according to the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Those companies account for more than 40% of Nvidia\u2019s revenue. Of course, there are still plenty of risks that could derail Nvidia\u2019s rally. The company relies on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. for the production of its chips, exposing Nvidia to US President Donald Trump\u2019s trade policies, which can change on a whim. Trump\u2019s 90-day pause on the stiffest tariffs is set to end on July 9. At the same time, there\u2019s no guarantee Nvidia\u2019s biggest customers won\u2019t change their tune on spending in coming years. Many of them are developing their own chips to avoid the steep prices commanded by Nvidia. \u201cThe valuation depends on the persistence of growth, and we already know that Nvidia\u2019s largest customers are trying to figure out ways to be more efficient with their spending, not just with Nvidia, but also offloading to their own silicon,\u201d said Dan Davidowitz, chief investment officer at Polen Capital Management. \u201cYou have to have very robust assumptions to get comfortable with the valuation, and we just don\u2019t have a good enough view on what that demand looks like.\u201d Nvidia shares are priced at 32 times earnings projected over the next 12 months, compared with 22 times for the S&P 500. The stock\u2019s valuation doesn\u2019t bother Loomis Sayles\u2019s Hamzaogullari, who remains a firm believer that AI will transform society and is convinced that Nvidia will remain a key winner as productivity gains from the technology expand. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean it will be steady Eddie all the time, that there won\u2019t be disruptions in spending, but this is a secular structural change, and Nvidia remains one of the biggest beneficiaries,\u201d Hamzaogullari said. \u201cThe stock still looks attractive given that backdrop.\u201d Top Tech News Masayoshi Son acknowledged the outlines of a succession plan, addressing what may be the single biggest concern among investors, and name-checked the head of SoftBank Group Corp.\u2019s telecom unit Junichi Miyakawa. House Republicans aim to get the Senate\u2019s landmark stablecoin legislation \u2014 known as the Genius Act \u2014 to President Donald Trump\u2019s desk for signature as soon as the week of July 7, according to people with direct knowledge of the strategy. Apple and Google\u2019s Android have been warned by a top German privacy regulator that the Chinese AI service DeepSeek, available on their app stores, constitutes illegal content because it exposes users\u2019 data to Chinese authorities. The US will need more nuclear power as it enters into greater competition with China, said Mike Gallagher, head of defense at Palantir Technologies Inc. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. elevated e-commerce head Jiang Fan while trimming the members of a longstanding leadership body, as the Chinese tech giant pivots toward AI and overseas expansion.

        "content": "Curious about where lawmakers invest their money? Politicians' investment choices often attract attention because of their unique position in shaping policy. In fact, a 2024 report by the trading platform Unusual Whales found that more than 20 members of Congress earned nearly double the S&P 500's average gain. Thanks to the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act, the public can see what members of Congress are investing in. But how do you actually find this information? And what can it tell you aboutmarket trendsor potentialconflicts of interest? The STOCK Act was passed in 2012 following high-profile reports of lawmakers making well-timed trades around major economic events, such as the 2008 financial crisis. It was designed to boost transparency and restore public trust. The law requires members of Congress and senior federal officials to disclose any securities transaction over $1,000 within 45 days of the trade. These disclosures cover politicians, as well as their spouses and dependent children. It's important to note thatinsider tradingby members of Congress is prohibited under federal securities law, just like it is for everyone else. The STOCK Act reaffirmed this prohibition and made clear that lawmakers can't use nonpublic information gained through their official duties for personal financial gain. However, proving insider trading requires demonstrating that someone knowingly usedmaterial, nonpublic information. That's a high legal bar, which is one reason there haven't yet been any prosecutions under the STOCK Act. After reported outsized gains by senior White House officials and members of Congress just before major tariff announcements in April 2025, the push toban securities tradingaltogether by those in Congress gained new momentum, with Senators Mark Kelly and Jon Ossoff reintroducing their Ban Congressional Stock Trading Act in May 2025. So, how can you get information on what politicians are buying and selling? Here are several options: Congressional trades are disclosed after the fact\u2014often 45 days later or more\u2014so you're seeing moves that may already be reflected in prices. In 2023, Business Insider identified 78 members of Congress who violated the law, highlighting enforcement gaps.As such, you should treat these disclosures as just one piece of your research puzzle, not a shortcut to guaranteed profits or market timing. In addition, not every politician is an expert investor, and many holdportfoliosriskier than most professionals would recommend. Following these trades too closely can expose you to unnecessary volatility or lead you to overlook your own financial goals. Always balance congressional data with your personalrisk tolerance, time horizon, and a diversified investment approach. Two exchange-traded funds (ETFs) now let youmirror congressional trades\u2014the Democratic-focusedNANCand Republican-focusedGOP. Since launching in February 2023, the Democratic ETF has significantly outperformed with a 58.9% return compared with the Republican ETF's 30.2% return. Both funds charge a highexpense ratio(0.74%) and face trading and information delays since trades aren't disclosed for up to 90 days after they occur. The STOCK Act provides important access to what lawmakers are buying and selling. While tracking these moves can offer insights into emerging sectors or companies that may be in the regulatory spotlight, remember that disclosure delays and enforcement gaps limit the practical value for investment timing. The real story here may be transparency itself. As public pressure mounts for stricter rules or outright trading bans, these disclosures serve more as a window into potential conflicts of interest than a reliable investment strategy.",

The S&P 500 advanced 0.5%, notching arecord closing high. The Nasdaq Composite also reached its highest-ever closing level, lifted by a gain of 0.5% on Friday. The Dow was up 1%. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the U.S. and China hadagreed on a trade framework, with the countries confirming details agreed upon earlier this month. President Donald Trump, meanwhile, said he wasending trade talks with Canada. Nike (NKE) shares skyrocketed 15%, posting the S&P 500's top performance on Friday, after the footwear and apparel company reportedsmaller-than-anticipated sales and profit declinesfor its fiscal fourth quarter. The results suggested that Nike is making progress on its turnaround plan under CEO Elliott Hill, who took the helm of the company last October. Nike executives said that the company could take a hit ofup to $1 billionif tariffs remain at current levels. Trade progress between the U.S. and China helped lift shares of aircraft manufacturer Boeing (BA), which climbed 5.9%. Analysts at Rothschild upgraded Boeing stock to \"buy\" from \"neutral,\" highlighting an acceleration in production as well as improvements in the aviation giant's financial picture, culture, and safety processes. Shares of data center real estate investment trust Equinix (EQIX) gained 5.3%, staging a partial recovery after suffering heavy losses over the past two trading days. Although this week's downturn related to the firm's muted growth forecasts and plans for major spending, Equinix remains a beneficiary of the demand for data center services driven by increasing adoption of artificial intelligence technologies. Signs of easing geopolitical tensions weighed on shares of big data analytics software firm Palantir Technologies (PLTR), which has secured significant contracts with the U.S. military.

        "content": "Investing.com -- OpenAI has started using Google\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) artificial intelligence chips to help power ChatGPT and related services, marking its first significant shift away from exclusive reliance on Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) hardware, according to a report by The Information. The move is part of a broader strategy by the AI company to reduce its dependence on Microsoft(NASDAQ:MSFT)-managed infrastructure. Through Google Cloud, OpenAI is renting Google\u2019s tensor processing units (TPUs) with the aim of cutting the costs associated with inference computing, the execution of models after training is completed. The decision could offer Google\u2019s TPUs a higher profile as a cost-effective alternative to Nvidia\u2019s widely used graphics processing units (GPUs), which dominate the AI sector. Previously, OpenAI sourced Nvidia chips primarily via partnerships with Microsoft and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) to train and deploy its models. While Google is providing some TPU capacity, it is reportedly not offering its most powerful versions to OpenAI, according to sources cited by The Information. That limitation suggests Google\u2019s most advanced TPUs remain reserved for internal use, including work on its own large language models under the Gemini project. For OpenAI, access to earlier versions of the TPUs still represents a step toward infrastructure diversification amid growing industry demand. It\u2019s still unclear whether OpenAI will use Google chips for model training or limit them to inference workloads. As competition increases and resource constraints deepen, a hybrid-use infrastructure could provide new flexibility for scaling. The arrangement highlights the evolving dynamics of the AI hardware landscape, where companies like Google are leveraging years of investment in both software and custom silicon. For OpenAI, the addition of Google as a chip supplier broadens the ecosystem around its technology stack and addresses growing concerns over availability and cost of compute resources.

        "content": "The full article continues below these offers from our partners. Holding a cash cushion is always a smart move. But in today\u2019s climate of economic uncertainty, driven by President Donald Trump\u2019sshifting tariff policies, a cash reserve can feel more essential than ever. Whether you\u2019re building savings in a bank account or shifting funds out of more volatile investments, it\u2019s worth asking: how hard is your cash working? Different cash strategies offer different yields, and choosing the right one can have a real financial impact. Fortunately for savers, today\u2019s options remain highly appealing, with returns still supported by theFederal Reserve'selevated benchmark interest rate. And that favorable backdrop could stick around a while longer. According to theCME Group's FedWatch Tool, financial markets currently see more than an 80% chance that the Fed won\u2019t issue its first rate cut until the Sept. 17 meeting. That\u2019s good news for savers, since the rates offered by banks, credit unions, and brokerages tend to closely track thefederal funds rate. When the Fed lowers that benchmark, yields on savings, money market, and CD accounts typically decline as well. For a low-risk return that\u2019s still rewarding, today\u2019s top cash investment options fall into three main categories: You can choose a single option or mix and match based on your goals and timeline. Either way, it\u2019s essential to know what each one is currently paying. Below, we break down the top rates in each category as of Friday\u2019s market close, along with how they\u2019ve changed since last week. The rates below represent the top nationally availableannual percentage yields (APYs)from federally insured banks and credit unions, based on our daily analysis of more than 200 institutions offering products nationwide. Note that savings and money market account ratesare variable, meaning the bank can lower them at any time. In contrast, CD rates are fixed and guaranteed for the full term of the certificate. The yield on money market funds fluctuates daily, while rates on cash management accounts are more fixed but can be adjusted at any time. Treasury securities pay interestthrough maturityand can be purchasedbought from TreasuryDirector traded on the secondary market through a bank or brokerage. I bonds must be bought from TreasuryDirect and can be held for up to 30 years, with rates adjusted every six months. Here's a summary look at all of the cash vehicles above, sorted by today's highest rates. Note that the rates shown are the top qualifying rate for each product type. Savings Accounts The most basic place to stash cash is a bank or credit union savings account\u2014sometimes called ahigh-yield savings account\u2014that lets you add and withdraw money as you please. But don't assume your primary bank pays a competitive rate. Some banks pay virtually zero interest. Fortunately, our daily ranking of the best high-yield savings accounts gives you more than 20 options thatpay 4.30% to 5.00% APY. Note, however, that savings account rates can change at any time. Money Market Accounts Amoney market accountis a savings account that lets you write paper checks. If this is a useful feature to you, compare thebest money market accounts. If you don't need paper check-writing, choose whichever account type\u2014money market or savings\u2014pays the better rate. Thetop money market account rateis currently 4.37%. Again, be aware that money market rates are variable, so they can be lowered without warning. Certificates of Deposit Acertificate of deposit (CD)is a bank or credit union product with a fixed interest rate that promises a guaranteed return for a set period of time. Generally ranging from 3 months to 5 years, CDs offer a predictable return with a rate that cannot be changed for the duration of the term. But be aware that it's a commitment with teeth: If you cash in before maturity, your earnings will be dinged with an early withdrawal penalty. Our daily ranking of the best nationwide CDs currently includes 14 options paying at least 4.50%\u2014with atop rate of 4.60% APY. Money Market Funds Unlike a money market account at a bank,money marketfundsare mutual funds invested in cash and offered bybrokerageandrobo-advisorfirms. Their yields can fluctuate daily but currently range from 3.94% to 4.21% at the three biggest brokerages. Cash Management Accounts For uninvested cash held at abrokerageorrobo-advisor, you can have the funds \"swept\" into a cash management account where they will earn a return. Unlike money market funds, cash management accounts offer a specific interest rate that the brokerage or robo-advisor can adjust whenever it likes. Currently, several popular brokers are paying 3.83% to 4.00% APY on their cash accounts. Treasury Bills, Notes, and Bonds TheU.S. Treasuryoffers a wide array of short- and long-term bond instruments. Treasury bills have the shortest duration, ranging from 4 to 52 weeks, while Treasury notes have a maturity of 2 to 5 years. The longest-term option is a Treasury bond, which has a 20- or 30-year maturity. Today's rates on the various Treasury products range from 4.19% to 4.85%. You canbuy T-bills, notes, and bondsstraight fromTreasuryDirector buy and sell them on the secondary market at brokerages and banks.Selling a Treasury product allows you to exit before the bond matures. However, you may pay a fee or commission for secondary market purchases and sales, while buying and redeeming at TreasuryDirect\u2014the U.S. Treasury\u2019s online platform for buying federal government securities\u2014has no fees. You can also buy Treasury ETFs, which trade on the market like a stock. Treasury ETFs have advantages and limitations, which youcan read about here. I Bonds U.S. TreasuryI bondshave a rate that's adjusted every six months to align with inflation trends.You can redeem an I bond anytime after one year or hold it for as long as 30 years. While you own the bond, your rate will change every six months. I bond rates just went up on May 1, from 3.11% for bonds issued during the previous six months to 3.98% for new bonds purchased between May 1 and Oct. 31, 2025. ForexistingI bond holders, your next six-month rate will also increase\u2014by almost a full percentage point. See our story aboutthe recent rate change, including rate tables for different bond dates. Every business day, Investopedia tracks the rate data of more than 200 banks and credit unions that offer CDs and savings accounts to customers nationwide and determines daily rankings of the top-paying accounts. To qualify for our lists, the institution must be federally insured (FDICfor banks,NCUAfor credit unions), and the account's minimum initial deposit must not exceed $25,000. It also cannot specify amaximumdeposit amount that's below $5,000. Banks must be available in at least 40 states to qualify as nationally available. And while some credit unions require you to donate to a specific charity or association to become a member if you don't meet other eligibility criteria (e.g., you don't live in a certain area or work in a certain kind of job), we exclude credit unions whose donation requirement is $40 or more.

        "content": "(Reuters) -OpenAI has recently begun renting Google's artificial intelligence chips to power ChatGPT and its other products, a source close to the matter told Reuters on Friday. The ChatGPT maker is one of the largest purchasers of Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs), using the AI chips to train models and also for inference computing, a process in which an AI model uses its trained knowledge to make predictions or decisions based on new information. OpenAI planned to add Google Cloud service to meet its growing needs for computing capacity, Reuters had exclusively reported earlier this month, marking a surprising collaboration between two prominent competitors in the AI sector. For Google, the deal comes as it is expanding external availability of its in-house tensor processing units (TPUs), which were historically reserved for internal use. That helped Google win customers including Big Tech player Apple as well as startups like Anthropic and Safe Superintelligence, two ChatGPT-maker competitors launched by former OpenAI leaders. The move to rent Google's TPUs signals the first time OpenAI has used non-Nvidia chips meaningfully and shows the Sam Altman-led company's shift away from relying on backer Microsoft's data centers. It could potentially boost TPUs as a cheaper alternative to Nvidia's GPUs, according to the Information, which reported the development earlier. OpenAI hopes the TPUs, which it rents through Google Cloud, will help lower the cost of inference, according to the report. However, Google, an OpenAI competitor in the AI race, is not renting its most powerful TPUs to its rival, The Information said, citing a Google Cloud employee. Google declined to comment while OpenAI did not immediately respond to Reuters when contacted. Google's addition of OpenAI to its customer list shows how the tech giant has capitalized on its in-house AI technology from hardware to software to accelerate the growth of its cloud business.

        "header": "Did Nvidia Just Say \"Checkmate\" to AMD?",
        "content": "Over the last two years, semiconductor powerhouseNvidia(NVDA1.74%)has emerged as the biggest force fueling the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. The company's industry-leading graphics processing units (GPU) andCUDA software platformhave helped Nvidia build a substantial lead over its competition in the chip market. WhileAdvanced Micro Deviceshas carved out an impressive pocket for itself in the AI data center landscape, recent reporting suggests that the company is still far behind Nvidia. Let's explore the dynamics behind Nvidia's lead over AMD, and assess if the king of the chip realm just made its checkmate move against its top rival. During the early phases of the AI megatrend, Nvidia benefited from having afirst-mover advantageover other semiconductor companies when it comes to GPUs specifically. While being a first mover can help companies experience outsized growth relative to the competition or form strategic partnerships with leaders in adjacent industries, there's no guarantee that these businesses can sustain their leads. In the case of Nvidia, however, trends suggest that company's lead over AMD may only be getting bigger. Beth Kindig, who serves as a technology research analyst and CEO of I/O Fund, recently shared a data point from SemiAnalysis that pointed out that Nvidia's market share in AI accelerators increased by roughly two points during the first quarter -- now hovering around 88%. By contrast, AMD's share shrunk by about one point, now comprising roughly 4% of the market. Image source: Getty Images. The chart illustrates AMD's revenue and operating income by reportable segment during the first quarter. One of the more notable takeaways is thatAMD's data center operationis its fastest-growing business, all while remaining highly profitable. Data source: AMD investor relations. However, a more subtle idea is that sales from the data center business shrunk by 5% quarter over quarter. To be fair, there could be a number of reasons for this. First, the semiconductor industry is cyclical -- which makes quarterly trends tougher to predict and gauge when it comes to the overall health of the business. In addition,AMD's latest accelerator architecturesare expected to ship later this year. This timeline could be playing a role in the slight deceleration of the data center business compared to the fourth quarter. While these ideas may make some sense in theory, I find them hard to believe, given Nvidia actuallygainedground in the AI accelerator market during the first quarter. Since AI developers raced to buyNvidia's newest Blackwell chips, factors such as cyclicality or new competitive chipsets from AMD didn't seem to be enough to persuade customers from waiting on AMD's products over those of Nvidia. In the long run, these dynamics could spell trouble for AMD. Despite the company's ability to win impressive data center customers such asOracle,Meta Platforms, andMicrosoft, AMD's innovative efforts do not appear to be enough to outmaneuver Nvidia at this time. As of this writing (June 25), shares of AMD have risen by 18% so far in 2025. Per the chart, these gains are slightly ahead of Nvidia stock's increase.  NVDAdata byYCharts I think it's hard to justify AMD's gains over Nvidia, given the company's lack of market share and apparent decelerating growth (at least for now). While I suspect AMD's growth profile could turn around following the release of new chipsets during the second half of the year, I also think it will be challenging for the company to gain any meaningful momentum back from Nvidia -- as Nvidia also has new architectures releasing later this year, too. To me, Nvidia may have put AMD in a checkmate position for the time being. I think these figures reported could imply that Nvidia will remain the leader in AI data center chips and could be on its way to a new, prolonged, and sustained wave of growth.",

        "content": "The country\u2019s biggest banks can comfortably stay afloat if a severe recession hits due to their sizable cushions, the Federal Reserve said in its latest health check on the industry. Theannual stress testsdesign a nasty scenario for the economy and examine whether big banks could survive it\u2014without the need for government help, as in 2008. The latest results showed that banks such as JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, and Bank of America could comfortably withstand those blows and keep lending to households and businesses. \"Large banks remain well capitalized and resilient to a range of severe outcomes,\u201d Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman said in a press release. This year's scenario was a little easier than in 2024, but it featured a brutal recession nonetheless. The Fed tested banks\u2019 resilience under an unemployment rate that peaked at 10%, stock prices falling 50% and a roughly 30% drop in housing prices and commercial real estate values. That hypothetical recession would inflict losses of $550 billion on the 22 banks the Fed tested, as credit card users, businesses and other borrowers default on their loans. However, all those banks would maintain cushions far above the minimum levels the Fed requires. Onekey ratiothe Fed uses to determine whether banks have enough capital would drop to 11.6% across the industry in its scenario, down from 13.4% at the end of 2024. But that is far above the minimum requirement of 4.5%. Other banks the Fed reviewed this year include lenders such as PNC Financial Services, Capital One Financial, U.S. Bancorp, M&T Bank and Truist Financial. The exams also include major Wall Street banks such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, as well as the U.S. branches of several big foreign banks. The Financial Services Forum said in a statement the results \u201cconfirm the strong capital positions of the largest U.S. banks,\u201d which have stayed resilient in the annual tests after more than a decade. But Better Markets, an advocacy group that seeks stronger regulations, said that the tests' 100% track record shows they are \u201cstressless, ineffective and endanger all Americans\u201d by improperly measuring banks\u2019 risks to a downturn. The results come as the Fed weighs a proposal to make banks\u2019 yearly results less volatile and other changes that are likely to be industry-friendly. Banks have long argued the Fed\u2019s process is opaque and subject to unpredictable results, making banks less able to lend. However, criticssay some opaqueness is precisely the point\u2014since it makes the tests rigorous and limits banks\u2019 ability to find workarounds. Trade groups sued the Fed in December over the issue, a battle that\u2019s since been paused now that the Fed is weighing changes to the annual exams.The Fed was partly hamstrung by a Supreme Court case last summer, which reined in federal regulatory agencies\u2019 power. On Friday, the Fed reiterated that it \u201cintends to improve the transparency of the stress test process\u201d by disclosing models to determine banks\u2019 losses ahead of time. The agency says it would lead to valuable feedback that could improve whether the tests will adequately gauge risks. The regulator is also proposing to reduce year-to-year volatility of stress test results by averaging out outcomes over two years.",
