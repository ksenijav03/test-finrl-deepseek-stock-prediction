        "content": "Over the last year, a quantum-computing-themed fund called theDefiance Quantum ETFhas rocketed by 41%. Among some of the biggest contributors to these gains are popular quantum computing stocks such as IonQ, whose shares have soared by 394% over the last year -- as well asRigetti ComputingandD-Wave Quantum, both of which have witnessed share price gains in excess of 1,000%. With such robust returns, these three red-hotquantum computing stocksmight seem like no-brainers. Nevertheless, I have another company on my radar that I think will outperform these stocks in the long run. Let's explore howNvidia(NVDA0.87%)is starting to emerge as an interesting opportunity in the quantum computing landscape. More importantly, I'll detail why the company is my top pick in the space and assess if the stock is a good buy right now. Nvidia reports its revenue into five major buckets: data center, gaming, professional visualization, automotive, and other. Today, nearly 90% of the company's revenue stems from the data center segment. This makes sense, as cloud hyperscalers such asMicrosoft,Alphabet, andAmazon, as well as other major AI developers, includingMeta PlatformsandOracle, have been on a relentless buying spree for Nvidia's chips over the last couple of years as they continue investing in data center infrastructure. What investors may not realize, however, is that Nvidia isn't just a hardware company. It also has a thriving software unit that integrates tightly with the GPU business. The company'sCUDA programmingplatform complements the chip business -- essentially creating an ecosystem of AI-powered software and hardware. This tight integration provides Nvidia with a competitive advantage over the competition, making it challenging for customers to switch to alternative platforms. This savvy business model has put Nvidia ahead of the pack when it comes to being the vendor of choice for generative AI development. Nvidia is already parlaying the CUDA application to quantum computing, aptly naming the program CUDA-Q. Let's explore why Nvidia's pursuit of quantum computing could be a lucrative move for the company. Image source: Getty Images. While Nvidia maintains a sizable lead over its competition in the chip landscape, I am concerned that semiconductors are becoming increasinglycommoditized. Many of Nvidia's own customers are investing in custom silicon solutions. Meanwhile,Advanced Micro Devicescontinues to show impressive innovation with its own GPU architectures. I see the rise of quantum computing as an opportunity for Nvidia to diversify its business beyond AI data centers. Moreover, I think continuing to offer additional software applications through CUDA should help Nvidia maintain a healthy profit margin profile -- especially as the chip landscape begins to experience more competitive forces. As I write this (June 16), Nvidia is trading at aforward price-to-earnings(P/E) ratio of 33.7. This isn't exactly dirt cheap. For reference, the average forward P/E across theS&P 500is around 22. What I am more focused on are the broader trends across Nvidia's valuation.  NVDA PE Ratio (Forward)data byYCharts Per the chart above, Nvidia's forward P/E multiple experienced notable contraction throughout most of this year. While Nvidia recovered from the initial decline back in January following theDeepSeeksaga, the stock took another, more prolonged hit around April -- during the time of the President's initial tariff announcements. As investors can see, though, Nvidia has been experiencing somevaluation expansionover the last month or so following a solid first-quarter earnings report, in combination with some net positives on the tariff negotiation front. Yet even with the recent buying, Nvidia remains a much cheaper stock today than it was a year ago based on forward P/E trends. While there is some momentum fueling the share price right now, I would still encourage investors to consider scooping up shares. Overall, Nvidia stock looks reasonably valued. Furthermore, with yet anothermultibillion-dollar market in the form of quantum computingrepresenting an opportunity for the company to maintain its lead over the competition, the long-run narrative around Nvidia remains compelling.",

        "content": "Investors have piled into artificial intelligence (AI) stocks over the past couple of years, especially big names such as AI chip leaderNvidiaor cloud giantAmazon. Though these companies have helped shareholders score a major win quarter after quarter and could continue to climb, some investors now are looking beyond these names that have constantly been on center stage. They aim to find the next big AI success story, and one that has emerged in recent times isCoreWeave(CRWV-0.29%). This tech company is new to the market, having launched its initial public offering in March, and the stock already has soared more than 320% from that point. Investors are excited about this new AI investing opportunity, especially considering the company has been delivering triple-digit revenue growth. Could investing $10,000 in CoreWeave make you a millionaire? Let's find out. Image source: Getty Images. So, first, let's talk a little bit about this new-to-the-market company that's outperformed well-established tech giants such as theMagnificent Sevencompanies so far this year. CoreWeave actually is closely linked to the world's most talked-about AI company, Nvidia, and this may be part of the reason why investors are so excited about its future. This company's main business is offering customers access to its giant fleet -- 250,000 to be exact -- of Nvidia chips across more than 30 data centers. These graphics processing units (GPUs) may be rented for long periods of time or simply by hour, offering customers great flexibility for their AI workloads. Since demand has been extremely high, even surpassing supply, for Nvidia's latest Blackwell architecture and chip, investors clearly are optimistic about CoreWeave's prospects too. CoreWeave even was the first to make this new architecture generally available to customers, highlighting its ability to serve customers fast with the latest innovations. And the fact thatmarket giant Nvidiaholds a 7% stake in CoreWeave is another element that could appeal to investors. Nvidia's backing suggests this young company is set to play a key role in the next phases of the AI story. A look at CoreWeave's growth so far shows great momentum, with revenue soaring more than 400% in the first quarter. And even considering uncertainties in recent months that have pressured the stock market, CoreWeave says customer demand still increased. In fact, the big challenge right now is to scale up and meet demand. This requires significant investment, and that means investors should expect spending to increase moving forward. Of course, CoreWeave faces competition from traditional cloud service providers, but the company stands out because it truly specializes in handling AI workloads, and doing this at scale. This could work to CoreWeave's advantage as demand forcompute-intense inferencingaccelerates. Now, let's get back to our question: Could investing $10,000 in CoreWeave make you a millionaire? It's clear that CoreWeave offers an interesting growth story at the moment, and even after its spectacular gains could make a compelling buy for long-term growth investors who can handle some risk. But even if CoreWeave goes on to climb 1,000% over the coming years, as tech companies have been known to do, your $10,000 would reach $110,000. This would be fantastic, but it's far from $1 million. Before making any investment decisions, though, it's important to keep in mind that you shouldn't count on any one stock to make you a millionaire. It's extremely rare to succeed this way, and even worse, it's high risk. You have a much better chance of reaching the $1 million mark, and avoiding disastrous losses, if you invest in a diversified portfolio of quality stocks. So, for example, if $10,000 is your investing budget, split this amount across several stocks and at least a few industries. And the great news is you can apply the same technique with any amount. Now, in this context, a purchase of CoreWeave couldhelp youalong the road to wealth and even eventually nudge your portfolio toward the value of $1 million.",

        "content": "There has never been a $5 trillion company. The closest companies to reaching that milestone areMicrosoft(MSFT0.41%)andNvidia(NVDA0.87%). Both companies have market capitalizations of around $3.5 trillion. Using their current growth trajectories as a guide, they could reach that $5 trillion mark in a few years. But which one will get there first? The signs point to Nvidia, based on its impressive growth and the increasing market for its products. Although Nvidia has made investors a boatload of money over the past few years, there's still plenty ahead, making it an attractive stock to own right now. Here's why Nvidia has the potential to be the first $5 trillion company by 2028. Image source: Getty Images. Nvidia's rise goes hand-in-hand with the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and the rise of data centers that help process AI computations. AI hyperscalers (large-scale cloud service providers that offer massive computing resources, storage, and networking infrastructure) like Microsoft are racing to install as much equipment as possible to run AI workloads. That way, they can profit from the various companies running AI on their servers by charging usage fees. While multiple companies are pursuing this approach, Nvidia is the main supplier of the graphics processing units (GPUs) central to their operation. And while there are alternatives to Nvidia's products, it has a 90% or greater share in thedata center GPUmarket, similar toAlphabet's dominance in the search engine industry (through Google). This helps put Nvidia's dominance into perspective. Even better, the demand for data centers is growing far quicker than the growth in Search. Nearly every AI hyperscaler has announced record data center capital expenditures in 2025. Planning, developing, and constructing the sites on which these centers are built takes years, so this heightened spending will persist for multiple years. A third-party estimate Nvidia cited during its 2025 GTC event said global data center spending was $400 billion in 2024, but it is expected to rise to $1 trillion by 2028. For reference, during FY 2025 (which encompasses most of 2024), Nvidia's data center division delivered $115 billion in revenue. So, for every $100 spent on data centers, about $29 went to Nvidia. What will this mean for Nvidia in the future? Let's take a conservative approach to these growth estimates. Say data center capital expenditures only rise to $800 billion, and Nvidia's share of that revenue falls from 29% to 25%. If that happens, Nvidia will still make about $160 billion in revenue from data centers alone in 2028. In FY 2025, Nvidia's non-data center divisions produced $16 billion in revenue. Assuming other divisions won't grow and combined with the projected data center revenue, we'd get $216 billion. That's a 46% gain from today's revenue levels.  Data byYCharts. If Nvidia's market cap were increased by the corresponding projected revenue growth, it would be $5.03 trillion. Certain caveats to this argument exist, like what happens if Nvidia's margins slip or if its valuation decreases substantially. However, we've already built in some of that by removing some market share and lowering the total dollar figure of data center build-outs. I think Nvidia will be the first company to cross the $5 trillion threshold, and it will likely do so in the next few years. Nvidia's potential is still rising, and investors should ensure that they're invested in thistop-notch AI play for the foreseeable future.",

        "header": "Could AMD Finally Challenge Nvidia With Its MI400 AI Chips?",
        "content": "Advanced Micro Devices(AMD-0.20%)has built a sizable AI accelerator business over the past few years, but it's a drop in the bucket compared with market leaderNvidia(NVDA0.87%). While Nvidia's data center segment generated more than $39 billion in revenue during the most recent quarter alone, AMD managedjust $5 billion in AI accelerator revenuein all of 2024. AMD's latest Instinct MI350X and MI355X graphics processing units (GPUs) are powerful, delivering four times the AI compute performance and 35 times theAI inferencingperformance compared to the company's last-generation products. However, specifications and performance are in line with Nvidia's latest Blackwell-based GPUs. AMD's chips feature 288 GB of HBM3E memory and 8 terabytes per second (TB/s) of memory bandwidth, the same as Nvidia's GB300 Superchip. Raw compute performance across different types of operations is also similar to Nvidia's latest. While AMD's MI350X and MI355X are capable AI accelerators, they fail to leapfrog Nvidia. Image source: Getty Images. In 2026, AMD will release its next-generation MI400 series AI accelerators. The company claims that the flagship MI400X will be 10 times more powerful than the MI300X, an enormous leap in just a few years. The chips will feature up to 432 GB of HBM4 memory, 19.6 TB/s memory bandwidth, and significant increases in raw computing performance. Of course, Nvidia won't be sitting still. Nvidia's Vera Rubin chips are expected to ship in the second half of 2026, bringing significant performance gains over Blackwell. The initial Rubin AI accelerator will keep memory per GPU at 288 GB but up the bandwidth to 13 TB/s, while Rubin Ultra in the second half of 2027 pile on additional memory and bandwidth. Rubin is expected to more than triple compute performance over its predecessor. While companies' claims about the performance of future products should be taken with a grain of salt, AMD's MI400X looks like it will be a solid contender when it launches in 2026. It should beat Nvidia's current generation of products handily in terms of performance, although Nvidia's next-gen Rubin chips may ultimately win out. One advantage AMD will have is memory, with the MI400X set to offer more capacity and bandwidth than Rubin. For certain types of workloads, that will be appealing. In addition to MI400 family, AMD is planning to launch a new rack-scale AI solution called Helios in 2026. Helios will feature up to 72 MI400 GPUs, Venice EPYC server CPUs with up to 256 cores, and AMD's next-generation Vulcano AI network interface card to enable fast data transfer in high-density clusters. Rack-scale solutions are becoming more popular among AI infrastructure companies as they face challenges building out large enough clusters to handle the latest AI models, and Helios should be a compelling option when it launches. While AMD will have far more powerful AI accelerators and a new rack-scale AI solution in 2026, Nvidia will probably remain the overwhelming market leader. Not only is Nvidia's hardware powerful, but the company's CUDA software ecosystem provides a critical competitive advantage. AMD is attempting to build out its own ecosystem with ROCm, and the latest version brings increased performance and new features to the platform. However, AMD continues to fight an uphill battle. AMD sees the market for AI chips reaching $500 billion by 2028. With annual AI accelerator revenue at just $5 billion for 2024, the company doesn't need to beat Nvidia to vastly grow its AI chip business over the next few years. More powerful AI chips will help, as will a more fleshed-out rack-scale solution that should appeal to the largest customers of AI accelerators. With the MI400 series and Helios slated for 2026, AMD is positioned to grow its AI-related revenue substantially over the next few years. But just like in the gaming GPU business, the company is almost certain to remain in a distant second place behind Nvidia.",

The sell-off came despite the fact that the commentary did not mention Pop Mart by name. The warning stoked fears of a regulatory crackdown on the blind-box model, a sales strategy in which consumers purchase toys without knowing which character they will receive. Pop Mart\u2019s success has been built largely on this model, fuelling a frenzy among collectors and driving a nearly 170% rally in its shares so far this year. Stocks:Create your watchlist and portfolio Much of that surge has been driven by the popularity of the company\u2019s signature Labubu dolls \u2014 wide-eyed, toothy monster figurines that have become a cult hit among young Chinese consumers. Despite this week\u2019s losses, Pop Mart remains the top performer on the MSCI China Index year-to-date. Analysts have continued to raise price targets, citing the growing strength of the company\u2019s intellectual property and brand-driven appeal. Shares in Snowflake (SNOW) were higher ahead of the US opening bell as Canaccord Genuity reaffirmed its bullish stance on the cloud-based data platform. Analyst Kingsley Crane reaffirmed a Buy rating on the stock and maintained a price target of $220, citing Snowflake\u2019s efforts to simplify data access and expand usability across organisations. Crane also pointed to the company\u2019s growing commitment to open data standards and its recent acquisition of Crunchy Data as evidence of a broader strategy to embed itself within open-source and AI environments.

Analysts expect the company to report earnings of $0.26 per share for the current quarter, a 44.4% increase from a year earlier, according to estimates compiled byZachs Equity Research. For the full fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate stands at $1.06 per share, suggesting annual growth of 27.7%. Snowflake, which provides cloud-native data warehousing and analytics tools, has been steadily building out its AI and machine learning capabilities as enterprise customers increasingly look for ways to leverage large datasets in real time. Shares in Salesforce (CRM) edged lower in pre-market trading on Friday, extending a 1% decline in the previous session, after the company announced a fresh round of price increases for several of its core cloud products. The CRM giant said it will raise prices by an average of 6% on its Enterprise and Unlimited editions of Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, Field Service, and certain \u201cIndustries Clouds\u201d effective 1 August. The company clarified that prices for its Starter, Pro, and Foundations editions will remain unchanged. \u201cThese increases reflect the significant ongoing innovation and customer value delivered through our products. There are no planned changes to pricing for Salesforce Foundations, Starter, or Pro Editions,\u201d the company said in a statement. The announcement marks Salesforce\u2019s second price increase in less than two years. In 2023, the company implemented an almost 10% rise, its first list price adjustment in seven years. Shares in Nvidia traded lower in pre-market trading on Friday, even as bullish commentary from analysts and mounting interest in sovereign artificial intelligence systems continued to fuel optimism around the AI chipmaker\u2019s long-term prospects. Barclays (BARC.L) analyst Tom O\u2019Malley raised the firm\u2019s price target on Nvidia from $170 to $200, maintaining an overweight rating, according to a research note cited byTheFly.com.The revised target implies a potential upside of 39% from current levels. The upgrade follows a supply chain check-in after Nvidia\u2019s first-quarter results, which led the bank to project a $2bn revenue upside for the July quarter compared with Wall Street expectations. Barclays also raised its forecast for Nvidia\u2019s Compute segment, which includes the company\u2019s flagship data centre GPUs, to $37bn from $35.6bn.

Oppenheimer also showed support for Nvidia\u2019s strategic direction, saying in a recent client briefing that the company is poised to benefit from growing global demand for sovereign AI systems. Following CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s high-profile tour of European capitals, the firm said Nvidia is working closely with national governments to help design and implement AI infrastructure. Oppenheimer estimates the total addressable market for sovereign AI could reach $1.5tn globally, with Europe alone representing $120bn of that opportunity.

        "header": "Could the \"Next Nvidia Stock\" Actually Be... Nvidia Stock?",
        "content": "Many articles have been written over the last year or so about \"the nextNvidia(NVDA0.12%)stock,\" which refers to a stock that has the potential to post incredibly strong gains over at least the medium term, just like theartificial intelligence(AI) chip leader has done. With the risk of sounding like I've lost my mind, I think there's a good case to be made that \"the next Nvidia stock\" could actually be Nvidia stock. In other words, there seems at least a solid probability that Nvidia stock still has not just good or even great butamazinggrowth potential left. Think of it as \"Nvidia the superstar stock 2.0.\" Image source: Getty Images. I say \"at the risk of sounding like I've lost my mind\" because I understand the law of large numbers strongly works against my thesis. This \"law\" basically means that the larger a company becomes, the more difficult it becomes to continue to grow revenue and earnings at a strong pace on a year-over-yearpercentagebasis. And year-over-year earnings (and cash flow) growth is what largely powers stock prices higher. Nvidia is massive. It has a market cap of $3.55 trillion, as of June 18, making it the world's second most valuable publicly traded company, trailingMicrosoftby just a sliver. Moreover, Nvidia management expects the company to generate revenue of $45 billion in its fiscal second quarter, which equates to an annual revenue run rate of $180 billion. To be clear -- I think it's highly unlikely that Nvidia will ever again be able to pump out a long consecutive string of year-over-year quarterly earnings growth in the very high double-digit to triple-digit percentages. But I don't think it has to do that in order to deliver stellar returns to investors for some time. Year-over-year earnings growth solidly in the double-digits plus a reasonable stock valuation should be all that's needed to keep investors very happy. What makes me have confidence in the \"reasonable valuation\" bit? Currently, Nvidia stock's valuationisreasonable by just about every measure, but that has not always been true. (For reference, it's trading at 25.4 times Wall Street's projected forward earnings per share, or EPS, as of June 18. That's an attractive valuation for a company that analysts expect will grow EPS at an average annual rate of 30% over the next five years.) The main reason I think the valuation will likely remain relatively reasonable (at least much of the time) for a while circles back to that law of large numbers. Wall Street analysts and many investors are well aware of this phenomenon, and I think most folks in both those groups will tend to continue tosignificantlyunderestimate Nvidia's future earnings growth potential due to thoughts like these: Consistent beliefs like these will help keep Nvidia stock's valuation reasonable in part because Wall Street analysts are going to tend to be too conservative in their estimates, in my view. Moreover, some investors will probably feel that Wall Street is being too liberal in their estimates because they themselves feel cautious given Nvidia's humongous size. Yes, this caution among many investors would likely slow down Nvidia stock's rise, but that's better than the stock frequently shooting up to unsustainable levels, only to plunge back down to Earth, in my opinion. This topic could be several articles, so here's just a brief list. 1. The company's now-annual cadence of launching new graphics processing unit (GPU) architectures for its products for its AI-accelerated data center, gaming, and other market platforms. Blackwell is its current architecture. 2. The approach of the widespread legalization of autonomous vehicles. Nvidia's GPUs will be the \"brains\" inside many of these vehicles. 3. The approach of the era ofhumanoid robots. Nvidia's GPUs will be the \"brains\" inside many of these robots. 4. The company will stay ahead of the innovation pack by entering emerging new technologies via organic growth and acquisitions. An example here isquantum computing, in which I think Nvidia will be increasingly involved.",

        "content": "By Wen-Yee Lee TAIPEI (Reuters) -Taiwan's Foxconn and U.S.artificial intelligencechips maker Nvidia are in talks to deploy humanoid robots at a new Foxconn factory in Houston that will produce Nvidia AI servers, two sources familiar with the matter said. This would be the first time that an Nvidia product will be made with the assistance of humanoid robots and would be Foxconn's first AI server factory to use them on a production line, the sources said. A deployment, expected to be finalised in the coming months, would mark a milestone in the adoption of the human-like robots that promises to transform manufacturing processes. Foxconn is developing its own humanoid robots with Nvidia and has also trialed humanoids made by China's UBTech. The sources said it was not clear what type of humanoid robots are being planned for use in the Houston factory, what they will look like or how many will be deployed initially. They said the two companies are aiming to have the humanoid robots at work by the first quarter of next year when Foxconn's new Houston factory will begin production of Nvidia's GB300 AI servers. And while it was not clear what exactly the robots will be doing at the factory, Foxconn has been training them to pick and place objects, insert cables and do assembly work, according to a company presentation in May. Foxconn's Houston factory was ideally suited to deploy humanoid robots because it will be new and have more space than other existing AI server manufacturing sites, one of the sources said. Nvidia and Foxconn declined to comment. The sources did not wish to be identified as they are not authorised to speak to the media. Leo Guo, general manager of the robotics business unit at Foxconn Industrial Internet, a subsidiary of Foxconn that is in charge of the group\u2019s AI server business, said last month at an industry event in Taipei that Foxconn plans to showcase at the company's annual technology event in November two versions of humanoid robots that it has developed. One of those will be with legs and the other will use a wheeled autonomous mobile robot (AMR) base, which would cost less than the version with legs, he said, without disclosing details. Nvidia announced in April that it planned to build AI supercomputer manufacturing factories in Texas, partnering with Foxconn in Houston and Wistron in Dallas. Both sites are expected to ramp up production within 12 to 15 months. For Nvidia, using humanoid robots in the manufacturing of its AI servers represents a further push into the technology as it already supplies humanoid makers with a platform they can use to build such robots. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang predicted in March that their wide use in manufacturing facilities was less than five years away. Automakers such as Germany's Mercedes-Benz and BMW have tested the use of humanoids on production lines, whileTeslais developing its own. China has also thrown its weight behind humanoids, betting that many factory tasks will eventually be performed by such robots.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- SoftBank Group Corp. founder Masayoshi Son is seeking to team up with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. to realize what could be his biggest bet yet \u2014 a trillion-dollar industrial complex in Arizona to build robots and artificial intelligence. Most Read from Bloomberg Security Concerns Hit Some of the World\u2019s \u2018Most Livable Cities\u2019 One Architect\u2019s Quest to Save Mumbai\u2019s Heritage From Disappearing JFK AirTrain Cuts Fares 50% This Summer to Lure Riders Off Roads NYC Congestion Toll Cuts Manhattan Gridlock by 25%, RPA Reports Taser-Maker Axon Triggers a NIMBY Backlash in its Hometown Son envisions a version of the vast manufacturing hub of China\u2019s Shenzhen that would bring back high-tech manufacturing to the US, according to people familiar with the billionaire\u2019s thinking. The park may comprise production lines for AI-powered industrial robots, they said, asking not to be named as the plan remains private. SoftBank officials are keen to have the Taiwanese maker of Nvidia Corp.\u2019s advanced AI chips play a prominent role in the project, although it\u2019s not clear what part Son sees for TSMC, which already plans to invest $165 billion in the US and has started mass production at its first Arizona factory. Nor is it clear that TSMC would be interested. A person familiar with the chipmaker\u2019s thinking said that SoftBank\u2019s project has no bearing on TSMC\u2019s plans in Phoenix. Codenamed \u201cProject Crystal Land,\u201d the Arizona complex represents the 67-year-old SoftBank chief\u2019s most ambitious attempt in a career that\u2019s spanned numerous bet-the-house bids, thousands-fold-returns and billions of dollars in losses. Son, who\u2019s often expressed disappointment in his own legacy, has repeatedly said he means to do everything he can to hurry AI development. SoftBank officials have spoken with federal and state government officials to discuss possible tax breaks for companies building factories or otherwise investing in the industrial park, including talks with US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, the people said. The Japanese billionaire is also personally sounding out interest among an array of tech companies, they said. The project has been floated to executives at South Korea\u2019s Samsung Electronics Co., they said. Shares of SoftBank rose 2.7% Friday. TSMC\u2019s stock price rose 1.9%, while Samsung\u2019s gained 0.5%. Representatives of SoftBank, TSMC and Samsung declined to comment. A Commerce Department spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. SoftBank\u2019s attempts to get businesses investing in a US industrial park follow signs that its campaign alongside ChatGPT maker OpenAI to raise hundreds of billions of dollars for US data centers is moving slower than initially expected. Crystal Land would need to address crucial details, such as whether there\u2019s demand and funding on par with its grandiose scale, to become reality. Son has pulled together a list of SoftBank Vision Fund portfolio companies that might take part in the Arizona manufacturing hub, the people said. SoftBank-backed startups working on robotics and automation technologies \u2014 such as Agile Robots SE \u2014 may set up production facilities at the industrial complex, they said. The plans are preliminary and feasibility hinges on support from the Trump administration and state officials. While the cost of the project as envisioned by Son may require as much as $1 trillion to execute \u2014 a sum previously reported by the Nikkei \u2014 the actual scale depends on interest from big technology companies. If successful, Son has floated building multiple cutting-edge industrial parks across the US. SoftBank is exploring the Arizona project as it also moves forward on plans to invest as much as $30 billion into OpenAI and plans a $6.5 billion acquisition of Ampere Computing LLC. It\u2019s also seeding money into the Stargate venture with OpenAI, Oracle Corp. and Abu Dhabi\u2019s MGX, although it aims to get the bulk of the money for building data centers around the world from outside investors. Those outlays come as SoftBank\u2019s cash stood at \u00a53.4 trillion ($23 billion) at the end of March. The Tokyo-based company has since tapped its T-Mobile US Inc. stake, selling roughly a quarter of what it held in March to raise $4.8 billion this month. SoftBank also has net assets valued at \u00a525.7 trillion, of which chip designer Arm Holdings Plc makes the single largest portion, allowing it to borrow billions more as needed. SoftBank\u2019s exploring project financing for Stargate data centers, a model that could be adapted to a big endeavor like Crystal Land. Common for large-scale infrastructure like oil or gas pipelines, the project finance template would allow the tech investor to raise funding on a project-by-project basis and require less money upfront. Son\u2019s restless search for growth has resulted in projects that proceed in fits and starts, making it difficult to gauge how committed he is to any one venture. The billionaire is often goaded by the desire to boost SoftBank\u2019s stock price and repay retail investors who\u2019ve held onto the company\u2019s shares from before the dot-com boom and bust, people close to the SoftBank chief have said. Many investors have waited for decades for the stock to regain dot-com bubble levels \u2014 something it\u2019s flirted with only a few times since 2020. What Bloomberg Intelligence Says Masayoshi Son\u2019s ambition to set up a trillion-dollar industrial complex in Arizona to build robots and AI could signal additional, aggressive investments, even after SoftBank announced deals exceeding $40 billion in OpenAI, Stargate and Ampere Computing. The plans are preliminary, but could require investments in startups to fund facilities at the industrial complex. SoftBank might need to monetize mature assets, as it did in a recent $4.8 billion sale of a stake in T-Mobile, to invest in riskier, unlisted firms. -Sharon Chen, analyst Click here for the research If Son\u2019s primary motivation is to clear the way for AI, it may be more cost-efficient to encourage partnerships that link manufacturing expertise with that of AI engineers and specialists in fields from medicine to robotics, and incubating smaller companies, according to Melissa Otto, head of research at Visible Alpha. But pouring cash into data centers may help lower the cost of developing AI applications and spur broader adoption, she said. \u201cHe\u2019s a long-term thinker, and he takes risks,\u201d Otto said. \u201cIt\u2019s just too early to tell.\u201d --With assistance from Debby Wu, Catherine Lucey, Yoolim Lee and Mayumi Negishi.

        "content": "Growth stocks can generate returns far superior to those of value stocks or dividend stocks in the long run. These are the types of companies that investors are drawn to because if they're growing, they are expanding their operations and likely innovating and potentially diversifying along the way. Names likeAmazonandNvidiaare two exceptional examples. Over the past 20 years, the former has produced returns of 12,000% while the latter is up more than 60,000%. Investing $30,000 into either one of the stocks back then would have made you millions of dollars. Picking the next biggrowth stockis easier said than done. But the good news is that you don't have to pick the next Amazon or Nvidia to achieve great results. TheInvesco QQQ Trust(QQQ-0.02%)is an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that will give you exposure to the top 100 nonfinancial stocks in theNasdaqexchange, also known as the Nasdaq 100. Amazon, Nvidia, and many other top tech names are included in that list. Here's how a $30,000 investment in the fund might grow over the long haul. Image source: Getty Images. The best growth stocks in the world are often found on the Nasdaq. And by targeting the top 100 nonfinancial companies, you won't have to worry about keeping an eye on which growth stocks to buy. The Invesco fund will adjust its holdings over time, removing poor-performing stocks and replacing them with rising stars. Some of the top holdings in the ETF today includeCostco Wholesale,Netflix, andBroadcom. While it is a tech-heavy fund (tech stocks account for 57% of its holdings), about 20% of the portfolio is also in consumer discretionary stocks, followed by smaller positions in other sectors. And more than 97% of the holdings are U.S. stocks, which can minimize your exposure to international markets. It's little surprise, with so much focus on growth, that the Invesco QQQ Trust widely outperformed theS&P 500over the past decade. At 430%, it has averaged a compound annual growth rate of more than 18%.  QQQ Total Return Leveldata byYCharts. As impressive as the Invesco ETF's returns have been over the past decade, they've also been skewed in recent years by a flurry of tech spending, which may not persist in the very long term. That's why it may be a good idea to scale back expectations of what its future returns may look like. Rather than 18%, perhaps closer to thelong-run average of 10% for the S&P 500might be appropriate. The table below shows what a $30,000 investment might grow to at varying rates after 30-plus years. Table and calculations by author. There's no way to know what growth rate the Invesco ETF will end up averaging, especially when you're looking at such a long period of time. But the big takeaway is that with the effects of compounding, you can potentially build up a significant portfolio simply by putting $30,000 into a top growth fund like the Invesco QQQ Trust and letting it sit. It's a perfect example of a buy-and-forget type of investment.",

        "content": "Nvidia(NVDA0.12%)andBroadcom(AVGO-0.34%)are the leading players in the artificial intelligence (AI) semiconductor space, with both chip designers being the dominant forces in their respective niches. Nvidia controls the market for data centergraphics processing units (GPUs), which has been thriving thanks to the need for massive computing power required to train AI models. Broadcom, on the other hand, commands the lion's share of the custom AI processor market, which has been gaining traction because ofAI inference. However, both stocks have witnessed divergent fortunes on the market in the past year, with Broadcom's gains of 45% significantly outpacing Nvidia's jump of 9%. Does this make Broadcom the better AI stock of the two? Let's find out. Image source: Getty Images. Broadcom's custom AI processors are in great demand right now as they are being deployed in huge numbers by cloud hyperscalers for AI inferencing (where a trained AI model draws conclusions based on new data). The company has three customers that are expected to deploy more than 1 million units each of its custom AI processors in their cloud clusters in 2027. That would be a big jump over the 30,000 units of its custom AI processors deployed in each cloud cluster by its customers last year. The reason its custom AI processors are in such great demand is because of their ability to perform the tasks they are designed for more efficiently when compared to GPUs, thereby lowering the operating cost. Reports suggest that the company's custom AI chips can be two to three times faster than GPUs, and they consume 30% less power. This is the reason hyperscalers such asMeta Platforms,Microsoft,Alphabet's Google,Amazon, and others have been building custom AI chips for their servers. And the number of customers using Broadcom's AI chips is likely to go up to seven from the current three. The chipmaker reportedly designs chips for Alphabet, Meta, and ByteDance at present, and there are indications that it could add the likes ofOracle, xAI, andSoftBankto its list as well. This potential expansion of the company's AI customer base could help it sustain its impressive 70% share of the custom AI processor market. This could pave the way for outstanding revenue growth in the long run considering that the custom AI chip market is expected to clock an annual growth rate of 32% through 2030. Not surprisingly, analysts have been ramping up Broadcom's revenue estimates for the next couple of fiscal years.  AVGO Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Yeardata byYCharts. So, Broadcom is likely to remain a top AI stock over the long run as it is building up a solid customer base and is on its way to making the most of the lucrative opportunity in custom AI chips thanks to its outstanding market share. But will that be enough to help its stock deliver more upside than Nvidia? While the popularity of custom chips sold by Broadcom to tackle AI workloads has been increasing, the demand for GPUs sold by Nvidia continues to remain strong as well. The company's latest quarterly report showed a 69% year-over-year increase in revenue to $44.1 billion. That was faster than the 20% increase in Broadcom's revenue in the previous quarter. And Nvidia's data center revenue increased 73% year over year thanks to the demand for its Blackwell AI chips. Broadcom's AI revenue growth, on the other hand, was relatively slower at 46%. So despite its larger revenue base, Nvidia is growing much faster than Broadcom. The reason Nvidia continues to be the dominant player in AI chips is because it has focused on improving the inference performance of its GPUs, which is helping its customers reduce operating costs. And itremains miles ahead of its rivalsin AI revenue, with a 90%-plus share in data center GPUs. This puts the company in a terrific position to sustain its impressive levels of growth for a long time to come. McKinsey is forecasting an investment of $5.2 trillion worldwide in AI data centers by 2030. That would leave abundant room for growth in the company's data center business from the previous fiscal year's level of $115 billion. This lucrative opportunity suggests why Nvidia is expected to match, or even exceed, Broadcom's projected growth.  NVDA Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year,data byYCharts. Moreover, Nvidia's AI opportunity isn't just limited to data centers. The company's gaming and AI personal computer (PC) business grew 42% year over year in the previous quarter. Its automotive business recorded a 72% sales increase. The adoption of AI is projected toincrease at a nice clipin both these markets, promising outstanding growth. AI has given Broadcom and Nvidia a lift. But the latter is the bigger beneficiary of the huge demand for AI chips in multiple end markets, while the former is just getting started. Also, as mentioned above, Nvidia's growth is better than Broadcom's even though the former is a much bigger company. What's more, Nvidia trades at a cheaper valuation than Broadcom even with its stronger growth.  AVGO PE Ratiodata byYCharts; PE = price to earnings. So, even though Broadcom stock may have outperformed Nvidia in the past year, the valuation and growth profile of the two companies suggests that the latter is a betterAI stockto buy right now. You can't go wrong with Broadcom, either, considering that it is scratching the surface of a huge opportunity in AI chips, but if you're looking to choose from one of these two AI stocks for your portfolio, Nvidia looks like the better option.",

        "header": "2 Vanguard ETFs That Can Turn $300 per Month Into Over $1 Million",
        "content": "Investing a regular amount of money into the stock market each month can be an excellent way to grow your savings and build up a portfolio that's eventually worth $1 million or more. But it can be challenging to do, especially since you have to ensure you can continue to afford making monthly investments, and then picking which investments to make with that money. Amid volatile economic conditions, that's no easy task. You can, however, simplify the process by going with some solid exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that can diversify your portfolio and set you up for some great growth opportunities in the future. A couple of low-cost Vanguard ETFs to consider for this purpose include theVanguard Growth Index Fund(VUG0.41%)and theVanguard Information Technology Index Fund(VGT0.46%). Here's why investing $300 per month into either one of these ETFs could put you on track to generating a $1 million portfolio in the future. Image source: Getty Images. The Vanguard Growth Index Fund is a great, growth-focused ETF you can add to your portfolio. It charges anexpense ratioof only 0.04%, which means you don't have to worry about high fees chipping away at your gains. What's attractive about this fund is that it focuses on large-cap growth stocks. These are the types of investments that can drive long-run returns for your portfolio and make the most of your money. Stocks such asTesla,Amazon, andNvidiaare all among its top-10 holdings. These are leaders within their respective industries, and their businesses are synonymous with growth. With more than 160 stocks in total, this is a well-diversified ETF to simply buy and hold. It also yields around 0.5%. Over the past decade, the ETF has achieved total returns (which include dividend payments) of approximately 327%. That averages out to a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15.6%. But for the sake of being conservative, let's assume that its returns will slow down given how hot the market has been in the past few years and how it's reaching record levels. If the ETF averages a return of about 10% for the very long haul (which is in line with theS&P 500's long-term average), then a $300 per-month investment could grow to more than $1 million after a period of 34 years. This would require investing in the ETF every month during that time frame. But by doing so, you can put yourself on a path to producing some fantastic returns thanks to the effects of compounding.  VUG Total Return Leveldata byYCharts. As terrific of a growth investment as the Vanguard Growth Index Fund has been in recent years, it still falls well short of the gains the Vanguard Information Technology Index Fund has produced during that stretch. At 543%, its 10-year total returns average out to an annual gain of 20.5%. That's a mind-boggling return, and it highlights just how impressive the stocks within this ETF have been. There will be some overlap between this fund and the growth ETF, but the big difference is there is heavier exposure to big tech. Nvidia,Microsoft, andAppleaccount for a combined 45% of the Vanguard Information Technology ETF's total holdings, but they make up just around 32% of the growth ETF. That difference can be substantial over time, especially given how well a massive stock like Nvidia has performed. In 10 years, its returns have been truly exceptional, totaling 28,000%. Given Nvidia's size today as one of the most valuable companies in the world, odds are its returns will be far more modest over the next decade. While they may still be great, it's probably a good idea to factor in a healthy dose of conservatism with this ETF as well given how much of a boost Nvidia has given it in the past. Even though the ETF is focused on tech and growth, averaging 20% annual returns likely isn't going to be sustainable over the very long haul. The expectation of a 10% return may also be prudent with this ETF to ensure your expectations aren't set too high for future gains. As with the growth ETF, if you invest $300 per month into this fund, you can also be on the path to a $1 million portfolio. If this ETF continues to outperform the market, however, then it may take less than 34 years to get to $1 million. But by staying the course and investing regularly into this or the growth ETF, you can be in a good position for building up a solid portfolio over the long haul. The Vanguard Information Technology ETF charges an expense ratio of 0.09%, and while that's a bit higher than the growth ETF's fees, they aren't going to drastically alter your prospects for generating potentially life-changing returns from regularly investing in this fund.",

        "content": "Long-term investing is the key to sustainable returns in the stock market because it smooths out short-term volatility to let a company's fundamentals shine through.Nvidia(NVDA0.12%)investors know this better than most. If they managed to hold through the ups and downs, they would have a return of almost 800% over the last three years. That said,generative artificial intelligence(AI) is no longer a brand-new industry that can maintain itself off of hype. Costs will need to fall, and consumer-facing AI software companies will need to develop more-compelling monetization strategies. Let's explore what the near future might hold for Nvidia and this burgeoning industry as a whole. The market reacted well to Nvidia's first-quarter earnings (shares are up 7% since they were released on May 28). But the results were a mix of good and bad news. Revenue jumped 69% year over year to $44.1 billion, but this is a sharp deceleration from the corresponding period last year when sales grew by 262%. There are several reasons for this weakness. For starters, the Trump administration severely restricted\u00a0 export of the company's H20 chips to China, leading to a $4.5 billion impairment charge as it had to write down the value of excess inventory and purchase agreements. And while overall AI chip demand is still huge, there are some early signs that its specific business model could eventually hit a plateau. More and more companies are investing in custom-built chips that can be cheaper and more efficient than the company's one-size-fits-all solutions for specific workloads.Amazonhas its Trainium and Inferentia chips, whileAlphabethas its Tensor processing units (TPUs) designed to rival Nvidia'sgraphics processing unit(GPU) technology. OpenAI is also working with the chipmaker's key supplier,Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, to potentially reduce its reliance on Nvidia's hardware. Image source: Getty Images. As the AI industry becomes more mature, companies will probably seek competitive advantages through custom hardware design. And while Nvidia's powerful chip remains crucial in the nascent stages of the industry, it is unclear how much longer its economic moat will last. Nvidia's biggest customers could potentially become its rivals in AI chip design, giving them an incentive to replace its products wherever possible and making it crucial for the company to find business outside the private sector. Management is doing exactly that. The company is pioneering a concept it calls sovereign AI, which suggests that different parts of the world need to build their ownlarge language models(LLMs) to serve their unique historical, cultural, and political realities instead of relying on centralized sources -- typically in the U.S. While these efforts are still in their early stages, Reuters reports a positive reaction from many European leaders and new data center build-outs in France and Germany with local partners. The company is also making progress in the Middle East, where it is working with a Saudi Arabian government-backed AI start-up called Humain to build Nvidia-powered AI data centers in the desert kingdom. Over the long term, national governments could become a stable and reliable source for the business' chip design, even as the private sector becomes more competitive. Nvidia seems to be in that complicated place where it is transitioning away from being an explosive growth stock into a mature value stock. With aforward price-to-earnings ratioof just 33, shares look reasonably priced, assuming the expansion of sovereign AI helps counteract the likely plateauing of the company's private-sector chip business. And over the next three years, investors should expect slower but steady expansion.",

This video was recorded on April 24, 2025 Ricky Mulvey:Berkshire Hathawayis sitting on more cash than any company in history. You're listening. It's Motley Fool Money. I'm Ricky Mulvey joined today by Matt Argersinger. Matt, thanks for being here. Matt Argersinger:Hey. Great to be here, Ricky. Ricky Mulvey:Good to have you on a day where we're getting some home sales data. As I was looking through the headlines this morning, I got three headlines that, all of which seem to be telling different stories. From CNBC. Home sales last month dropped to their slowest march pace since 2009. From Bloomberg, US new home sales top all estimates on surge in the South. From the Wall Street Journal, home sales in March fell about six percent biggest drop since 2022. Which one are you buying here? Matt Argersinger:I'm going to buy the CNBC headline only because I love data points that go back way long in time. The fact that we're at the slowest sales pace since 2009, I mean, remember from a moment where we were in 2009. That's right. In the midst of a global financial crisis caused in part by a housing crash. If you're telling me that we're at the slowest pace of home sales since that period of time, that's going to get my attention. I'm definitely buying the CNBC version of this story. Ricky Mulvey:Also pointing out that it's the March 1. We're only doing every March from this year. There's a little bit of trickiness within the way they're positioning this. I want to dig into this Wall Street Journal commentary though, which is that so far this spring supply is increasing faster than demand. The inventory of homes for sale is rising because some sellers who have been waiting for mortgage rates to fall have decided that they can't keep waiting. This is a big difference. I'm thinking about during the pandemic, being in a neighborhood in Cincinnati while I'm watching streams of people trying to look at one existing home and offers are getting taken off the marketplace instantly. This is one data point, Matt, but is this an inflecting point? Is this one data point? What are you seeing here? Matt Argersinger:No, I hate to say that. But I think it's one data point. Yes, inventories were up 20% year over year. Probably a good sign. But remember, this data largely reflects contracts that were signed in January and February before we had all these tariff developments. People thin were probably a lot more certain and less worried about the economy than they are today. I think sadly, the data could actually inflect downward Ricky, because you have to remember the situation we're in. We still have millions of homeowners. We're locked into long term fixed mortgage rates under 5%, under 4%, in many cases, under 3%. If mortgage rates are still above 6.5% right now, which they are, I still think the vast majority of sellers are willing to wait longer, especially now if they feel even more uncertain about the economy. I feel like, yes, we've got this rise in inventory data for March, but I don't think it's Dick's. I think we're probably still in a situation where less inventories come to the market and sellers are still in this frozen mode. Ricky Mulvey:Maybe two very different markets for existing homes and also new homes. On this coming Monday's show, I'm going to dive into some specific Home Builders with Anthony Shavon. But for now, there's a pretty odd disconnect going on with this where the data for March is showing that purchases of new single-family homes rose 7.4%. You mentioned home sellers being hesitant to leave. Home construction is still happening. You look at a company likeD. R. Horton. This is the country's largest home builder and they recently reported they're telling a very different story. In their latest earnings call, sales dipped, the company's lowering sales guidance. There's a lot of questions for these Home Builders, specifically around tariffs as you mentioned. Also, worth mentioning, a lot of the people that are involved in new home construction Matt, are immigrants and that's going to be a challenge for these Home Builders. On the one side of this specific data point, you see a macro trend way more purchases of new single family homes and yet the country's largest home builder is saying, we're selling fewer homes and we expect that trend to continue. Makes sense of that. What's going on? Matt Argersinger:It does feel paradoxical, in a way. But you have to remember, the new home sale side of the housing market pie so to speak, is very small. But it's important and I think the fact that Home Builders for the most part, have kept building throughout this whole period and have kept selling homes is important. But when I see the new home sales data, what I think it tells me is more about the demand side of the equation, which we know to be strong. We've got the biggest generation of first time home buyers in history. Ricky, I think that's you. But millennials who are desperately in a lot of cases trying to buy homes and they just can't because there's really no inventory despite the small rise that we saw in March. I think that generation, by the way, like previous generations is largely unfazed by mortgage rates. I think they understand the situation they're in. They just want a home. They're getting a job, they're moving to someplace. They'd love to be able to buy a home and not rent a home. But I think on the Home Builder side, so to take D. R. Horton side, you're pushing discounts to move inventory right now. You know mortgage rates are expensive, financing is hard to get. To get deals done, you have to do discounts which hurts your sales. At the same time, you mentioned you got higher labor costs, you've got higher input costs. You now have a lot of uncertainty about the economy and what these tariffs are going to do to your business. You're putting less shovels into the ground. You're probably pushing off new development, holding that land a little bit longer than you want to. I wouldn't say this number is a blip. I think it's important that new home sales are up for the month, but I don't think it's telling the whole story about the demand and supply problem that we still have and I tend to buy what D. R. Horton is saying. New home sales are probably going to be heading in the wrong direction for the time being. Ricky Mulvey:I'm out in Denver and the rental market still significantly different than buying a home out here right now. I'll be staying in the rental market for maybe a year or two, Matt. Let's move on to Chipotle Earnings. They reported yesterday after the bell. Matt, the big story is the comp sales decline, comparable sales for Chipotle dropping about half a percent. This is the first drop since COVID and also coming off a heater, a five ish percent rise from last quarter. CEO Scott Boatwright, very quick to mention that this could be a weather problem and a macro problem, you never love seeing a CEO immediately going after the weather in the first few sentences of a call. But that's what they're going for. Are you agreeing with what they're selling here? Matt Argersinger:I will buy the macro story there, Ricky. I don't know about the weather angle. I don't know about you. I still buy burritos, even if it's rainy or cold out. But yeah, the macro story is something. If you look at what Chipotle did last year, mid to high single digit comps every quarter, they did over 7% in comps for all 2024. The negative comp this quarter was definitely a shocker, especially because Chipotle had been really holding its own. I mean, if you look at other restaurant brands, includingStarbucks, which I think serves a similar demographic, I mean, they were already seeing coms fall off the table by last summer, where Chipotle really held its own. But I think it's this slowly leaking economy that we're seeing. It's lower consumer spending, it's lower consumer confidence and I think that's finally catching up even with the Chipotles of the world. Look, I think it's actually going to get a little worse going forward. I think management said they expect things to improve by the second half. They expect comps to be positive overall for the year. But you have to remember what they did last year. Look at COMMS Q2 of last year up 11.2%. That just shows you how tough the comparisons are going to get this year. Especially now that there's this elevated level of uncertainty among its customers which they said bled into April. I expect July's results when we get them will be pretty challenging. I think if you're a Chipotle shareholder, you certainly have to anticipate that growth this year is going to be a lot slower than it was last year. A lot of the growth is really just going to come on the revenue side, is just going to come from new store openings. It's not going to really come from the comp side. If you look at Chipotle's stock price, yes, it's down roughly 30% from its all time high. That's a big drop. I'm a shareholder. That hasn't felt good, but it still trades at a very rich valuation. This year's results certainly aren't going to support that any longer. Hopefully, this is a situation where 2026 is the year when things really turn around. Ricky Mulvey:I want to start seeing management credit the weather when things are going well for them. Weather is only a problem. It's only a headwind. You never hear a CEO saying, who's really nice out this spring and we saw more people coming in. Yes. Few other parts of the business results and I think it is worth mentioning why this stock trades at such a rich premium is that even with this decline in comparable sales, these are incredibly profitable businesses. Later in the call, they're mentioning that the year two cash on cash returns for a new restaurant. A restaurant that's been open a little bit is 60%, for older restaurants, it's 80%. You follow the commercial real estate market. I mean, that is blowing the socks off any office building, retail establishment. These are still incredibly strong businesses. Sales still growing six percent to about three billion dollars and they're still opening new restaurants, 57 new restaurants open in the quarter. What else in the business results stood out to you? Matt Argersinger:No, I mean, that was certainly it. Those returns cash on cash returns for store openings, it's incredible. That's why I believe the story when management says we can ultimately have 7,000 stores. I mean, of course, you're going to open that many stores if they can be this profitable. Yeah, having them observed real estate, other retail businesses, I mean, they're hoping for cash on cash returns in the high single digits, maybe low double digits so they can get it. Sixty percent in year two, that's extraordinary. Ricky Mulvey:There's a Wall Street Journal column earlier this month that had the unfortunate title of your new lunch habit is hurting the economy. There's a few key points here that I think relate to Chipotle. One of which is that the number of lunches bought outside the home were lower in 2024 than in 2020, in the height of the pandemic. Also going out to lunch right now is just stupid expensive. Hybrid office workers spending about $21 on lunch in 2024. That was up from 16 bucks in 2023. That research coming from a video conferencing company called Owl Labs. Shout out to them for finding out the cost of lunch. I still think there's a version where Chipotle wins in this environment, where people are tightening their spending, but I still want to go out to eat. If I go to Chipotle, I can get a steak bowl for about $11.50. I'm not getting the 20% tip screen. There's some headwinds here, but this is still really affordable compared to a lot of their competitors, Matt. Matt Argersinger:It is. I mean, I think of Chipotle as high quality food at a reasonable price. I think that works no matter what happens to the economy. But I have to say Ricky, lunch is stupid expensive. If I could share one anecdote, I just recently helped my wife and son move up to New York City. They're spending the spring and summer there and we rented an apartment, and I was helping the move in. Of course, when you're moving in, people get hungry, you don't have any food, you haven't been in the grocery store. I made the mistake of ordering from Uber Eats, three sandwiches from a local deli, $55 for the sandwiches. Uber Eats fees plus tip, I was close to 80 bucks for lunch for three people. Ricky Mulvey:What are you putting in the sandwiches? Matt Argersinger:I mean, they were good sandwiches. One was a meatball, one was a turkey. I think the other one was roast beef. I mean, they were good, $80 good? I'm not so sure. Ricky Mulvey:Yeah, we're seeing a similar thing in Denver and what I've noticed is sometimes the mains are still all right but now it's like a bag of chips. It's three bucks and then we're adding on more of the toast tipping environment. It makes it very unaffordable very quickly. Let's move on to this Berkshire story. Lot of Wall Street Journal today. I promise I read other news outlets. This is a column from Spencer Jacob, which I thought was good. It was actually sent to us from a listener named Chris pointing out that the annual Berkshire meeting is coming in less than two weeks. There's a question for shareholders, which is what is Uncle Warren going to do with all that cash? Right now, Berkshire Hathaway is sitting on more cash than any company ever in history including Berkshire Hathaway. It's about $318 billion. This is how he got there. He's collecting a lot of the cash dividends that the businesses send him. Also, he sold about $80 billion worth ofApplestock back in 2024. To be clear, Berkshire still has about $174 billion worth of Apple stock, so not a complete sale, but trimming some of the winners. I think the first thing people may be wondering, is this a macro signal? Is Warren Buffett battening down the hatches to buy up a bunch of stuff if the market turns south? Are you taking this cash pile as a macro signal? Matt Argersinger:I've tried to reason my way through this a few different ways. Warren is 94-years-old. Is this just him being very conservative with the time he has left? No. First of all, he's always invested with a long term mindset. He did that through his 70s, 80s when most of us would be at that point in our lives, 100% in bonds or treasuries. He was still taking risks with equities so I don't think that's the answer. I think he's probably investing like he's going to live on 20 years. But relatedly, could it be succession planning? After all, we've known since about 2021 that Greg Abel is going to be taking Buffett's place. Is he just setting up Abel with a lot of cash, a clean slate when it comes to allocating Burch's capital? No, I don't think that could be the answer either. I think if Buffett saw a compelling investment or acquisition opportunity, he'd make it probably regardless of what Abel or anyone thinks. He's certainly proven that over time. Is it because he's lost faith in the direction of the country and therefore the US economy and maybe therefore US corporate profits? No. I mean, Buffett is the ultimate optimist. We know this when it comes to the future of the US and that's regardless of who may currently be in the White House. I can't help but conclude Ricky, that I think this is actually macro sickling. I mean, forget the investments for a moment. Berkshire the corporation has 200 billion in net cash. Take all the cash, take out all the debt, and it still has over 200 billion. That's up from 35 billion a year ago. If you go back a little over two years ago, they actually had net debt of about seven billion. In a little over two years, they've gone from a net debt position to over 200 billion in net cash. I do think Buffett is making a market call here. You remember, one of his favorite market valuation tools is the market cap GDP ratio. It's often called the Buffett indicator for good reason, but it's the total market capitalization of a country stock, US, relative to its gross domestic product. He said in the past, when that ratio is above 100%, the market is overvalued when it's below 100%, that might suggest undervaluation. Depending on what source you use and how you calculate the US total market cap of stocks here, that ratio was over 200% coming into the year. That was at or near a record high. It's actually higher than it was in the peak of the dot-com boom. I'm finally here. I think the evidence is undeniable that Buffett thinks or thought that valuations were expensive, and he was preparing Berkshire Hathaway for just that. Ricky Mulvey:It's not that he can only shoot with what is it? He can only shoot with an elephant gun. When you have that much cash, your only option is to take companies private or you're looking atCoca ColaorAmerican Express, you don't think it's that. Matt Argersinger:No. I would say it's him being patient. I think he does see a lot of clouds on the horizon. I think there's probably storms ahead, not just for US stocks, but I think for the US economy. I think Buffett believes that. You mentioned the elephant gun. He wants to make 50, 60, $70 billion blasts with first year's capital. The only way he's going to be able to do that if there are big dislocations in the market. I do think he thinks or expects there might be in the near future and that's why he's going. Ricky Mulvey:We'll keep watching. We'll see what happens. The annual Berkshire meeting less than two weeks. Matt Argersinger, thanks for being here. Appreciate your time and insight. Matt Argersinger:Thanks, Ricky. Ricky Mulvey:Up next, Mary Long and Asit Sharma continue their conversation about AMD and how macroeconomic forces are impacting the chipmaker. Mary Long:Asit a big ongoing news story that's a subsection of the tariff story has been how changing export rules have affected semiconductor stocks, in particular, how they've affectedNvidiaand AMD. Last week, US government changed its export rules for certain chips last week, particularly those that are going to China. This was a big news for Nvidia which warned of a $5.5 billion write off as a result of that rule change. AMD was hit by those changes too. We on the show have already talked about the impact of that $5.5 billion write off on Nvidia. But while I have you I want to focus on what that might mean for AMD. This company is racing for closer to an $800 million impact as a result of these rule changes. Help us understand this a bit better. These rule changes impact AMD's MI308 chip. Numbers, letters, you and I talk a lot about names. What does that chip actually do? How is it different from AMD's other chip offerings? It's MI400 offerings, for example. Asit Sharma:Yeah, so the MI308 chips are, as you suggest, basically pared down versions of AMD's latest GPU series accelerators that go in data centers. They're purpose made for this market and the interesting thing Mary, is that 2025 was supposed to be the launch year for these. They have been in prototype and the R&D phase so we didn't see a lot of sales to China in GPUs from AMD last year. This was going to be the beginning of a pretty nice opportunity. If we can translate that $800 million that the company has signaled, it's going to take us right down on inventory and work in process and translate that to revenue, probably it means about 1-$2 billion in revenue each year. Now, as a function of $31 billion in estimated revenue for 2025. That's not a huge chunk. Let's say it's going to land somewhere between four and 6% of total revenue this year. But it's really about the Ford opportunity. What the US is doing, in essence and this is not just on the Trump administration. It started with the Biden administration, but the US is increasingly putting up barriers for its greatest companies that develop AI technology like Nvidia, like AMD, making it harder for them to play in what, in essence, is the world's fastest growing market or market of most demand for these chips. The companies have been working around export controls for some time. They already understand they can't sell their most capable accelerators into China. But here we have a situation where, look even the pare down versions aren't going to be able to gain the required export licenses and hence, AMD and Nvidia are getting shut out of a market even on the lower end. Mary Long:Where exactly in the production process were these MI308 chips? Were they designed but not yet built? Were they built, and there's already orders for them? Is there a stockpile of these designed manufactured chips that AMD thought it was going to be able to deliver to China that now is just going to sit there, or they're going to have to find another market for or is this more theoretical revenue that they were planning on that they have to find another way to generate? Asit Sharma:Well, I think your question beautifully illustrates what we read in the very brief description, the 8K filing that AMD released, which is to say they're hinting that it's inventory, it's prototypes, it's some capitalized R&D, and it's some product that was ready to change hands. It's really a mix of everything, but we do know from that press release that some of it was inventory. This was stuff that was already developed, probably waiting to be shipped. Total cost of all of this including some of the prototyping and investment is about 800 million. Not a huge hit for AMD when all is said and done. But really, again, to come back to this point that it is taking some future opportunity off the books. Mary Long:How much does that subtraction of future opportunity change or impact your overarching thesis for AMD? Do you view this as materially impactful to the company? Upon hearing this news, the stock market reacted like, hey, this is a big deal to both what it meant for Nvidia and AMD. How does Asit Sharma react to that news? Asit Sharma:Yeah, same way as the market, Mary. You rerate the multiple on the company to adjust for that lost opportunity. But again, you mentioned the company has good business in China. Last year, it was about 25% of revenue that AMD derived from China, 6.23 billion. But most of this was in server chips, chips that found their way into desktop computers, gaming computers. There is a whole ecosystem of chips that are below the radar of US regulators that AMD is selling in China, those really aren't going to be impacted. The impact on my thesis isn't material. I have the same view of this as I have of Nvidia is that the demand for generative AI technology and the ability to just serve up inference and also train new models is going to be huge for a long time even as we see innovations come out of China and they will because we are forcing China to innovate. These two companies will still have a lot of white space to play in, so they'll make it up elsewhere over time. Near term though, there is, of course, that little bit of rerating on the stock. It was down, I think five or 6% on the news the day that they had their press release. Mary Long:There's another branch of this that I want to touch on. It plays less to the changing export rules story, but more to the geopolitical situation, trade war situation more broadly. CEO of AMD, Lisa Su announced that the company will be producing key processor units in the United States for the first time. Historically, AMD has relied on manufacturers likeTaiwan Semiconductorto build its chips. Historically, TSMC's manufacturing has taken place in you guessed it, Taiwan. Now though, TSMC has a new production facility in Arizona in the US and so more manufacturing will be able to take place stateside. The timing of this announcement, it was pretty recent. The timing of it makes it very easy to assume that, this movement, this change, this is the result of President Trump's trade war and the recent push for American manufacturing. But in actuality, these plans have been in place for a long time. Let's put the tariff situation aside for a moment. Big hypothetical, but let's just do that for the sake of conversation. What does making its chips in America mean for AMD on a cost basis? Again, putting the larger ever changing tariff situation aside for the moment. Asit Sharma:I think it's a net positive on a cost basis. You would say glancing at this proposition how could it cost AMD less to have chips manufactured in the US versus Taiwan? Even though those chips have to be shipped over assembled in different components and pieces. Well, the answer is there's some opportunity cost here that plays into AMD's calculations. What if supply chains get disruptive? What if there's an earthquake in Taiwan which is a key risk that's always been there with TSMC. What if China invades Taiwan? That's always been a key risk. For AMD, on a long term basis for its supply, when it extrapolates costs of the chips themselves to its operating margin which you and I have been talking about, it makes sense to start having some of those chips made here. I think this is a big win for TSMC, because TSMC, for a long time itself didn't believe that it could be able to manufacture chips outside of Taiwan because they have such a specialised engineering workforce there. The Taiwanese, the engineers there, work incredible hours relative not just to the United States, but other parts of Asia. I mean, these are specialized engineers who work very hard and it's extremely complex to make this advanced chip packaging. But TSMC has surprised itself. It's branched out into South Korea, it's branched out into Japan. It's branched out into Germany. It's branched out into Arizona of all places, and they are looking to have smaller and smaller node processes out of that Arizona facility which is a boon for TSMC, but it's also a boon for AMD because then that cost proposition doesn't look so bad. If it's a little more expensive to make it here in the US, well, you'll take that trade if you're AMD. Look, in a tariffs world, it makes even more sense. I think Lisa Su is feeling pretty good about those commitments and the decision to try to bring some of that manufacturing here and participate with TSMC. As a shareholder, I'm all for it. Mary Long:We'll leave it there because Shocker Asit, I believe you and I are out of time, but always a pleasure. Thanks so much for shining a light on this company and how it exists in the ever changing geopolitical landscape. Asit Sharma:Thanks a lot for having me, Mary. Always happy to talk AMD.

        "content": "NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is one of the10 AI Stocks Getting Wall Street\u2019s Attention.On June 17, analyst Thomas O\u2019Malley at Barclays raised his price target on the stock from $170 to $200 while maintaining an \u201cOverweight\u201d rating. The new target reflects significant upside potential for Nvidia in the second half of the year, backed by robust demand across the company\u2019s supply chain. The rating affirmation asserts that Barclays continues to feel optimistic about NVIDIA\u2019s market potential and performance trajectory. Conducting checks with the supply chain after first-quarter earnings, the firm has identified approximately \u201c$2 billion in upside in July for Nvidia vs. Street numbers.\u201d This has led to a lift in its full-year Compute revenue estimate to $37 billion from $35.6 billion. Even though Blackwell\u2019s capacity at an estimated 30,000 wafers per month in June fell short of the firm\u2019s expectations of 40,000 wafers, the firm asserted that \u201cutilizations are healthy, and the supply chain sounds positive on the 2H of the year.\u201d Meanwhile, Blackwell Ultra is on track, and its mass production is scheduled for the third quarter. According to analysts, \u201cboth Ultra and higher volume should help gross margins (GMs) in the 2H.\u201d The firm has therefore revised its Compute revenue forecasts for the third and fourth calendar quarters to $42 billion and $48 billion, respectively. This is above its prior projections and the Street consensus. \u201cEven with the recent run, this name has the most potential upside in our coverage for the 2H and we raise our PT to $200.\u201d -Analysts led by Tom O\u2019Malley.

        "header": "US Prepares Action Targeting Allies\u2019 Chip Plants in China (WSJ)",
        "content": "By Liza Lin, Amrith Ramkumar and Raffaele Huang  (Wall Street Journal) -- A U.S. official told top global semiconductor makers he wanted to revoke waivers they have used to access American technology in China, people familiar with the matter said, a move that could inflame trade tensions.  Currently, South Korea's Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix as well as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing enjoy blanket waivers that allow them to ship American chip-making equipment to their factories in China without applying for a separate license each time.  Jeffrey Kessler, head of the unit in charge of export controls at the Commerce Department, told the three companies this week he wanted to cancel those waivers, according to people familiar with the meetings. They said Kessler described the action as part of the Trump administration's crackdown on critical U.S. technology going to China.  If carried out, the move could be disruptive both diplomatically and economically. Earlier this month, the U.S. and China agreed to a fragile trade truce in London. Part of the deal involved each country agreeing to hold off from introducing new export controls and other measures designed to hurt the other.  The action isn't a new trade escalation but would be designed to make the licensing system for chip equipment similar to what China has in place for rare-earth materials, White House officials said. The U.S. and China continue to make progress on completing the agreement they reached in London and negotiating on trade, they said.  \"Chip makers will still be able to operate in China. The new enforcement mechanisms on chips mirror licensing requirements that apply to other semiconductor companies that export to China and ensure the United States has an equal and reciprocal process,\" a Commerce Department spokesman said.  A new step making it harder for global chip makers to operate in China might still strike Beijing as a betrayal of the London deal. It could also strain the relationship between Washington and friendly governments in South Korea and Taiwan, whose companies would be most affected and have promised large investments in the U.S. in recent years.  The Chinese factories in question -- including a Samsung memory-chip factory in the Chinese city of Xi'an -- are part of the global supply chain for memory, logic and other chips. While they generally don't have the most advanced technology, the factories' output is widely used in cars, consumer electronics and the like.  Industry officials said tighter curbs by Washington wouldn't immediately force the factories to shut down, but over time, they could find it harder to operate effectively. That would disrupt global industry as companies are dealing with other issues triggered by the U.S.-China trade war, such as China's limits on exports of rare-earth magnets.  The chip makers would likely seek case-by-case licenses from the U.S. government to supply their Chinese factories, while looking to replace U.S. equipment with alternatives from Japan and Europe.  People involved in the discussions said revoking the waivers isn't a done deal.  They said Kessler's unit -- the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security -- hasn't secured buy-in from other parts of the U.S. government, such as the Defense Department. Opponents in the administration worry eliminating the waivers would ultimately end up boosting Chinese companies and give China control of the plants.  Kessler and other national-security hawks have taken a hard line on cutting off China from American technologies, arguing that aggressive measures are needed to limit the country's advances in critical sectors and spur development of supply chains outside China. Those efforts have put them in conflict with pro-business officials.  In recent weeks, the administration has halted sales to China of more high-end chips from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices. That has dented the U.S. companies' revenue by billions of dollars. Commerce also weighed broad restrictions on sales of semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China, although a White House official said that move was no longer under consideration.  The South Korean and Taiwanese companies have notified authorities in their home regions about the waiver issue, hoping for help lobbying against the move, people familiar with the discussions said.  Both South Korea and Taiwan are negotiating broader trade deals with Washington, part of a wave of agreements the Trump administration hopes to wrap up in the coming weeks.  The companies see their Chinese factories as important for competing against Chinese rivals, which are looking to win more global business as chip suppliers. Samsung's current U.S. waiver has allowed its Xi'an plant to make some advanced products that compete against China's Yangtze Memory Technologies, among others.  South Korea, a U.S. military ally, and Taiwan have worked with the U.S. in its technology race with China, including by limiting transfer of advanced technology to China. TSMC, Samsung and SK Hynix have all made multibillion-dollar investments in U.S. factories with backing from Washington.",

        "content": "TerraPower, the nuclear startup founded and backed by Bill Gates, announced a new $650 million funding round this week. The investment will help the company build its first commercial power plant. Like other nuclear startups, TerraPower has been riding awave of interestfrom hyperscalers, data center developers, and now chip designers. Nvidia\u2019s venture arm, NVentures, participated in the round, marking its first energy investment. Bill Gates and HD Hyundai, both already on the cap table, also invested. TerraPower started building its first power plant in Wyoming in June 2024. The company doesn\u2019t have approval for the reactor itself, though it expects to receive permits sometime next year. Given the Trump administration\u2019s benign attitude toward nuclear, that timeline seems reasonable. When complete, TerraPower\u2019s first reactor will generate 345 megawatts of electricity, striking a middle ground between today\u2019s massive conventional reactors and tomorrow\u2019s promised small modular reactors. TerraPower\u2019s Natrium reactors are cooled not by water but by molten sodium. The Natrium design uses far more sodium than is required to cool the reactor. That\u2019s by design: When demand is low, the reactor can continue operating, heating sodium that is then stored in large tanks. When demand rises again, the steam turbines can draw heat from the stored sodium. Because nuclear power plants don\u2019t easily ramp up and down, this allows the Natrium reactors to continue operating at a steady state. The storage system is designed to produce up to 500 megawatts of electricity for more than five hours, helping to fill gaps in solar and wind generation. The startup previously pursued a different reactor design, which it hoped to complete by the mid-2020s. But after uncertainties mounted, it changed course to pursue the current Natrium design. TerraPower claims it can complete a reactor within three years after the first batch of concrete is poured for the reactor. Still, considerable site preparation and construction needs to happen before that occurs. And while there are signs that the first Natrium reactor will be cheaper than recent U.S. reactors, it won\u2019t be cheap: The Associated Press reported last year that the bill could reach$4 billion, half of which could be shouldered by the Department of Energy.",

Earnings from Q1 2026 showed significant growth, with sales jumping to $44 billion, potentially supporting this move. Meanwhile, market fluctuations, including geopolitical tensions and oil price shifts, had little sustained impact. The company's push into AI and strategic partnerships aligns with prevailing trends boosting tech stock valuations. You should learn about the 1 weakness we've spotted with NVIDIA. Rare earth metals are an input to most high-tech devices, military and defence systems and electric vehicles. The global race is on to secure supply of these critical minerals. Beat the pack to uncover the 24 best rare earth metal stocks of the very few that mine this essential strategic resource. NVIDIA's collaboration with Tech Soft 3D to enhance its Universal Scene Description and Omniverse platform may bolster its positioning in 3D technology, which can feed into the narrative of its broader growth strategy across the data center and AI workloads. The partnership supports NVIDIA's push into AI and could potentially lead to increased demand and adoption of NVIDIA's AI capabilities, further boosting revenue projections from this sector. Over the past five years, NVIDIA's total shareholder return, including share price appreciation and dividends, was very large, highlighting significant long-term growth. In comparison, over the past year, NVIDIA's performance exceeded that of the US Semiconductor industry, showcasing resilience and strong positioning in the market. The partnership with major players like Toyota and Uber also highlights potential revenue streams from expanding into the automotive sector, which aligns with the Blackwell architecture's capabilities. In terms of financial forecasts, the news may positively impact future revenue and earnings estimates as NVIDIA leverages its advancements in AI and GPU technology to capitalize on growing market demands. With a current share price around $113.54, compared to the analyst consensus price target of $163.12, there remains a significant discount to the anticipated valuation. This indicates potential upside as the company navigates challenges such as U.S. regulatory issues and production costs associated with its next-gen systems. Investors may view these developments as steps towards sustaining growth and profitability in emerging markets. According our valuation report, there's an indication that NVIDIA's share price might be on the expensive side.

        "content": "Tesla's (TSLA)market capitalization, currently hovering just over $1 trillion, could start down the road to doubling in value by the end of 2026 if its robotaxi launch goes well this weekend, Wedbush analysts led by Dan Ives wrote Friday. Keeping their \"outperform\" rating and Street-high $500 price target, Ives and his colleagues wrote Friday that they \"believe the march to a $2 trillion valuation for TSLA over the next 12 to 18 months has now begun in our view with [Full Self-Driving] and autonomous penetration of Tesla's installed base and the acceleration of Cybercab in the US representing the golden goose.\" Tesla CEO Elon Musksaid last weekthat the company was tentatively targeting a June 22 launch for its robotaxi program in Austin, Texas. The analysts said invites have been sent out \"giving selected Tesla users permission to use the Model Y Robotaxi service starting on Sunday.\" Musk has said the plan is to start with 10 to 20 Model Y vehicles carrying paying passengers fully autonomously around a specific, \"geo-fenced\" area of Austin. Tesla plans to eventually expand to more vehicles in several other cities, and allow Tesla owners to add their vehicle to an Uber (UBER)-like fleet, and startproducing the Cybercabwith no steering wheel or pedals next year. Also Friday, Tesla announced on Chinese social media service Weibo that it has signed an agreement to build its first grid-scale battery power plant in China. Bullish analystshave beeneager to shift focusfor Tesla stock to the robotaxi launch and away from Musk'spublic split with President Donald Trumpearlier this month, while more bearish analysts have said the feud couldcomplicate the company's regulatory path. Earlier this week, a group of Texas lawmakers sent Tesla a letter asking the EV maker to pause its robotaxi launch until a new version of its autonomous vehicle regulations go into effect at the start of September. Tesla shares rose less than 1% in recent trading to about $324. They are down about 20% on the year, but have recovered most of the ground lost as Musk and Trump traded online barbs earlier this month.",

        "content": "After stocks fell sharply earlier this year as new tariffs were rolled out, the average American households' net worth fell for the first time in almost two years. Many, but not all of them, are expected to bounce back as the worst of the tariffs have been paused or rolled back. The Federal Reserve said last week that householdnet worthdecreased to $169.3 trillion in the first quarter of 2025.That's a $1.6 trillion drop, and the first decline since the second quarter of 2023. Household net worth was at a record high in 2024's fourth quarter. The majority of this decline is likely attributed to thedrop in stock valuesafter President Donald Trump'stariff announcementsworried investors and consumers. TheS&P 500, a key indicator of how well American companies and their stocks are doing, fell by almost 20% from February to April. However, after Trumppulled back or temporarily paused the most extreme tariffs, the S&P bounced back and now stands only 1.5% below its peak in February. The market's recovery should helpthe roughly 60% of householdsthat hold stocks recover a portion of their net worth in the second quarter, said Priscilla Thiagamoorthy, senior economist at BMO Bank. However, Thiagamoorthy said lower- and middle-income households are less likely to see a significant gain in their net worth as the stock market improves. \"Lower- and middle-income families have far less invested in the stock market compared to the ultra wealthy,\" Thiagamoorthy said. \"Higher stock values push up net worth, but these households aren\u2019t experiencing that wealth effect in the same way.\" Additionally, Thiagamoorthy said lower- and middle-income households\u00a0still feel pinched by food inflation, which remains relatively high, since they typically spend a larger share of their income on groceries.",

        "content": "US stocks closed the session mixed on Friday as investors navigated a flurry of developments across multiple fronts. A Fed governor floated the possibility of interest rate cuts by July, and President Trump put off a decision on whether he would authorize a US strike in Iran. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose just above the flatline. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) slipped 0.2%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell 0.5%. All three major averages were little changed for the shortened holiday trading week. Chip stocks took a hit on Friday after a Wall Street Journal reportindicated the US wants to revokewaivers from top global semiconductor manufacturers used for accessing American technology in China. Nvidia (NVDA) fell around 1.1%. Meanwhile, Trump has introduced aself-imposed two-week time limiton deciding whether to enter the Middle East conflict, via a message relayed on Thursday by the White House press secretary. While the move added another layer of uncertainty to an already cautious market, it also opened a window for diplomacy to persuade Iran to negotiate \u2014 an idea itspresident rejected stronglyon Friday. Eyes are now onEuropean efforts to get Iranback to the table and avert further escalation in tensions. Foreign ministers from France, the UK, and Germany held talks in Geneva with their Iranian counterpart. Meanwhile, Fed governor Chris Waller on Fridayfloatedthe possibility of rate cuts in July, arguing recent inflation data has been tame even amid the introduction of Trump's tariffs. The central bank held interest rates steady this week, and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterated that policymakers are not rushing to ease, leading to a fresh attack from Trump. Waller's comments led to a slight uptick in bets on a July cut, though most traders are betting on the next cut coming in September, according to CME Group. Read more: The latest on Trump's tariffs Stocks closed out the shortened trading week mixed as investors eyed a two-week waiting period for President Trump's decision on whether the US would directly get involved in the Israel-Iran conflict and Fed officials gave mixed signals on their next policy move. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose just above the flat line. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) slipped about 0.2%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) dropped 0.5%. The Dow and Nasdaq Comp saw their least volatile week of 2025. Trump said he would decide on Iran within the next two weeks. Meanwhile, in an interview, Fed governor Chris Waller on Fridayfloatedthe possibility of rate cuts in July. However, Richmond Fed president Thomas Barkinsaid there is no rush to cut yet. Alphabet stock was on pace to end the week in the red as shares of the Google parent company sank more than 3% during Friday's session with tech broadly lower. The stock is down roughly 4% for the week. On Thursday, an adviser to Europe's highest courtsided with EUregulators in Google's fight against a record 4.34 billion euro ($4.98 billion) fine. Turkey has also launched an anti-trust investigation into Google. A recent Reuters report noted the company hasproposed more changesto its search results to better showcase rivals. Gold (GC=F) declined 0.3% on Friday after President Trump paused a decision over whether the US will become directly involved in the Israel-Iran conflict. The two-week timeframe to come to a decision on the matter has raised hopes of diplomacy. Gold is up nearly 30% this year amid increased demand for the precious metal from central banks and investors seeking out the safe haven as the US dollar (DX=F,DX-Y.NYB) index has weakened. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gave up session gains to fall below the flat line. The broad-based S&P 500 (^GSPC) and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) were also down. All three major averages were on pace to end the week in red territory on Friday as Israel and Iran entered their second week of fighting. Chip stocks were under pressure on Friday after a Wall Street Journal report indicated the US aims to rescind waivers that allow top global semiconductor makers to access American technology at their Chinese plants. Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith reports: Readmore here. Oil was on track to close out its third week of gains as investors awaited President Trump's decision on whether the US would directly intervene in the Israel-Iran conflict. West Texas Intermediate futures (CL=F) traded just below $75 per barrel, and Brent crude (BZ=F), the international benchmark, hovered near $76. WTI and Brent were up nearly 3% for the week after volatile sessions following the outbreak of the Israel-Iran conflict last Friday. Wall Street analysts have remained cautious on the recent rally. On Friday, Citi said its researchers \"see a lower risk of material energy flow disruptions from the conflict.\" \"Affecting the oil supply is not to the benefit of Iran or the US. In the event Iran\u2019s 1.1 mbpd of oil exports are disrupted,the team estimatesBrent prices could be $75\u201378/bbl \u2014 limited upside from current prices,\" wrote the analysts. Semiconductor stocks took a hit on Friday aftera Wall Street Journal reportindicated a top US official told top global semiconductor manufacturers he wants to rescind waivers used to access American technology in China. The move would once again inflame US-China trade tensions. Applied Materials (AMAT) and Lam Research (LRCX) both fell roughly 4%. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) and Broadcom (AVGO) also declined. Circle's (CRCL) massive rally shows no signs of cooling. The stablecoin issuer soared as much as 15% in early trading on Friday, extending its stunning post-IPO surge as Wall Street bets big on crypto\u2019s next major disruptor. \"Circle as a top-tier crypto 'disruptor' with a sizeable future opportunity,\" Seaport Research Partners analyst Jeff Cantwell wrote on Friday. \"On the back of an improving regulatory climate, we expect adoption globally of stablecoins such as USDC,\" he added. Cantwell initiated the stock with a Buy rating and a price target of $235 a share from Seaport Research Partners. During mid-morning trading on Friday, Circle stock hovered near $228. The move follows a surge of about 30% on Wednesday following the Senate's passage of the GENIUS Act, legislation that provides a federal framework for stablecoins, which are digital tokens backed by assets, such as the US dollar. US stocks rose on Friday following dovish comments from Fed Governor Chris Waller. Investors also digested President Trump's two-week deadline for deciding whether the US will directly get involved in the Israel-Iran conflict. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.3% while the broad-based S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained roughly 0.4%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose 0.4%. Oil prices fell after the White House said Trump would make his decision within two weeks, leaving room for diplomacy. Still, crude futures were on pace for a third week of gains. Dovish comments also sent stocks higher after Fed governor Chris Waller on CNBC's Squawk Box suggested that the Federal Reserve could move to lower interest rates in July. Waller said that any inflation from tariffs may be short-lived. US stock futures edged higher ahead of the opening bell, with contracts on the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) and S&P 500 (ES=F) rising roughly 0.3%, and those on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) adding 0.4%. The move higher followed dovish comments from Fed governor Chris Waller on CNBC's Squawk Box, suggesting that the Federal Reserve could move to lower interest rates in July. Waller argued that any inflation from tariffs may be short-lived. \"Any tariff inflation ... I don't think is going to be that big, and we should just look through it in terms of setting policy,\" Waller said. \"The data the last few months has been showing that trend inflation is looking pretty good ... We could do this as early as July.\" Read more here. Yahoo Finance'sBrooke DiPalmareports: Read more here.

        "content": "In a fast-growing segment likeartificial intelligence (AI), it's not always easy to spot bargains; however, they can be found. One of the best ways to find bargains in a hot sector is to look beyond stocks' price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios and instead look at theirprice/earnings-to-growth (PEG)ratios, as this metric takes into consideration their earnings growth. Stocks with PEGs under 1 are generally considered undervalued, and based on this metric, five of the best values in the AI space areAdvanced Micro Devices(AMD1.12%),Broadcom(AVGO-0.32%),Salesforce(CRM0.49%),Nvidia(NVDA-1.12%), andAdobe(ADBE-0.33%).  AMD PEG Ratio (Forward 1y)data byYCharts Let's look at why these bargain AI stocks could be great buys. With a forward PEG of only 0.2 based on its projected 2026 growth, AMD is one of the cheapest stocks in the AI space -- if it can live up to its growth expectations. The company has already been seeing solid growth, with its overall revenue climbing by 36% last quarter to $7.44 billion, while its data center segment revenue surged 57% to $3.7 billion. The growth is being led by the company's strong positioning within servercentral processing units (CPUs)and solid growth from itsgraphics processing units (GPUs). The former acts as the brain for computers, while the latter provides the processing power. While the market for CPUs is not nearly as robust as the one for GPUs in the data center space, it is still a nice, growing market, and AMD has been taking share. However, the company's biggest opportunity will come when the AI market shifts from training more towardinference, which is expected to eventually be the much larger market. Inference is less technically demanding than training AI models, and things such as latency, power consumption, and cost come much more into play. This should allow AMD to take some market share in the GPU space, which would fuel a lot of growth moving forward. Broadcom is another cheap chip stock with a big opportunity in front of it. The company is seeing solid growth, with revenue jumping 25% last quarter to $14.9 billion, led by a 70% surge in its networking revenue. However, it is its foray into custom AI chips that has the potential to really drive growth higher. The company has seen strong success with its first custom AI chip customer,Alphabet, which has led to it winning additional customers. It sees its three furthest-along custom AI chip customers being a $60 billion to $90 billion serviceable market opportunity in its fiscal year 2027 (ending October 2027). If it can capture much of this opportunity, then the stock has a lot of potential upside from here. Notably, that number does not include more recent custom chip customer wins, includingApple. With a PEG of around 0.4 based on fiscal 2026 earnings, Broadcom has some serious upside potential. The biggest risk for it, as well as AMD, would be a slowdown in AI infrastructure spending. Image source: Getty Images. Given their recurring revenue model,software-as-as-service (SaaS)stocks typically trade at premium valuations, but that is not currently the case with Salesforce. With a forward PEG of around 0.5, the stock is in the bargain bin. However, the company has strong data-center and AI opportunities ahead. It's been seeing strong momentum with its Data Cloud solution, which helps customers unify their data into a single source, while it is also looking to be an agentic AI leader with its Agentforce platform. Last quarter, its Data Cloud annual recurring revenue (ARR) soared 120% year over year to more than $1 billion, while its Agentforce platform reached ARR of $100 million after only being launched last fall. The company is looking to tightly integrate Data Cloud and Agentforce with its apps, such as Tableau and Slack, to help spark a new era of digital labor. Meanwhile, it recently introduced a new flexible Agentforce consumption-based pricing model more aligned with outcomes to increase customer satisfaction and drive adoption. While there is always a risk its strategy will not work, at its current valuation, there is not much downside if it doesn't and a lot of upside if it does. It's sometimes hard to believe investors can get the preeminent AI growth stock at a forward PEG of only 0.7 times. However, based on fiscal 2026 projections, that's Nvidia's current valuation. The company has grown its data center revenue ninefold over the past two years, and more growth is ahead. While competitors are trying to make inroads, Nvidia is still the dominant market share leader when it comes to AI chips. It had an incredible 92% market share in the GPU space in Q1. Nvidia's secret sauce remains its CUDA software platform, which it developed to help expand the use of its chips beyond their original purpose of speeding up graphics rendering in video games. It has since layered a collection of libraries and tools on top of CUDA that enhance the performance of its chips in AI tasks. Nvidia's newest chips remain in high demand, and the company is well positioned to continue to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the current AI data center buildout. An AI infrastructure spending slowdown is a risk, but the stock is far from being priced for perfection, giving it solid upside potential from here. Adobe isn't a high-growth stock, but with a PEG of 0.8, it's fallen into the category of growth at a reasonable price (GARP). While AI isn't helping accelerate revenue growth, it has helped it settle in a nice, high-single-digit, low-double-digit range. The company is using AI to help drive results within its creative software solutions, as well as its products aimed more toward business professionals. At the heart of its strategy is its Firefly generative AI model. Using just natural language prompts, FireFly can help users generate images, video, audio, and vector content that they can further manipulate with Adobe's creative tools, such as Photoshop, all while ensuring intellectual property protection. Document Cloud and Express have also incorporated FireFly into their platform and can handle everything from summarizing documents in Document Cloud to text-to-video generation in Express. All in all, the stock is inexpensive, and it looks like AI should continue to help power Adobe's results moving forward.",

The fighting between Israel and Iran remained in focus as President Donald Trump pointed to a two-week time frame for a decision on potential U.S. involvement in the conflict. The S&P 500 slipped 0.2%, closing in negative territory for the third straight session. The Nasdaq was down 0.5%, but the Dow eked out a gain of 0.1%. Accenture (ACN) shares tumbled 6.9%, falling the furthest of any S&P 500 stock, after the professional services firm's bookings for its fiscal third quarterfell shy of analysts' expectations. Although sales and profits for the quarter topped forecasts, boosted by demand related to artificial intelligence (AI) services, Accenture's CEO noted that companies are holding off on hiring consultants in response to the uncertain global economic backdrop. Shares of Albemarle (ALB), the world's largest lithium miner, dropped 4.6% after analysts at UBS reaffirmed their cautious stance on the lithium market. The firm pointed to ongoing oversupply and pricing pressure for the key battery component, suggesting that joint venture structures and strong balance sheets have contributed to making lithium producers slow to make supply adjustments in response to the weak pricing environment. Steel Dynamics (STLD) shares slipped 3.2%, extending losses posted this week after the steelmaker issuedlower-than-expected profit guidancefor the current quarter. Friday's downtick came after Keybanc analysts trimmed their price target on the stock, citing expected softness in galvanized steel spreads. Kroger (KR) shares surged 9.8%, notching the top performance in the S&P 500 on Friday. The operator of the largest chain of traditional grocery stores in the U.S. postedbetter-than-expected profit and identical sales growthfor its fiscal first quarter. While Kroger's chief financial officer discussed ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty, the company boosted its full-year identical sales growth forecast and maintained its other guidance. The food retailer did not provide an update on its search for a new CEO following the resignation of its previous leader in March amid a probe into alleged misconduct. Shares of residential construction materials supplier Builders FirstSource (BLDR) jumped 7.5%. Although Wedbush analysts trimmed their price target on the stock, citing the potential for soft-oriented strand board pricing to weigh on Builders FirstSource's second-quarter results, they maintained their \"outperform\" rating, suggesting that sales trends could be priced in at current levels following the stock's year-to-date decline. Used-car seller CarMax (KMX)topped quarterly profit estimates, and its shares rose 6.6%. Although sales came in slightly below expectations, total revenue was up 6% from the year-ago period, boosted by a 9% year-over-year gain in retail vehicle sales.",

        "content": "US stocks (^DJI,^IXIC,^GSPC) ended Friday's session mixed. Yahoo Finance Markets and Data EditorJared Blikreoutlines some takeaways of the trading day, including equity market weakness, chip stock moves, and the rise of meme stocks. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Asking for a Trendhere. Fizzle Friday is what I'm leading with. And that's because the indices, they just, we've seen volatility contracting. We did have high volume today, and I've been talking about this, and let me just switch over to the indices. We had high volume because it was triple witching options expiration. We had $7 trillion in notional just wiped off the board. And yet, we didn't really do that much. Here's the Dow, here's up eight basis points. Looks like 35 points. And if I show you the four-day chart, you can see it's just been a lot of choppy action from the upper left to the lower right, but we didn't even start up that high. Same thing for the Nasdaq, same thing for the S&P 500. And even if you take a look at the VIX, the VIX was just kind of meandering around that 20 level. That's one of those big psychological magnets. But really not even a lot happening there. There was a lot happening in crude oil, but time limitations, time limitations here. We don't have time to get into crude oil, do we? So, so let me ask you this, Jared. Basically, it feels like summer. I mean, should we, is it time to maybe just already close the books on June at this point? I'll tell you what, there's an interesting, uh, there's an interesting phenomenon that begins next Thursday. The last three trading days of June and the first six trading days of July is called Christmas in July. And it's kind of like the Santa Claus effect. So those nine trading days have a really high historical, uh, I guess potential to run. And I'm going to be covering that in depth next week. So we have something to look forward to, and at least that would put some maybe some green, but that doesn't take away from the fact that we don't really have a lot of volatility, at least at the index level that we're talking about here. All right. So this brings me to my next point, buying the chip dip. And I'm going to go to our heat map, I'm going to show you what chips did today and also over these four days. Today was kind of a downbeat day for chip stocks. This is a four-day look, and I'll show you the intraday just real quickly, so you can see only a couple names in the green, AMD and Micron. But those are two names that I want to chart here because they have been perking up recently. And here's that four-day look again. You get a little bit more green, you can see Nvidia up about 1.3%. Here is AMD, and let's put a year-to-date chart on there. And you can see just poking into the green. So, uh, chips are very cyclical in nature. They're tied to the business cycle. They got hurt a lot in the liberation day selloff. But AMD has climbed back. And also seeing some action in ARM, that was up 7% this week. That's up 17%, and you can see it didn't dip quite as far as AMD into the red. And then Micron was another leader in the S&P 500 this week. And you can see that has now surpassed its highs from earlier in the year, and it's up almost 50%. So that's not nothing. So count one for the chips, at least some of them. I know big picture, the market has been relatively quiet. What are you seeing kind of under the hood though, Jared? Yeah, and I'll tell you what. I am looking at some meme momentum, and meme momentum is mooning. And I just like alliteration, that's why I put that there. But the meme stocks are seeing a little bit of a comeback and some really interesting storylines here. Uh, you know, the meme stocks got their start in early 2021. And we saw a lot of IPOs around that same time. Oscar was one of them. In fact, I think it IPOed in April or March of that year. But nevertheless, let's take a look at the four day on Oscar. That kind of shot up. That's up 52%, no news there to speak of. But you look at the broad board here over the four days, that's a lot of green. Palantir, you know, you can, let me just put this on an equal weight so you get a better view. Uh, you do see a lot of green here. And also, Circle, I just threw that in. Circle, not an OG meme stock because it just IPOed. But let's check out this price action here. And I'm going to put a max chart. Could you push that in the upper right? I can, thank you. One more time. I think three times a charm. Look at the magic touch. Uh, here's the max chart, up 675% from its IPO. Uh, that is just incredible. And by the way, the revenue split on that with Coinbase, 50%. So 50% of their revenue is out the door to Coinbase. And guess who else is looking strong? Coinbase, another meme stock. Uh, that is up 27%. So, uh, you can see, what is this chart? This is a max. Let's go to a four-day. And you can see nice breakout here. And the news this week was all about stable coins. So Circle participating from that, and then Coinbase gets half the revenue. Good for them on that. Put it all together, there's a lot of action and a lot of activity in some of these smaller stocks that's maybe compensating for the lack of action in the majors. So what's on your, uh, what's on your radar this weekend? Dollar, crypto? You know, I think I need to take it easy this weekend. But if I had to look at something, I would be paying attention to probably some of the other altcoins. Bitcoin has kind of slowed down. I want to see some of the altcoins pick up momentum, and then maybe we get that thrust to all-time highs. Right, there it is. Thank you, Jared. Appreciate it.",

        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA,Financials) and Foxconnare in talks to deploy humanoid robotsat a new AI server manufacturing plant in Houston, marking a potential first for both companies in integrating human-like robotics into mass production, Reuters reported Friday, citing two unnamed sources. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. If finalized, the deal would be Nvidia's first use of humanoid robots in manufacturing and Foxconn's first AI server plant to utilize them on a production line. The Houston facility, which is scheduled to begin operations in early 2026, is being designed with extra space to accommodate such automation. Foxconn has tested humanoid robots made in-house and by China's UBTech, though it's unclear which model will be used in Houston or how many will be deployed. Foxconn has trained its robots to perform tasks such as picking and placing objects and inserting cables, according to a company presentation in May. Foxconn executive Leo Guo said last month the company will unveil two humanoid robot models at its November tech eventone with legs and another with a wheeled autonomous mobile base. Nvidia, which supplies the computing platforms for many humanoid robotics developers, announced in April it would manufacture AI supercomputers in Texas through partnerships with Foxconn in Houston and Wistron in Dallas. Both plants are expected to scale production within 12 to 15 months. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in March that humanoid robots would become commonplace in factories within five years. Automakers such as Mercedes-Benz, BMW, and Tesla (TSLA,Financials) are also investing in the space, while China has identified humanoid robotics as a strategic sector. Both Nvidia and Foxconn declined to comment. This article first appeared onGuruFocus.",

        "content": "Just months after suggesting that the widespread adoption ofquantum computingwas still \u201c15 to 20 years away,\u201d Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang offered a much more optimistic outlook, sparking a rally in speculative quantum stocks, such as Quantum Computing, Inc. (QUBT). The tech pioneer is up 8.5% so far this week, with bullish sentiment at its peak. Easily unpack a company's performancewith TipRanks' new KPI Datafor smart investment decisions Receive undervalued, market resilient stocks right to your inboxwith TipRanks' Smart Value Newsletter However, a deeper look reveals significant concerns about QUBT\u2019s financial position. And while the industry is making progress, scaling quantum systems to tackle real-world problems remains a massive challenge, particularly for a company of QUBT\u2019s size. Despite the broader enthusiasm for \u201clifting all boats\u201d in the sector, I remain bearish on QUBT. Being the CEO of a major tech company comes with significant influence\u2014something Nvidia\u2019s Jensen Huang demonstrated at the GTC Paris developer conference when he declared that \u201cquantum computing is reaching an inflection point.\u201d While his remarks centered on Nvidia\u2019s own innovations\u2014like CUDA-Q, which aims to integrate quantum capabilities with classical systems\u2014his optimism could have ripple effects across the sector. Nvidia backed its words with action in March 2025 by launching a new quantum computing research lab in Boston, reinforcing its leadership in the space. Huang\u2019s bullish tone may inspire increased venture capital and R&D investment across the quantum ecosystem. However, skepticism persists. Many still view practical quantum applications as decades away, with the industry struggling to define clear, real-world use cases that outperform traditional supercomputers. Without a breakthrough and tangible return on investment (ROI), quantum computing remains a tough sell to potential customers seeking immediate, measurable benefits. Quantum Computing Inc. specializes in photonic, or light-based, quantum solutions, developing Quantum Processing Units (QPUs) designed to operate at room temperature and low power, features that could make the technology more accessible and cost-effective. However, the company\u2019s focus remains on niche applications, such as remote sensing and computational chemistry, which limits its current market reach. While progress is being made in identifying use cases where quantum systems may outperform classical supercomputers, practical, scalable, and commercially viable applications are still emerging. The technology faces persistent challenges, including qubit fragility, high error rates, and scalability limitations. These machines are highly specialized and complex, suited for addressing targeted, advanced problems, but are not yet ready for broad commercial deployment. Quantum Computing\u2019s first-quarter 2025 earningshighlight just how early-stage its business remains. The company reported revenue of only $39,000\u2014roughly equivalent to the median U.S. individual income\u2014while operating expenses climbed to $8.3 million. A $23.6 million non-cash gain from the mark-to-market revaluation of its warrant liability resulted in a reported net income of $17 million. However, this masks the company\u2019s ongoing operational losses. On the operational front, the company completed construction of its Quantum Photonic Chip Foundry. It announced new partnerships, including a contract with NASA\u2019s Langley Research Center\u2014a sign of growing institutional interest despite modest commercial traction so far. Quantum Computing\u2019s ~$3 billion market cap, despite minimal revenue, highlights an apparent disconnect from fundamentals and suggests the stock is driven largely by speculation. While the company holds $166 million in cash and cash equivalents, providing it with some runway to develop its technology, its R&D budget is modest compared to that of deep-pocketed rivals like IBM, Google, Microsoft, and Nvidia. Importantly, this cash position was built primarily through dilutive stock offerings and private placements, underscoring its heavy reliance on external funding. Given these constraints, it\u2019s difficult to envision a near-term path where Quantum Computing scales its niche technology into a broadly commercial product in a way that meaningfully rewards shareholders. Reflecting its speculative nature, Quantum Computing\u2019s analyst coverage is limited. ItsModerate Buyconsensus rating is based on one Buy recommendation in the past three months. Itsaverage price target of $14.00implies a downside potential of ~27% over the next 12 months. Meanwhile, TipRanksAIassigns QUBT aNeutralrating and a price target of $22. It notes that Quantum Computing\u2019s strong balance sheet and Qatalyst software positions it favorably amid hardware advances and increasing demand. However, it also points out that QUBT sports a high valuation, especially in light of ongoing losses and minimal revenues. While quantum computing as a whole may be approaching an \u201cinflection point,\u201d the outlook for pure-play firms like Quantum Computing Inc. remains highly speculative. With minimal revenue, the company is still far from its own inflection point, where its products gain broad commercial viability. Reaching that stage will likely require scientific breakthroughs and significant R&D investment, which Quantum Computing may struggle to match relative to well-funded giants like IBM. That said, growing industry momentum is a clear tailwind. Rising interest in the sector could lead to increased funding, larger contracts, and a stronger push toward practical applications. Quantum Computing\u2019s unique focus on room-temperature, low-power photonic quantum systems, along with its early, albeit modest, commercial traction, may appeal to risk-tolerant, long-term investors. Personally, I remain highly cautious. The company\u2019s weak financial performance, lofty valuation, and limited ability to compete with larger players make its long-term investment case difficult to justify at this stage.
