        "content": "Investors, including billionaires, have generated enormous returns by investing inNvidia(NVDA1.69%)in recent years. The artificial intelligence (AI) chip giant climbed more than 800% from the start of 2023 through the end of last year as demand for its products and services soared. And with the AI market forecast to reach beyond $2 trillion a few years down the road, it's likely Nvidia will continue to benefit. But it's important to remember that Nvidia isn't the only attractive AI bet to be found. In fact, right now, some of the world's top investors are favoring another AI giant over Nvidia. This particular player is among the top five holdings of billionaires David Tepper of Appaloosa Management, Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management, and Stephen Mandel Jr. of Lone Pine Capital. This company, like Nvidia, already has brought in billions of dollars in revenue thanks to AI -- and could win as the AI boom continues. Let's find out more. Image source: Getty Images. First, it's important to note that these three billionaires have significant positions in technology stocks, with other such players among their top 10 holdings. So they clearly believe in the AI revolution and are setting themselves up to potentially gain as AI becomes more and more a part of our daily lives and the operations at businesses of every size. For example, Tepper and Mandel each have threeMagnificent Seven stocksamong their 10 most heavily weighted holdings, and Laffont has four. So, which company has caught the eye of these technology-focused investors? None other than AI powerhouseAmazon(AMZN0.80%). As of the first quarter of the year, Amazon is the third biggest stock position in Tepper's $8.3 billion portfolio, the second-biggest in Laffont's $22 billion portfolio, and the third- largest in Mandel's $11 billion fund. Here are the details: This is according tothe billionaires' 13Fs, filings that managers of $100 million or more must submit to the Securities and Exchange Commission on a quarterly basis. Now the question is: These billionaires clearly see Amazon as afantastic AI investment, but is it right for you too? After all, though billionaires have demonstrated their investment expertise, some of their moves may not suit your investment strategy or comfort with risk. It's important to take these elements into consideration before diving in. You probably are most familiar with Amazon thanks to its e-commerce business. It's built an empire in the area, and one that extends around the globe. The operation helps the company generate billions of dollars in revenue year after year, and its extensive fulfillment network and popular subscription program Prime offer it a significant competitive advantage, or moat. But Amazon also is becoming a leader in AI, using the technology to streamline those e-commerce operations and even developing and selling AI products and services to customers through its Amazon Web Services (AWS) unit. In fact, due to Amazon's aggressive push into the AI space, AWS recently delivered a $117 billion annual revenue run rate. So Amazon already is generating significant growth from this hot technology. And since AWS is the world's leading cloud services provider, it's in the perfect spot to capture more and more business. As AWS customers develop AI projects, they have all that they need right at their fingertips on AWS -- from access to top chips like Nvidia's to a fully managed service that tailors popular large language models to a customer's needs. The AI buildout continues, and AWS is set to gain from this and from the next stages of AI, as customers apply AI to their businesses more and more. Meanwhile, Amazon offers a solid track record of earnings growth and has demonstrated its ability to manage turbulent times and go on to grow. For example, the company revamped its cost structure when higher inflation hurt earnings a few years ago and returned to growth within a year. All of this shows that Amazon is well positioned to benefit from the AI boom, but the stock also offers you security thanks to its well-established and profitable e-commerce and cloud businesses. And this means that, whether you're a cautious or aggressive investor, you may, like the billionaires, want to make Amazon one of your key AI bets.",

The tariff hike, which the president announced late Friday, sent shares in Ford and General Motors (GM) tumbling on Mondayover concerns the levies would greatly increase automakers' manufacturing costs.

        "content": "Year to date,Nvidia(NVDA0.73%)stock has returned 2%, whilePalantir Technologies(PLTR-0.50%)stock has advanced 72%. But forecasts from Wall Street analysts suggest that investors should buy one and sell the other. However, Wall Street has consistently underestimated Palantir, so investors shouldn't simply follow analysts' opinions. Here's a closer look at both companies. Image source: Getty Images. Nvidia reported encouraging financial results in the first quarter of fiscal 2026, which ended in April. Revenue increased 69% to $44 billion, andnon-GAAPnet income increased 33% to $0.81 per diluted share. Importantly, adjusted earnings would have increased 57% had it not been for a write-down related to semiconductor export restrictions. The investment thesis for Nvidia is simple: The company holds more than 80% market share in data centergraphics processing units(GPUs), chips used to accelerate complex workloads likeartificial intelligence(AI).Morgan Stanleyanalysts think the company can maintain 80%+ market share for the foreseeable future. Importantly, Nvidia also has a booming networking business. In fact, the chipmaker is the market leader in InfiniBand platforms, which are presently the preferred connectivity technology for back-end AI networks. And it recently addedAlphabet's Google andMeta Platformsas customers. Put simply, Nvidia is the company best positioned to capitalize on demand for AI hardware. However, Nvidia is battling headwinds related to semiconductor export restrictions. The Trump administration recentlyrevoked the AI Diffusion Rule, but it alsobanned the unlicensed sale of H20 GPUs to China, which effectively stops the company from participating in that market. Nvidia wrote down $4.5 billion in H20 inventory during the first quarter, and management says it will lose $8 billion in revenue in the second quarter. Nevertheless, Wall Street estimates that Nvidia's adjusted earnings will increase 44% in fiscal 2027, according to LSEG. That estimate makes the current valuation of 43 times earnings look cheap. I wholeheartedly agree with Wall Street's rating on Nvidia. Patient investors should feel comfortable buying a position at the current price. Palantir reported strong Q1 financial results. Customers climbed 39% to 769 and the average existing customer spent 124% more. Revenue soared 39% to $884 million, the seventh straight acceleration, and non-GAAP earnings increased 62% to $0.13 per diluted share. The investment thesis for Palantir centers on its unique software architecture, which not only lets customers pull nuanced insights from complex data, but also creates a feedback loop that yields insights that improve over time. The International Data Corp. (IDC) has recognized Palantir as the market leader in decision intelligence software. Palantir also says its software architecture is unique in its ability to operationalize artificial intelligence, meaning its platforms can help clients move AI applications from prototype to production more effectively than other solutions on the market.Forrester Researchrecently ranked Palantir as a technology leader in AI platforms, awarding it higher scores than peers like Google andMicrosoft. However, not even the best business is worth buying at any price, and Palantir commands a very rich valuation. The stock currently trades at 285 times adjusted earnings. This looks particularly expensive because Wall Street estimates that the company's earnings will increase just 26% in the current year. Here's the bottom line: Palantir is an excellent company and I believe it will be worth more in the future, but I also think the risk-reward profile is heavily skewed toward risk at the current price. So, prospective investors should wait for a better buying opportunity, but current shareholders comfortable with volatility can sit tight.",

        "content": "Data is Wall Street's currency, and there's an abundance of it to go around. Between earnings season -- the six-week stretch each quarter where mostS&P 500companies report their operating results -- and economic data releases, there's an almost overwhelming amount of information for investors to absorb. Occasionally, something important can fall through the cracks. For example, May 15 marked the deadline for institutional investors overseeing at least $100 million in assets under management to fileForm 13Fwith the Securities and Exchange Commission -- and you might have missed it. This filing, which is due no later than 45 calendar days following the end to a quarter, details which stocks, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and (select) stock options Wall Street's brightest money managers purchased and sold in the latest quarter. It can offer big-time clues as to which influential stocks are garnering interest or falling out of favor. WhileBerkshire Hathaway'sWarren Buffett is the stock market's most-followed money manager, he's far from the only billionaire investor known to move markets. Image source: Getty Images. For instance, Duquesne Family Office's Stanley Druckenmiller and Lone Pine Capital's Stephen Mandel have exemplary investment track records of their own, along with billions of dollars in assets under management. What's particularly noteworthy about the first-quarter 13Fs from Druckenmiller's and Mandel's respective funds has been their approach to theartificial intelligence (AI)revolution.Both billionaires have dumped the preeminent AI stock on Wall Streetin favor of a company that's critical to enterprise AI data centers. With the analysts at PwC pegging the addressable market for artificial intelligence at $15.7 trillion by 2030, there's room for hundreds of businesses to get their piece of the pie. However, no company has been a more direct beneficiary of the evolution of AI thanNvidia(NVDA0.73%). It's also the stock billionaires Stanley Druckenmiller and Stephen Mandel sent packing. Accounting forNvidia's 10-for-1 forward split in June 2024, Duquesne Family Office held 9,500,750 shares in the June-ended quarter of 2023. Meanwhile, Lone Pine Capital possessed 6,416,490 shares of Nvidia, also at the end of June 2023. But over the following 15 months for Druckenmiller and 12 months for Mandel, both billionaires would oversee the complete purge of their respective fund's Nvidia holdings. While there's no denying that Nvidia's Hopper (H100) graphics processing unit (GPU) and Blackwell GPU architecture arethe preferred options in AI-accelerated data centers, and it's pretty clear that no other external competitors are particularly close to challenging Nvidia's hardware in terms of compute abilities, there are still viable reasons for Druckenmiller and Mandel to have cashed in their chips. One obvious reason to sell is simple profit-taking. Nvidia stock skyrocketed from early 2023 into late 2024, which increased its valuation by more than $3 trillion. We've never witnessed a megacap business add $3 trillion in market cap so quickly before, which may have encouraged these two billionaires to lock in their gains. But there might be more than just profit-taking behind this selling activity. For instance, it'sonly logical to expect competitive pressures to mount in the hardware arena. Even though Hopper and Blackwell hold most of the AI-GPU market share in high-compute data centers, external competitors are ramping up production of existing chips and bringing more energy-efficient hardware to market. What's more, many of Nvidia's top customers by net sales are developing AI-GPUs and AI solutions of their own. Even though these chips aren't going to be as fast as the Hopper or Blackwell, they're expected to be considerably cheaper and they won't be backlogged like Nvidia's hardware.This is a direct threat to the AI-GPU scarcitythat's afforded Nvidia superior pricing power for its GPUs. History isn't exactly in Nvidia's corner, either. Despite AI supporting a lofty addressable market, every next-big-thing technology and innovation for more than three decades has endured an early stage bubble-bursting event. In short, investors have a historically strong tendency to overestimate how quickly a new innovation will gain utility and be adopted on a mainstream basis. With artificial intelligence likely needing time to mature as a technology, it's the most-direct beneficiary, Nvidia, which could feel the pain if a bubble forms and bursts. Image source: Getty Images. While Duquesne's and Lone Pine's billionaire chiefs pared down the number of stocks they're holding amid a volatile first quarter,there's one artificial intelligence stock both have been buying-- and it plays a vital role in the expansion of AI-accelerated data centers. The new AI apple of Druckenmiller's and Mandel's eye is none other than leading chip fabrication companyTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(TSM-0.18%), which is more commonly known as \"TSMC.\" Duquesne more than quintupled its existing stake by adding 491,265 shares of TSMC during the March-ended quarter, while Lone Pine's 13F shows that 104,937 shares of TSMC were purchased in the first quarter of 2025. Most AI-GPU companies rely on Taiwan Semi's fabrication services, including industry leader Nvidia and key rivalAdvanced Micro Devices. TSMC is in the process of rapidly expanding its monthly chip-on-wafer-on-substrate (CoWoS) capacity fromapproximately 35,000 units in 2024 to an estimated 135,000 units monthly by 2026. CoWoS is a technology used to package high-bandwidth memory, which is necessary for high-compute data centers where software and systems are making split-second decisions. With demand for AI-GPUs overwhelming their supply over the last two years, TSMC has enjoyed a significant backlog for its chip fabrication services and has seen more its net sales skew toward high-performance computing, which can yield higher margins for the company. On a year-over-year basis, TSMC's net sales from high-performance computing surged from 46% to 59%, as of the March-ended quarter. Although the possible bursting of an AI bubble would be a concern for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, the company's order backlog and revenue diversification offers some semblance of protection. For instance, 28% of net sales in the first quarter derived from advanced chips used in smartphones.Appleprominently leans on TSMC for the chips used in the iPhone. The great thing about smartphones and wireless service access is they've both evolved into basic necessities for most Americans. Even though demand for smartphone chips isn't growing as quickly as it once did, the cash flow from this segment tends to be highly predictable for TSMC. Taiwan Semi has a long runway of opportunity in Internet of Things and automotive, as well. As homes and vehicles become more technology-dependent, companies like TSMC will be relied on to manufacture these advanced chips. Lastly, Druckenmiller and Mandel may have been encouraged by the dip in Taiwan Semiconductor's stock in the first quarter. Though TSMC stock isn't (currently) historically inexpensive, its shares did drop to aforward price-to-earnings ratioof nearly 15 during tail-end of the March quarter. This makes for an attractive multiple, when compared to Nvidia.",

        "content": "The S&P 500 (^GSPC)just logged its best May in more than 30 yearsin large part due to the return of dominance from the\"Magnificent Seven\"tech stocks. Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL,GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA) combined for 62% of the S&P 500's advance in May. Nvidia and Tesla led the gains, rising more than 20% in the month. Overall, six of the seven stocks outperformed the S&P 500's 6.2% gain for May, with Apple ending the month as the lone laggard. DataTrek Research co-founder Nicholas Colas wrote in a note to clients that Big Tech's recent outperformance shows \"this important slice of the US equity market has genuine momentum.\" \"The fact that capital is rotating back into US large cap Tech/Big Tech is further proof that the market has finally found its footing,\" he added. There are several factors that have been driving these stocks higher. But perhaps chief among them is that Big Tech continues to churn out stronger earnings growth than the rest of the S&P 500. In the recently reported first quarter, the Magnificent Seven group of stocks grew earnings by a combined 27.7% compared to the same quarter a year ago, well above the 9.4% growth seen from the other 493 members of the index, per FactSet senior earnings analyst John Butters. The Big Tech companies surprised analysts more too. In aggregate, Magnificent Seven earnings growth beat Wall Street's estimates by 11.7%, compared to the 4.6% beat for the other 493 companies. Citi US equity strategist Drew Pettit told Yahoo Finance that this helps explain why the Magnificent Seven have been outperforming other stocks amid the run higher in the market over the past month. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) has risen about 11% over the past month, roughly doubling the S&P 500's percentage return in that same time period. \"With the tariff concern and some of the macro hesitancy, like investment hesitancy and buying hesitancy, you're back to growth,\" Pettit said. \"When valuations aren't cheap versus history for anything, might as well go to the place that's got some [earnings] upside.\" Read more:How to protect your money during economic turmoil, stock market volatility Charles Schwab senior investment strategist Kevin Gordon pointed out that Big Tech also led the market lower during the sell-off that began in late February and carried through April. \"Tech and the Magnificent Seven, in general, got hit the hardest,\" Gordon said. \"So it's not surprising to see them bounce the hardest as well.\" Another reason for the Magnificent Seven's surge is that investors have favored large-cap stocks in the most recent market rally. When investors are concerned about a rise in bond yields,as has been the case over the past several weekswith the 30-year Treasury yield (^TYX) briefly pressing near levels not seen since the great financial crisis, large-cap stocks have outperformed. This has Pettit and the strategy team continuing to describe a preference toward a \"growth is defensive trade.\" He said as long as rates stay elevated and the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) hasn't fallen closer to 4%, \"there's only one game in town,\" and it's growth.

        "content": "TheDow Jones Industrial Average(^DJI-0.06%)index, which includes the 30 most prominent companies in the U.S., is used by some as a benchmark of the American economy. Over the past 10 years, the Dow advanced about 135%, even as the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation, rising interest rates, and other macro headwinds rattled the markets. Also, over that decade, some well-known companies, includingGeneral Electric,ExxonMobil,Pfizer, andIntel, were removed from the index and replaced by higher-growth companies, includingAmazon,Salesforce, andNvidia. But despite those occasional changes, the Dow remains a good starting point for seeking out some promising long-term investments. Today, I'll look at two of those stocks --Apple(AAPL-0.31%)andCisco Systems(CSCO0.12%)-- and explain why they're set to soar in 2025 and beyond. Image source: Getty Images. Apple's stock has slumped about 20% since the beginning of the year. The bulls shunned the tech titan for four main reasons. First, the Trump administration's unpredictable tariffs, especially against China, could cause its production costs to soar. Second, Apple'sAI effortsfailed to impress investors as much as OpenAI's ChatGPT and other generative AI platforms. Third, its closely watched mixed reality efforts fizzled out after it halted its production of the Vision Pro. Lastly, Fortnite publisher Epic Games won a major legal victory against Apple after a U.S. court ruled that the company could bypass its App Store fees with other payment methods. That victory could allow other developers to bypass Apple's 30% fees with a similar payment measure. All of those challenges -- along with Warren Buffett's decision to trimBerkshire Hathaway's big stake in Apple over the past year -- weighed down its stock. Yet investors are overlooking some of Apple's long-term strengths. It ended its latest quarter with $133 billion in cash and marketable securities, which gives it ample room for fresh investments and acquisitions. It has an installed device base of over 2.2 billion, and it's already locked in over a billion paid subscriptions across all of its services. It could leverage that massive audience to justify its App Store fees as it appeals the Epic Games ruling. Apple's brand appeal, the stickiness of its ecosystem, and its high switching costs should continue to drive its future sales of iPhones, Macs, iPads, and other devices. Its rollout of new custom chips, its integration of new AI features, and a more affordable version of the Vision Pro -- which might arrive in 2026 or 2027 -- could keep it ahead of its Android-based rivals. As for the tariffs, it could mitigate those impacts by shifting its supply chains to lower-tariff countries like India or Vietnam. From fiscal 2024, which ended last September, to fiscal 2027, analysts expect Apple's earnings per share (EPS) to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12%. Its stock still looks reasonably valued at 26 times next year's earnings, and it should head higher once it resolves its near-term issues. Cisco's stock has risen about 6% this year. Investors warmed up to the world's top networking hardware and software company as its growth stabilized and fresh catalysts appeared on the horizon. It struggled in fiscal 2024, which ended last July, as its customers placed too many hardware orders after its previous supply constraints eased in fiscal 2023. A challenging macro environment then drove those customers to deploy those devices at a slower-than-expected rate -- so Cisco's shipments abruptly dried up. But over the past year, Cisco's hardware sales stabilized as the market's demand finally caught up with its inventories again. It also expanded its observability segment by acquiring Splunk last March, and it's been expanding its cybersecurity business with new AI-powered services such as Hypershield and AI Defense. Moreover, its AI-related infrastructure business continued to expand and generated $1.35 billion in revenue in the first nine months of fiscal 2025. That accounted for 3% of its revenue during those three quarters and easily surpassed its prior goal for generating $1 billion in AI infrastructure revenue for the full fiscal year. Cisco will probably never become a hypergrowth AI play like Nvidia, yet it provides the essential building blocks for the growing data center, cloud, and AI markets. With $15.6 billion in cash and marketable securities at the end of its latest quarter, it still has plenty of room to expand its higher-growth businesses and maintain its buybacks, which cancelled out over a fifth of its shares over the past decade, for years to come. From fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2027, analysts expect Cisco's EPS to grow at a CAGR of 9% -- and its stock still isn't expensive at 22 times next year's earnings. Simply put, it could head a lot higher over the next few years as its core markets expand.",

        "content": "Nvidia(NVDA1.17%)is breathing downMicrosoft's neck to become the world's most valuable company. I think it's only a matter of time before theGPUmaker takes the No. 1 spot. In Nvidia's latest quarterly update, CEO Jensen Huang spoke about four artificial intelligence (AI) growth drivers that \"are really kicking into turbocharge.\" Huang was onto something, in my opinion. I even predict that the four explosive AI megatrends he mentioned will catapult Nvidia to a $5 trillionmarket cap. Huang discussed reasoning AI extensively during Nvidia's first-quarter earnings call. Reasoning AI solves problems step by step. It's also a critical technology for taking AI agents to the next level. Huang noted that there has been \"a huge breakthrough in the last couple of years\" that has resulted in \"super agents\" that use multiple tools and work in clusters to solve problems. These reasoning AI agents will almost certainly become heavily used by lots of companies over the next few years. However, they require exponentially more computing power than past AI models. That's great news for Nvidia. Huang believes that his company's Grace Blackwell and NVL72 (which connects Grace CPUs to Blackwell GPUs) together make \"the ideal engine\" for reasoning AI. I think he's right. And I predict the skyrocketing demand for this technology -- and the future newer-generation versions on the way -- will provide a huge tailwind that helps get Nvidia to a $5 trillion market cap. Huang praised the Trump administration for rescinding the AI diffusion rule established during the Biden administration. This rule, which was originally scheduled to go into effect on May 15, 2025, before its rescission, would have restricted U.S. AI chip exports to many countries. AI won't be limited to a handful of technologically advanced nations. Jensen correctly observed in the Q1 earnings call that \"countries around the world are awakening to the importance of AI as an infrastructure, not just as a technology of great curiosity and great importance, but infrastructure for their industries and start-ups and society.\" As countries build AI infrastructure, Huang thinks it will create a tremendous opportunity for Nvidia. Again, I fully agree. Image source: Nvidia. Enterprise AI is the integration of AI throughout a large organization to improve its business processes. Huang said in Nvidia's Q1 call, \"Enterprise AI is just taking off.\" This megatrend is joined at the hip with reasoning AI. Many of the AI agents that reasoning AI makes possible will be deployed enterprise-wide. Huang pointed out that enterprise information technology consists of three major components: compute, storage, and networking. These components are also critical for enterprise AI. Nvidia has put all of them together. I expect the company will see strong revenue and earnings growth as a result of its enterprise AI leadership, which will propel its market cap higher. Industrial AI was the last AI megatrend mentioned by Huang. It's the application of AI to industrial processes to improve efficiency and productivity. Huang predicted, \"[E]very factory today that makes things will have an AI factory that sits with it.\" He believes these AI factories will create and operate AI for the physical factory, plus \"power the products and the things that are made by the factory.\" His vision also includes robots in the factories. Nvidia's Omniverse product already helps manufacturers build 3D simulations and \"digital twins\" of real-world facilities. They can also use Omniverse to train and test autonomous vehicles and robots used in factories. Is Huang right that \"every factory will have an AI factory\"? Maybe not. However, I suspect that many factories will. And I predict industrial AI will be a significant growth driver for Nvidia over the next decade that helps catapult the company to a $5 trillion market cap.",

        "header": "3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy If You're Bullish on a 2025 Rebound",
        "content": "The three major benchmarks struggled in the first months of the year as investors worried about the economic situation ahead. President Donald Trump set out a plan to impose tariffs on imports, a move analysts and economists said could weigh on growth. The concern is both businesses and consumers would face higher costs -- a scenario that might hurt corporate earnings. Over the past few weeks, though, certain positive elements have helped theS&P 500(^GSPC-0.04%), theDow Jones Industrial Average(^DJI0.09%), and theNasdaq Composite(^IXIC-0.06%)to rebound. The U.S. reached initial trade deals with the U.K. and China, and the U.S. temporarily exempted the high-growth area of electronics from import tariffs. Of course, uncertainty still remains. A federal court ruling recently halted Trump's tariffs, but an appeals court then ruled the U.S. could continue collecting duties. And this legal battle may continue. Meanwhile, tensions between the U.S. and China just intensified again as the U.S. said China breached their trade agreement. But these latest events could be temporary disturbances and might not hold indexes back for very long. And artificial intelligence (AI) stocks could be the first to benefit, considering the growth potential of that market -- analysts expect it to surpass $2 trillion by the early 2030s. So, if you're bullish on a 2025 rebound, consider these three AI stocks to buy. Image source: Getty Images. Nvidiadominates the AI chip market, but that doesn't mean there isn't room for other winners. And one that's showing potential isAdvanced Micro Devices(AMD-0.83%). This chip designer is on the way up, offering an AI chip -- MI300X -- that may not beat Nvidia's top chip, but still offers customers quality performance. Customers are realizing this, helping AMD's data center revenue to soar 57% in the recent quarter. Year-over-year growth accelerated for the fourth straight quarter, even against the backdrop of a complex economic environment, CEO Lisa Su said. This was done at increasing profitability on sales, withnon-GAAP(generally accepted accounting principles) gross margin expanding to 54% from 52% in the year-earlier period. AMD also is a leader in the central processing unit (CPU) market -- these are the main processors found in standard computers -- and recently gained more than 16% in CPU market share, bringing it close to beatingIntelin that market, according to Wccftech. AMD trades for 27xforward earnings estimates, down from 54x less than a year ago, yet revenue has climbed significantly -- so now looks like a great time to buy.  AMD PE Ratio (Forward)data byYCharts Broadcom(AVGO0.70%)is a networking expert, selling a wide range of products used anywhere from your smartphone to data centers. And speaking of data centers, they're driving growth for the company now as demand from AI customers soars. In the most recent quarter, the company's AI revenue surged 77% to $4.1 billion, and consolidated revenue and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) reached record levels. Importantly, the momentum looks set to continue. Broadcom forecast $4.4 billion in AI semiconductor revenue for the second quarter, saying this will be driven by big cloud service providers as they pile into connectivity solutions. Broadcom also predicted its three major cloud customers will result in a serviceable addressable market of $60 billion to $90 billion in fiscal 2027. And this doesn't even include four other big customers working with Broadcom to develop AI accelerators. Broadcom stock is trading close to its all-time high,\u00a0but considering the AI growth ahead andits valuationof 36x forward earnings estimates, there still is room for the stock to run -- and it may gather momentum as the indexes rebound. Oracle(ORCL0.08%)once was mainly known for its database management platform, but in recent times, it's become a significant player in the AI story. This tech giant offers a broad and flexible range of cloud solutions and has seen AI cloud infrastructure revenue take off in recent quarters -- in the most recent period, it soared nearly 50%. The company's record level of sales contracts in the quarter offer us visibility on what's ahead, and there's reason to be optimistic: This $48 billion in contracts helped remaining performance obligations, or revenue to expect from these deals, to climb 63% to $130 billion. On top of this, Oracle is involved in the Stargate project to build out AI infrastructure in the U.S., and the company also is playing a key role in an international Stargate effort. Along with partners including AI chip giant Nvidia, Oracle will help build a Stargate campus in the United Arab Emirates. As for valuation, Oracle looks reasonably priced, trading at 27x forward earnings estimates, considering these catalysts for growth that could push the stock higher in the months and quarters to come. So, if indexes rebound in 2025, Oracle may be one of the big winners.",

        "header": "Stock-Split Watch: Is Palantir Next?",
        "content": "Palantir Technologies(PLTR0.94%)has been unstoppable over the last few months, adding 509% to its share price since 2024 for a total return of 1,332% since it hit the market in late 2020. When a public company starts growing this fast, it's normal to wonder if astock splitmight soon be on the table. Let's dig deeper to answer this question. Companies often turn to stock splits after experiencing a tremendous amount of growth. This technique involves dividing each share by a specific amount to increase the number outstanding while keeping the samemarket cap(the value of all shares combined). The goal is to make the stock appear cheaper and more accessible for investors. Stock splits are typically seen as a positive sign because they suggest that a company is in good shape while making its equity easier to trade. And according toBank of Americaanalyst Jared Woodard, split stocks have consistently outperformed the market averages recently. That said, it looks unlikely that Palantir will split its stock anytime soon. While the company has grown significantly over the last five years, it still trades for a relatively bite-size $132 per share. This number is considerably lower than recent high-profile splitters likeNvidiaandTesla, which split their stocks at $1,209 and $891, respectively. Palantir investors should expect much more growth before a possible split. If the company manages to repeat the 1,334% five-year return it experienced since its initial public offering, each share would be worth approximately $1,758 by 2030, which would make a stock split much more likely. However, this price tag would give Palantir a market cap of $4.15 trillion, making it the most valuable company in the world, while other factors held constant. There are several reasons investors shouldn't expect this to happen. For starters, it already has an astronomical valuation. With aprice-to-earnings(P/E) multiple of 573, it is one of the most overvalued stocks on the market. For context, theS&P 500has an average P/E of just 28, while AI leader Nvidia trades at just 44 times trailing earnings despite growing its business by 69% year over year in its most recent quarter. Image source: Getty Images. Palantir's growth is good but hardly enough to justify its current valuation -- let alone any expectations of future multibagger potential. First-quarter revenue jumped 39% year over year to $883.9 million, driven by strong demand among public- and private-sector clients for its data analytics and AI solutions. Profits more than doubled to $217.7 million. And the company continues to win high-profile contracts like with the U.S. Army and NATO, which both plan to implement its AI-powered Maven Smart System, designed to provide battlefield awareness and planning. But while these results would be fantastic in a vacuum, a great company isn't always a good investment if excessive expectations are built into its price tag. Palantir's P/E of 573 looks almost impossible to justify, even if the business continues to hum along at current levels. The short answer to that question is no. Companies have tended to split at around quadruple-digit stock prices. And with a current share price of $132, the stock is already alarmingly expensive compared to the size of its business and current growth rate. Instead of waiting for more multibagger gains, investors should probably be thinking about when it's time to take profits off the table.",

        "content": "Chicago, IL \u2013 June 3, 2025 \u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Nvidia NVDA, CoreWeave CRWV, Amazon AMZN, iShares Bitcoin ETF IBIT and D-Wave Quantum QBTS. Despite the recent flurry of tariff news and economic uncertainty portrayed by pundits, several key indicators are flashing bullish signals, including: The \u201cGDPNow Model\u201d is a model created by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta to provide a real-time estimate of the current quarter\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth. Through its \u201cNowcasting\u201d model, the GDPNow Model leverages a purely data-driven model that interprets current data to predict the future instead of simply predicting future economic conditions. Between the first negative GDP reading in several quarters, an escalating trade war, and negative sentiment, the GDP picture looked quite bleak. However, the current market environment illustrates why savvy investors rely on data-driven predictive models to eliminate bias and find the hard truth. In the latest reading, the GDPNow Model for real GDP growth (seasonally adjusted annual rate) in Q2 2025 is a robust 3.8%, up from 2.2% in the last reading. The PCE Price Index (Personal Consumption Expenditures) number was released Friday. The reading came in at a 2.1% gain year-over-yea,r which was softer than Wall Street expected. The key inflation rate hit a 4-year low. Meanwhile, \u201cSupercore PCE,\u201d which measures the price of \u201ccore services,\u201d saw its first negative reading since COVID. The latest inflation reading shows that President Trump\u2019s tariff policy has not negatively impacted prices (at least yet.) With PCE near the Fed\u2019s 2% target, investors should expect rate cuts in 2025 \u2013 a bullish development for stocks. Bull markets are driven by high-growth industries, and currently, the industry with the most innovation and the highest growth potential is the artificial intelligence (AI) space. Within the AI industry,Nvidia, the semiconductor leader, is the most important stock. In fact, without Nvidia\u2019s GPUs, it\u2019s impossible to be an AI leader. The company\u2019s earnings report in late May showed that there is plenty of room for the industry left to grow. Revenue bolted 69% year-over-year to $44 billion despite a $4.45 billion charge attributed to H20 product export restrictions to China. Despite the uncertainty in the macro trade environment, Zacks Consensus Analyst Estimates suggest that top and bottom-line growth will continue to grow at a healthy clip in the mid-double-digits. Meanwhile, other AI industry leaders echo Nvidia\u2019s significant growth. For instance, fellow AI leader and recent IPOCoreWeavereported Q1 revenue of $982 million, a fourfold year-over-year increase. Meanwhile, theAmazonAWS Chief reported Friday that AI cloud sales have reached multiple billions. Bitcoin and bitcoin proxies likeiShares Bitcoin ETFhave been valuable tools for investors to leverage as a leading indicator. For instance, IBIT topped on December 17th, 2024, well before the S&P 500 Index topped in February 2025. Now, IBIT is breaking out to new highs well before the major US equity indices. Could they follow next? Meanwhile, other risk-on areas of the market are showing that the \u201canimal spirits\u201d are alive and well. For example, quantum computing leaderD-Wave Quantumis up nearly 70% year-to-date. The general market exhibits a massive change of character over just the past month or two. For instance, Friday, President Trump said on social media that \u201cChina\u2019s has totally violated its agreement with the US.\u201d Earlier in the year, stocks would have plunged on this news. However, this time, the market opened lower by around 1%, only to quickly find buyers and finish the session green. Brushing off bad news is a hallmark of a bull market and is a subtle clue for savvy investors that the market is resilient. Now, the S&P 500 is setting up a picture-perfect daily bull flag pattern. The confluence of strong economic indicators, the AI revolution, and the market\u2019s resilient behavior point to a market where bulls are in control. Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.7% average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of+48.4%, +50.2%and+56.7%per year.

CC Wei, CEO of TSMC (2330.TW,TSM), reportedly said at the chipmaker's annual shareholder meeting on Tuesday that US tariffs were having some impact on the company but that AI demand remained robust. According to aReuters report, Wei said: \"Tariffs do have some impact on TSMC, but not directly. That's because tariffs are imposed on importers, not exporters. TSMC is an exporter. However, tariffs can lead to slightly higher prices, and when prices go up, demand may go down.\" \"If demand drops, TSMC's business could be affected,\" he added. \"But I can assure you that AI demand has always been very strong and it's consistently outpacing supply.\" Wei reportedly said that TSMC, which is the world's biggest contract chipmaker, had expressed concerns about tariffs to the US Department of Commerce that levies could increase production costs in the US.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) \u2014 Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) shares have staged a $1 trillion rebound in two months \u2014 and investors are betting the rally has further to go as fears about the firm give way to optimism. Most Read from Bloomberg Where the Wild Children\u2019s Museums Are Billionaire Steve Cohen Wants NY to Expand Taxpayer-Backed Ferry The Economic Benefits of Paying Workers to Move At London\u2019s New Design Museum, Visitors Get Hands-On Access LA City Council Passes Budget That Trims Police, Fire Spending Last week\u2019s earnings report assuaged some key investor concerns: particularly whether US restrictions on the sales of advanced semiconductors in China would derail Nvidia\u2019s rapid revenue growth as well as the outlook for artificial intelligence spending, and the firm\u2019s ability to expand supply of its newest Blackwell chips. \u201cThose questions have been answered in the positive for Nvidia,\u201d said Thomas Martin, senior portfolio manager at Globalt Investments. \u201cIt\u2019s time to ramp back up your ownership.\u201d After soaring for two and a half years amid insatiable demand for its chips used in AI computing, Nvidia shares tumbled in the first few months of 2025 on concerns about President Donald Trump\u2019s trade policies and a potential pullback in spending by its biggest customers. Since an April low, however, the stock has rallied more than 45%, pushing Nvidia\u2019s market value to $3.4 trillion. That\u2019s just shy of Microsoft Corp., the world\u2019s most valuable company. Nvidia shares remain 8% below a record high in January. Despite the big advance, Nvidia trades at roughly 29 times profits projected over the next 12 months, well below the average over the past decade at 34 times. By contrast, the Nasdaq 100 is priced at 26 times despite Wall Street estimates calling for revenue growth this year that\u2019s a fraction of Nvidia\u2019s. The stock\u2019s PEG ratio \u2014 a measure of valuation relative to growth \u2014 is under 0.9, by far the lowest among the Magnificent Seven, which also includes Apple Inc. (AAPL), Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Alphabet Inc.(GOOGL,GOOG), Tesla Inc. (TSLA) and Meta Platforms Inc. (META). Of course, Nvidia is still exposed to US tariffs given its chips are manufactured overseas and could be hurt by a deterioration in trade relations with China, a country that accounted for 13% of revenue in the first quarter. However, purchase agreements with governments in the Middle East are seen as offsetting some lost sales and Nvidia\u2019s product pipeline is expected to keep competitors at bay. Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), Alphabet, and Amazon, which together comprise more than 40% of Nvidia\u2019s revenue, continue to invest aggressively in AI infrastructure. Capital expenditures for the four companies are projected to reach roughly $330 billion in 2026, up 6% from estimated spending this year, according to the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Amazon\u2019s cloud services chief on Friday reiterated the company\u2019s plan to aggressively expand its data centers. \u201cWe just haven\u2019t seen any kind of slowdown in AI spending, and so long as capex keeps moving up, we\u2019re unlikely to see the cycle roll over or Nvidia experience much compression to its multiple,\u201d said Samuel Rines, a macro strategist at WisdomTree. Nvidia is undervalued, according to Rines, who argues the ratio of price-to-projected earnings for the stock could rise to the high 30s or low 40s. Analysts are widely bullish on Nvidia. Of the 78 covering the stock, eight have hold ratings and only one says sell. The average price target sits at around $170, which would represent a gain of 24% from Monday\u2019s closing price, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Despite its popularity on Wall Street, the stock remains under-owned by market professionals relative to other Big Tech peers, suggesting the potential for more buying in the weeks to come. Nvidia is owned by 74% of long-only funds, according to data from Bank of America published on Friday. This puts it behind Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft, which is the most owned at 91%. The relatively low exposure coupled with demand for more computing infrastructure is likely to drive Nvidia shares higher into 2026, according to Angelo Zino, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research. \u201cThere were a lot of investors that really got out of this market prematurely and now they\u2019re kind of being forced back into it,\u201d Zino said. Tech Chart of the Day Microsoft has roared back in recent weeks cementing its position as the world\u2019s most valuable company.

        "content": "Chicago, IL \u2013 June 3, 2025 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA NVDA, Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF BOTZ, Range Nuclear Renaissance Index ETF NUKZ, Oklo OKLO and NuScale Power SMR. Welcome back to The Week in AI. I'm Kevin Cook, your field guide and story teller for the fascinating arena of artificial intelligence. Last week was full of goodies, highlighted by anNVIDIAearnings call that reassured investors the ramp of the new Grace Blackwell super systems was accelerating. In the video that accompanies this article, I go over the key numbers. I also address the second biggest (imo) reveal of the conference call: Jensen spent 2/3 of his opening remarks explaining the facts and consequences of using export controls on China. You can also get the details in this article... NVIDIA Earnings: 3 Giga Takeaways My second big AI news item in the video was the interview that Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei did with Axios where he expressed his concerns that few leaders were talking about the coming job disruption, especially for entry-level knowledge workers, aka \"white collar.\" The video shows several quotes and stats from him. Next up was my blunder for the week. I mistakenly took news about a partnership between Google and Reddit as recent, when the story was actually a year old. But it still helped me emphasize a larger trend: enterprises building LLMs (large language models) are running out of data on the open internet and elsewhere to train their models. This was the genius of Google getting exclusive rights to Reddit forums for only $60 million. Just think of the millions of threads where real humans exchange ideas, product reviews, and arguments. This clearly helped Google's Gemini catch up in the AI race. And this is why NVIDIA is creating platforms like Omniverse and Cosmos for enterprises to simulate the real world and then train autonomous machines like self-driving cars and humanoid robots on synthetic data. When you can run billions of training and reinforcement learning iterations in a matter of hours, then self-training inference can begin to take over and further accelerate the intelligence process. In the video, I share a little about one of the bright young challengers to Elon Musk's Optimus robots. Figure describes themselves as an \"AI Robotics company building the world's first commercially viable autonomous humanoid robot.\" Figure is still private, and has a dozen other serious competitors. So it should be exciting when these companies start to IPO. Meanwhile, I've been recommending investors grab a starter position in theGlobal X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF. NVIDIA is usually the largest holding and owning the ETF is a good, low-risk way to become familiar with the other companies. Speaking of ETFs, I also recommend investors grab the Range Nuclear Renaissance Index ETF because the datacenter build-out is creating a surge in demand for nuclear power innovations like the small modular reactors (SMRs). In the video, I highlight one company that has vaulted since President Trump initiated a new program to support the nuclear industry:Oklo. Here's what I wrote to my TAZR Trader members on Friday as we began more serious research on these companies (after I missed the April lows)... Btw, SMR stands for \"small modular reactor\" technology. Yes, I missed our chance to buy a nuclear company as they all \"exploded\" this week after the White House announced new policies to support the industry. Trump signed the executive orders last week attempting to speed up permitting for reactors and expand domestic enriched uranium production. Here's what some of the popular names did as they gapped up on Friday 5/23... NuScale Power+25%Oklosoared +29.5% William Blair initiated coverage on Centrus and Oklo this week. UBS felt compelled to double their PT on NuScale from $17 to $34, but maintained a Neutral rating. Subsequently the stocks all reached for new highs and are falling back, likely to fill some of their gaps. OKLO and SMR are very richly valued with sales just emerging. They remind me of our quantum plays trading over 100X sales. So the time is right for a low-risk ETF that gives us nuclear exposure and makes me follow the companies more closely (like I should have been). Incidentally, former Oklo board member Chris Wright now leads the U.S. Department of Energy. Following more closely would have put that info top of mind. Big picture, the country needs at least 50 of these new SMRs in the next decade to support the datacenter build-out. This should also have you thinking of some of the big E&C (engineering & construction) companies, like my colleague Tracy Ryniec who owns Sterling Infrastructure in her Value Investor portfolio. (end of excerpt from TAZR Trader) Be sure to watch the video to hear about other great AI resources on X, including Robert Scoble and Ethan Mollick.

        "header": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights NVIDIA, Advanced Micro Devices, Micron Technology and Broadcom",
        "content": "Chicago, IL \u2013 June 3, 2025 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Advanced Micro Devices AMD, Micron Technology MU and Broadcom AVGO. NVIDIA Corp.has seen its share price soar 18.7% over the past month. This surge has significantly outperformed the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector, which gained 6.9% during the same period. This outperformance raises the question: Is it time to take profits, or should investors continue holding NVDA as the rally extends? NVIDIA\u2019s recent surge has been driven in part by improving sentiment around U.S.-China trade. The two countries have rolled back tariffs, with the United States reducing tariffs on Chinese imports to 30% from 145%, while China cut duties on U.S. goods from 125% to 10%. These new terms will be in place for 90 days. This 90-day reprieve has eased concerns about prolonged trade disruptions, improving market sentiment and lifting stocks across sectors, especially tech and semiconductors. This broader rally has also powered gains in major semiconductor players, includingAdvanced Micro Devices,Micron TechnologyandBroadcom. Over the past month, shares of Advanced Micro Devices, Micron and Broadcom have risen 10%, 17.4% and 20.6%, respectively. For NVIDIA, this trade relief was just the catalyst needed to reignite buying interest in a stock already backed by strong fundamentals. Given its solid footing in AI and chip innovation, this rebound has legs, suggesting that holding the stock may still be the better call. NVIDIA\u2019s most powerful growth engine continues to be its Data Center business. In the first quarter of fiscal 2026, the segment brought in $39.1 billion in revenues, a staggering 89% of total company sales. This represents 73% year-over-year growth and a 10% sequential rise, primarily fueled by explosive demand for AI. The company\u2019s cutting-edge Hopper 200 and Blackwell GPU platforms are being rapidly adopted as cloud and enterprise customers race to scale up AI infrastructure. A large chunk of this growth is coming from hyperscalers, who are betting big on NVIDIA\u2019s GPUs to support their expanding AI workloads. With the Blackwell architecture promising up to 25x better AI inference performance than Hopper 100, NVIDIA continues to raise the bar. The upcoming Blackwell Ultra and Vera Rubin platforms are likely to strengthen its position further as global demand for AI computing accelerates. Despite some geopolitical setbacks, NVIDIA\u2019s financials remain rock solid. In the first quarter of fiscal 2026, revenues jumped 69% from the year-ago quarter, while non-GAAP earnings per share rose 33%. Even with an $8 billion expected revenue hit in the second quarter due to export restrictions on its H20 chips in China (after a $2.5 billion revenue loss in the first quarter), NVIDIA remains confident in its momentum. Its second-quarter guidance of $45 billion in revenues marks a 50% jump from the same quarter last year. Wall Street sees this trend continuing. The Zacks Consensus Estimate projects revenue growth of 51% in fiscal 2026 and 24% in 2027, with earnings growth of 40% and 32%, respectively. These numbers reinforce NVIDIA\u2019s position as a long-term growth story, one that remains intact despite near-term geopolitical hurdles. Valuation-wise, NVIDIA is overvalued, as suggested by the Zacks Value Score of D. In terms of forward 12-month Price/Earnings (P/E), NVDA shares are trading at 29.13X, higher than the sector\u2019s 25.52X. Compared with other major semiconductor players, NVIDIA is trading at a lower P/E multiple than Broadcom while at a higher multiple than Advanced Micro Devices and Micron Technology. At present, Broadcom, Advanced Micro Devices and Micron Technology are trading at P/E multiples of 32.91X, 23.49X and 9.61X, respectively. NVIDIA\u2019s strong fundamentals, dominant position in AI and impressive growth outlook make a compelling case for staying invested. While valuation is on the higher side, the company\u2019s momentum, both operationally and financially, supports holding the stock. NVIDIA carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at present.

        "content": "Shares of Dollar General (DG) jumped in premarket trading Tuesday after the discount retailer posted better-than-expected first-quarter results and lifted its full-year outlook. Dollar General reportedearnings per share (EPS)of $1.78 on net sales that increased 5% year-over-year to $10.44 billion. Analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha had projected $1.47 and $10.26 billion, respectively. Same store sales rose by 2.4%, roughly double the 1.22% bump analysts had forecast. Dollar General CEO Todd Vasos said the company is \"uniquely well-positioned to serve our customer in a variety of economic environments,\" noting that it gained market share growth across merchandise categories and both its core customer base as well as \"trade-in customers.\" The retailer lifted its outlook from what it laid outlast quarter. The company raised the floor of its full-year EPS forecast by 10 cents to a range of $5.20 to $5.80; increased its net sales growth projection to 3.7% to 4.7% from 3.4% to 4.4%; and sees same-store sales growth of 1.5% to 2.5% compared with the prior 1.2% to 2.2%. The company said that \"uncertainty exists for the remainder of the year regarding the potential impact of tariffs on the business, and particularly on consumer behavior,\" and added that it \"has plans in place\" if tariffs on China and other countries return to their April 2 levels. Dollar General expects it will be able to mitigate most of the cost increases brought on by tariffs, but said \"consumer spending could be pressured by tariff-related price increases.\" Dollar General shares were up 8% immediately following the report's release. They entered the day up about 28% since the start of the year. Discount store rival Dollar Tree (DLTR) is scheduled to report its own first-quarter earnings Wednesday morning.UBS analysts saidin a recent note that they believe there are \"more tailwinds than risks and uncertainties\" for dollar stores in the current environment, citing consumerslooking to trade downas a key benefit.",

        "header": "2 Buffett-Style Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Could Build Long-Term Wealth",
        "content": "Warren Buffett has proven his ability to deliver market-beating gains, and thanks to this, build wealth over the years. The billionaire investor, at the helm ofBerkshire Hathaway, posted a 19.9% compounded annual increase over nearly 60 years -- and that's as theS&P 500index recorded a 10.4% such gain. All of this helped his portfolio reach $258 billion as of the closing of the most recent quarter. Though Buffett's biggest holding isApple, the billionaire generally doesn't invest in technology stocks, so you might not think of turning to this top investor for inspiration when shopping for artificial intelligence (AI) players. But here's some good news: We actually can use some of Buffett's investing principles to identify smart buysin any industry. Here, I'll consider two elements that consistently drive Buffett's investment decisions, and these are valuation and competitive advantage. He aims to get in on stocks at a cheap or reasonable level, and he favors stocks that have what it takes to stay ahead of rivals over time. Let's check out two Buffett-style AI stocks that are winning in both of these areas -- and could build long-term wealth. Image source: The Motley Fool. Alphabet(GOOG-0.63%)(GOOGL-1.59%)is a company that you probably have some interaction with on a daily basis. The company owns Google Search, the world's most popular search engine with about 90% market share -- and this business has driven Alphabet's revenue and net income into the billions of dollars. This is the result of\u00a0 advertisers paying to promote their products and services across the Google platform in order to reach us. This search business hasa solid moat, or competitive advantage, thanks to its performance and position as part of our daily routine -- when we don't know something, we don't just search for it, we \"Google it.\" So, as long as Google Search continues to offer us the performance we expect, it's likely to maintain its leadership. And here's how Alphabet is ensuring that happens: The company has invested heavily in AI, even developing its own large language model (LLM), Gemini, to improve and expand the capabilities of Google Search. This should please users, and as a result, keep advertisers coming back and potentially even spending more. On top of this, the AI investment is helping Alphabet's Google Cloud business deliver double-digit revenue gains quarter after quarter. Google Cloud sells various AI products and services to customers, and demand is high as the AI boom continues. Along with this solid competitive advantage, Alphabet offers a valuation that might even please the bargain-hunting Buffett. Alphabet, trading for 18xforward earnings estimates, is the cheapest of theMagnificent Seventech stocks by this measure. Nvidia(NVDA1.17%)is clearly on every AI investor's radar screen. The company dominates the AI chip market, and this has helped it generate soaring earnings over the past few years -- with revenue and profit reaching record levels. But this stock doesn't look like it's in a bubble ready to burst. The company's solid reputation for excellence, along with its commitment to innovation, represents a moat. Nvidia aims to launch new AI chip updates on an annual basis, offering rivals little room to jump ahead. And here's something else Buffett would like: the quality of Nvidia's leadership. Jensen Huang founded Nvidia more than 30 years ago and has successfullyguided the companyever since. He's known for his resourcefulness, rapidlyfinding solutionsto problems, and commitment to keeping Nvidia ahead of the pack. Strong management is crucial for a company's long-term success, and Buffett has recognized the importance of this to him. \"When we own portions of outstanding businesses with outstanding managements, our favorite holding period is forever,\" he wrote in his 1988 letter to shareholders. Now, let's look at valuation. Nvidia isn't the cheapest AI stock around, but after recent declines across the sector, valuation has come down -- and today, it's at a very reasonable level considering the company's AI prospects. The stock trades for 31x forward earnings estimates, down from 50x earlier this year. So, right now, Nvidia's moat, leadership, and reasonable price make it a Buffett-style stock that could help investors build significant wealth over the long term.",

        "content": "June 3 - Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE), and Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) are among the server makers positioned tobenefitfrom Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) accelerating rollout of its latest AI chips, according to JPMorgan. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with DELL. Analyst Samik Chatterjee said Nvidia's Blackwell architecture accounted for about $24 billion in Compute revenue during the fiscal first quarter of 2026. That marked a sharp rise from $11 billion in the prior quarter, helped by a swift transition from Hopper chips. Nvidia's total revenue rose 12% sequentially and 69% from a year earlier, reaching $44.1 billion, modestly ahead of consensus. Datacenter revenue grew 10% Q/Q and 73% Y/Y to $39.1 billion, driven by strong uptake of Blackwell-based systems. JPMorgan noted hyperscalers are deploying 1,000 NVL 72 racks per week, with management calling it the fastest ramp in the company's history. Nvidia expects fiscal Q2 revenue to range from $44.1 billion to $45.9 billion, implying about 2% growth Q/Q. The forecast includes an $8 billion headwind from H20 export restrictions. Chatterjee flagged solid server demand from Dell, HPE, and SMCI as a potential tailwind, especially heading into the July quarter. With hyperscalers ramping Blackwell deployments at unprecedented speed, Dell, HPE, and Super Micro stand to capture substantial incremental revenue and expand market share by supplying the critical server infrastructure needed to power Nvidia's AI-driven growth.

        "content": "Pinterest (PINS) shares rose in premarket trading Tuesday after JPMorgan analysts upgraded their rating and lifted their price target on the social media stock. The analysts lifted the stock to \"Overweight\" from \"Neutral,\" and bumped their price target to $40 from $35. That brings JPMorgan in line with most other analysts covering the stock who are tracked by Visible Alpha, as 16 call it a \"Buy\" and just four a \"Hold,\" with an average price target of $39.75. They noted that while Pinterest shares are up since the start of the year, they are still about 18% below their February highs while theS&P 500has recovered to just about 3% below its February record level that month. Pinterest is \"leveraging its full funnel ad approach and automation/AI capabilities\u2014including Performance+\u2014to capture a greater share of ad spending\" from advertisers with $1 billion to $30 billion in annual revenue, the analysts wrote. Some larger advertisers are already spending 5% to 10% of their advertising budget on the platform, they added. The social media platform is growing itsmonthly active users (MAU)base, with 85% coming directly to Pinterest through its mobile app, the analysts said. They cited that number as a key reason for their upgrade, as Pinterest generates roughly 90% of its revenue through its app, \"which limits PINS' exposure to Google & broader overall search disruption,\" they wrote. Pinterest shares, which entered the day up 10% this year, rose 4% less than an hour before the opening bell.",

        "content": "By Stephen Nellis SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) -Cornelis Networks on Tuesday released a suite of networking hardware and software aimed at linking together up to half a millionartificial intelligencechips. Cornelis, which was spun out of Intel in 2020 and is still backed by the chipmaker's venture capital fund, is targeting a problem that has bedeviled AI datacenters for much of the past decade: AI computing chips are very fast, but when many of those chips are strung together to work on big computing problems, the network links between the chips are not fast enough to keep the chips supplied with data. Nvidia took aim at that problem with its $6.9 billion purchase in 2020 of networking chip firm Mellanox, which made networking gear with a network protocol called InfiniBand, which was created in the 1990s specifically for supercomputers. Networking chip giants such as Broadcom and Cisco Systems are working to solve the same set of technical issues with Ethernet technology, which has connected most of the internet since the 1980s and is an open technology standard. The Cornelis \"CN5000\" networking chips use a new network technology created by Cornelis called OmniPath. The chips will ship to initial customers such as the U.S. Department of Energy in the third quarter of this year, Cornelis CEO Lisa Spelman told Reuters on May 30. Although Cornelis has backing from Intel, its chips are designed to work with AI computing chips from Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices or any other maker using open-source software, Spelman said. She said that the next version of Cornelis chips in 2026 will also be compatible with Ethernet networks, aiming to alleviate any customer concerns that buying Cornelis chips would leave a data center locked into its technology. \"There's 45-year-old architecture and a 25-year-old architecture working to solve these problems,\" Spelman said. \"We like to offer a new way and a new path for customers that delivers you both the (computing chip) performance and excellent economic performance as well.\" (Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by Leslie Adler)",

This partnership underscores the company's relentless pursuit of technological advancements, coinciding with an impressive 20% rise in stock price over the last month. The broader market has enjoyed a steady climb, up 2% last week and 12% over the past year, but NVIDIA's substantial earnings report and strategic alliances likely added weight to its performance. Upcoming initiatives and positive earnings forecasts continue to position NVIDIA as a key player in the evolving tech landscape. NVIDIA has 1 possible red flag we think you should know about. AI is about to change healthcare. These 23 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10b in market cap - there's still time to get in early. The collaboration between NVIDIA and Illumio, which enhances cyber resilience through the NVIDIA BlueField networking platform, could bolster NVIDIA's strategic push into critical infrastructure technology. This partnership aligns with NVIDIA's ongoing emphasis on advancing its technological prowess and may drive further growth in its data center and AI workloads, which are crucial components of the company's revenue streams. The news underpins the existing narrative of NVIDIA's expansion plans, specifically in the context of its ambitious foray into the realms of AI and next-generation data processing. Over the past five years, NVIDIA's total return, including dividends, soared to a very large percentage, reflecting its impressive growth trajectory. When compared to the US market's performance over the past year, alongside the semiconductor industry, NVIDIA's gains stand out, as both the broader market and the industry have seen significantly smaller returns in comparison. The company's share price, currently trading at US$113.54, showcases a discount to analyst consensus price target of US$170.76, suggesting potential room for growth should NVIDIA meet or exceed future earnings and revenue expectations. Revenue and earnings forecasts could be positively influenced by the increased demand for advanced AI solutions and data center products, driven by NVIDIA's technological innovations and strategic partnerships, like the ones with Toyota and Uber in the automotive sector. Nevertheless, potential challenges such as U.S. regulatory issues and export controls in China may impact NVIDIA's growth trajectory. The price movement witnessed in NVIDIA's shares, combined with the positive outlook from analysts, underscores the need for ongoing assessment of the company's operational efficiencies and market conditions as it pushes towards its long-term targets.

The innovative semiconductor company, which uses gallium nitride (GaN) and silicon carbide (SiC) instead of the standard silicon, announced a new partnership today, as well as presented at a prominent industry conference. The company will partner with BrightLoop to bring its advanced chip technology to BrightLoop's latest series of hydrogen fuel-cell chargers. The charges are designed to support efficient and green power to heavy-duty agricultural transportation equipment. Given the enormous power requirements of equipment of this scale, the deal is further validation of Navitas' approach and technology. The company also presented today at the Baird Global Consumer, Technology & Services Conference 2025. CEO Gene Sheridan laid out his vision for the company's future, focusing on its shift toward high-voltage power solutions -- the same solutions that helped it ink the BrightLoop deal.

The news sent Navitas stock flying, not only because of the direct monetary value of the deal, but because of the incredible validation of its technology. If Nvidia is backing Navitas, it's likely others will follow in its footsteps and invest in GaN and SiC chip solutions from Navitas.

        "header": "Nvidia\u2019s\u00a0chips are among the world\u2019s hottest commodities.\u00a0So why is the company likely trashing $4.5 billion worth of them?",
        "content": "Nvidia\u2019s blockbuster quarterly earnings last week came with a big dose of negative news: A $4.5 billion write down on chips originally destined for customers in China that will ultimately go undelivered. The company had developed the so-called H20 chips, which are less powerful than its top-of-the-line semiconductors, to comply with Biden Administration regulations against sending technology to foreign adversaries that could help their AI efforts. The Trump Administration, however, went a step further in early April and banned exports of even second-tier chips. \u201cWe are taking a multibillion dollar write off on inventory that cannot be sold or repurposed,\u201d saidNvidiaCEO Jensen Huang on a May 28 earnings call. The details around the decision to write the value of the chips to zero\u2014rather than sell them to other customers\u2014wasn\u2019t explained. The company added, without elaborating, that it\u2019s \u201cexploring limited options\u201d for the unused inventory, a move that would apparently fall short of selling the chips. The H20 was built specifically for the China market under the old export rules. Because of the chip\u2019s design and limited capabilities, it may be difficult to use in other countries. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really fit anywhere else without a lot of expensive tweaking,\u201d says Arash Azadegan, a professor of supply chain management at Rutgers Business School. This tweaking could involve additional costs for Nvidia. Furthermore, some of the chips may \u201cnot meet the performance needs of customers in other regions\u201d or may be engineered \u201cspecific to Chinese customer requests or requirements,\u201d says Chad Autry, a University of Tennessee supply chain professor. Even if it could sell the chips by cutting their price, Nvidia would risk damaging its image as a seller of top-tier innovation. The company\u2019s new Blackwell GPUs, after all, power cutting-edge AI like OpenAI\u2019s yet-to-be-released GPT-5 model. \u201cNvidia probably doesn\u2019t want to flood the market with discounted chips\u2014it could mess with their pricing, confuse customers, and distract from their big push into the newer Blackwell lineup,\u201d says Azadegan, referencing Blackwell\u2019s used in new products from Amazon\u2019s AWS,MicrosoftAzure,GoogleCloud, andOracle, among others. Nvidia declined to comment beyond what its executives said during the company\u2019s earnings call last week. After China-based DeepSeek released its ChatGPT rival in January, major Chinese firms like Alibaba, ByteDance, and Tencentpurchased Nvidia\u2019s H20 chips, Reuters reported in February. These companies have likely developed powerful AI capabilities using H20 chips, so there\u2019s little reason to believe that U.S. companies could not do the same if Nvidia sold H20 to them. But Nvidia and U.S.-based customers probably have no interest in this, says Matthew Bryson, a Wedbush Securities managing director who covers Nvidia. \u201cThe reason that these products are going to China is because everyone would choose something better.\u201d Bryson explains that the technology underpinning H20s \u201cwould never have been made\u201d if not intentionally engineered to prevent Chinese firms from building models similar to U.S.-made advanced AI applications. And if Nvidia sold the chips at a big discount to reflect their U.S. market value, it could \u201ccannibalize\u201d sales of better products, he says. Nvidia had initially expected to have to write off $5.5 billion of chip inventory from its balance sheet. But it managed to salvage about $1 billion of H20 inventory by \u201c[reusing] certain materials,\u201d reducing the realized first-quarter writeoff to $4.5 billion, chief financial officer Colette Kress said on last week\u2019s earnings call. Unsurprisingly, she noted that as a result of\u00a0 the Trump Administration\u2019s new export rule, Nvidia will take a revenue hit from Trump\u2019s China ban in the first half of the year. The company booked a $2.5 billion loss in first quarter revenue and predicted a steeper $8 billion revenue loss in the second one. The question remains of what happens with this H20 stockpile. Supply chain experts interviewed byFortunesuspect it will be discarded. \u201cThese chips will meet the \u201ccool lava lamp\u201d you got from your aunt in a landfill somewhere,\u201d Alan Amling, a professor of supply chain at the University of Tennessee\u2019s Haslam College of Business, wrote toFortunevia email. \u201cWith so many other growth opportunities, the opportunity cost of repurposing, retesting and requalifying these chips was obviously too high a bar.\u201d Because of how quickly the new export rules under Trump took effect, the undeliverable H20 chips are likely sitting in U.S.-friendly places like Taiwan and Hong Kong, said University of Tennessee\u2019s Autry. Taiwan-based TSMC manufactures much of Nvidia\u2019s inventory meant for China-based customers, and Nvidia\u2019s fulfillment partners are in nearby countries. Writing off the H20 chips had minimal short-term impact on Nvidia\u2019s otherwise booming business. Nvidia reported first quarter revenue of $44.1 billion (up 69% year-over-year) and $18.8 billion in net income, representing a healthy 42.6% net profit margin. Writing down the full value of the chips provides an immediate tax benefit by reducing the company\u2019s taxable income. Depending on Nvidia\u2019s future sales prospects and costs, this benefit could outweigh or come close to the financial benefit of selling the chips at a steep discount. \u201cNvidia is going to be alright; investors of Nvidia are going to be alright,\u201d says Rutgers\u2019 Azadegan. \u201cThe real story,\u201d he said, is that Nvidia\u2019s manufacturing partners like TSMC and suppliers, includingSamsungand Micron, could be most impacted by the H20 inventory writeoff because they\u2019ve built businesses by serving critical functions in Nvidia\u2019s supply chain. The magnitude of the impact to these partners will be determined in the months and years ahead, notes Azadegan. \u201cIt\u2019s never on a dime that we can pivot.\u201d Nvidia analyst Harsh Kumar ofPiper Sandleris hopeful that Trump eventually undoes the blockade on H20 chips to China. If so, Nvidia could finally complete the H20 sales or deliver the chips to new customers in China, assuming the company holds onto the H20 inventory. It\u2019s unclear how realistic this scenario is after the Trump administration appealed a judge-imposed block on his \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs. Still, Trump\u2019s new export ban prevents Nvidia from delivering chips to China for national security reasons, so it may have little to no correlation with his tariff agenda. \u201cTo me, it almost implied that there is a pathway that Jensen [Huang] and Nvidia see for this H20 chip to be sold back into China,\u201d Kumar toldFortune, potentially helping to propel the company\u2019s already high-flying stock to greater heights in the future.

        "content": "Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) delivered fiscal second-quarter results that topped analysts\u2019 expectations and narrowed its full-year profit forecast. The server maker posted revenue of $7.63 billion, up 6% year-over-year and above the analyst consensus from Visible Alpha.Its adjusted net income of $545 million, or 38 cents per share, fell from $561 million, or 42 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter, but topped estimates. HP Enterprise shares gained over 3% in after-hours trading. The stock was down 17% for 2025 through Tuesday\u2019s close. Looking ahead, HP Enterprise raised the low end of its full-year forecast for adjusted earnings per share to $1.78 from $1.70, while keeping the high end at $1.90.Wall Street had called for adjusted EPS of $1.78. Meanwhile, the company's third-quarter revenue forecast of $8.2 billion to $8.5 billion beat analysts' expectations, and its adjusted EPS estimate of 40 cents to 45 cents landed roughly in line. The results come after the company reported in April that activist investor Elliott Investment built a more than$1.5 billion stakein the company. The firm has been in the spotlight recently for its influence on the operations of Southwest (LUV), which recently implemented a number ofchangesincluding ending its \u201ctwo bags fly free\u201d policy. HP Enterprise CFO Marie Myers said the company remains focused on \"achieving efficiencies and streamlining operations across our businesses.\"",

        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA,Financials)surged over 45% from its April low, adding $1 trillion in value and closing in on Microsoft's (MSFT,Financials) spot as the world's most valuable company, according to Bloomberg. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with NVDA. Despite the sharp rally, Nvidia trades at about 29 times projected earnings over the next 12 months below its 10-year average of 34 times. The stock's price-to-earnings-to-growth ratio is under 0.9, the lowest among major tech peers, signaling potential undervaluation. Bloomberg data shows analysts remain bullish, with 69 of 78 rating the stock a buy and only one issuing a sell. The average price target implies a further 24% upside. Investors have shaken off early-year concerns tied to U.S.-China tensions and semiconductor sales restrictions. Bloomberg reported Nvidia lost $2.5 billion in Q1 sales from a China chip ban and expects an $8 billion hit in Q2, but demand elsewhere appears strong. U.S. tech giants including Microsoft, Amazon (AMZN,Financials), Alphabet (GOOG,Financials) and Meta Meta Platforms (META,Financials) are projected to spend $330 billion on AI infrastructure in 2026, up 6% from 2025, helping sustain Nvidia's growth momentum. Still, trade exposure lingers. China contributed 13% of Nvidia's revenue in Q1. With President Trump's administration threatening broader tech restrictions, Nvidia could face further headwinds. CEO Jensen Huang said no new China-focused products are planned for now, but the company is monitoring the policy environment. Nvidia's relatively low institutional ownership 74% of long-only funds, compared with 91% for Microsoft leaves room for additional buying pressure. Analysts like Samuel Rines of WisdomTree argue Nvidia's earnings multiple could rise into the high 30s or low 40s as AI capex accelerates. Investors will continue to watch for signals from Washington on trade, as well as ongoing data center demand trends. This article first appeared onGuruFocus.",

        "content": "Some Wall Street forecasters see stocks closing out 2025 at record highs\u2014despite a shaky start to the year. Deutsche Bank analysts led by Chief US Equity & Global Strategist Binky Chadha on Tuesday raised their year-endS&P 500 targetto 6,550, a number suggesting about 10% upside from Tuesday\u2019s close.\u00a0That would be nearly 7% above the index's record close from earlier this year. Investor positioning, they said, is close to neutral and assumes tariffs will be a slight drag on earnings growth this year. \u201cHowever, if there is confidence that tariff impacts will be modest and temporary, we expect discretionary investors to look through any slowing in growth and turn overweight in anticipation of a rebound,\u201d they wrote. The analysts expect robust corporate demand to shrink the supply of stock on public markets. They forecast companies will spend $1.1 trillion onstock buybacksthis year, thanks to resilient earnings. Deutsche Bank raised its estimate of the S&P 500\u2019s aggregate full-year earnings per share to $267 from $240. The firm entered the year forecasting index-level earnings of $282 per share. But it slashed that outlook in mid-April shortly after President Trump paused\u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffsfor 90 days and lifted rates on Chinese goods to 145% at a minimum. Earnings, they estimated, would suffer from a prohibitively high effective tariff rate and the lingering possibility of a prolonged trade war. The outlook improved last month when the U.S. and China agreed to slash their respective tariff rates while officials negotiated a more comprehensive trade deal. Tensions between the world\u2019s two largest economies linger: This weekend each partyaccusing the other of violating their tentative agreement. Still, the White House\u2019s approach to tariff negotiations has some market watchers feeling optimistic. Deutsche Bank\u2019s analysts take the White House\u2019s decision to pause \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs just hours after they took effect, \u201cbefore the emergence of any legal barriers or economic or political pain,\u201d as a sign that \u201cif negative impacts of tariffs do materialize, we will get further relents.\u201d As such, Deutsche Bank expects this year\u2019s rally to 6,550 to benefit investors who bet on Trump relenting.\u201cDespite the rhetoric to the contrary, the 2018-2019 dynamic of repeated cycles of escalation and de-escalation predicated on the market looks to be alive and well.\u201d",

        "content": "AI data centers are expected to consume a massive amount of energy in the coming years, and meeting that need could be a boon to some investments, according to Morgan Stanley. Morgan Stanley forecasts U.S. data centers will consume 65 gigawatts of power between 2025 and 2028, but available capacity could fall short by about 45 GW. To make up the difference, \u201call potential \u2018de-bottlenecking\u2019 solutions will need to be drawn upon,\u201d the analysts wrote in a note on Tuesday. Possible solutions, they say, include convertingcrypto miningoperations into data centers, building data centers at large nuclear power plants, and constructing new natural gas-fired power plants. But all of that is easier said than done. First, therising price of bitcoincould discourage miners from converting their mining facilities or selling excess power to data centers. Second, concerns about stressing regional power grids could compel regulators to mandate that new data centers not come online until additional power sources are connected to the grid. That\u2019s why Morgan Stanley expects to see hyperscalers anddata-centerowners adopt a \u201cbridge\u201d approach, \u201cin which temporary, mobile generation is deployed\u201d to address the regulatory and economic hurdles to quickly ramping power capacity. Small modular nuclear reactors are one solution that gives companies the flexibility they\u2019ll need. SMRs have the added benefit of providing reliable carbon-free energy that aligns with Big Tech\u2019s emission-reduction goals. However, small reactors are a nascent, \"next decade technology,\" Morgan Stanley analysts said. For that reason, cloud hyperscalers like Microsoft (MSFT),Alphabet(GOOG),Amazon(AMZN), and Meta Platforms (META) increasingly have turned to existing nuclear infrastructure during the AI buildout of the past few years. Meta on Tuesdaysigned a 20-year dealwith Constellation Energy (CEG), America's largest nuclear power provider, to sustain its AI.Constellation and Microsoft last yearagreedto bring back online a reactor at Pennsylvania's Three Mile Island. With SMRs still a ways off, new data centers are likely to rely on small, mobile natural gas generators from the likes of GE Vernova (GEV) and Caterpillar (CAT). Hyperscalers may also buy from fuel cell manufacturers like Bloom Energy (BE), whose electricity servers are a low-carbon way to convert natural gas,biofuel, or hydrogen into power. These fuel cells, the analysts said, offer the benefit of short lead times, reliable equipment, the ability to add redundant capacity in the event of a unit failure, and exceptional flexibility in terms of power output. \u201cWe believe [Bloom Energy] could quickly increase manufacturing capacity to ~3 GW per year, with the potential for further increases in output if demand grows,\u201d the analysts wrote. \u201cBloom Energy is in our view one of the under-appreciated beneficiaries of the rapid growth in data center power demand globally.\u201d",
