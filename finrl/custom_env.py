class RiskAwareStockTradingEnv(StockTradingEnv):
    """
    This is a custom class built for Agent 2's Trading Environment to take the news sentiment risk scores into consideration during its trading steps.
    This class inherits the StockTradingEnv class from FinRL, and only overwrittes the step() function to give 'reward' or 'penalty' to the agent depending on the risk scores. 
    The amount of 'reward' or 'penalty' is indicated by a given weight value. 
    For example, a lower risk score signals optimistic chance in its trade, thus the agent's state[0] is multiplied with a high weight ('reward').
